we are a leading global provider of metal detectors  x ray visioning equipment and checkweighers that are used in these industries 
metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself 
x ray based vision inspection helps detect non metallic contamination  such as glass  stones and pits  which enter the manufacturing process for similar reasons 
our x ray systems can also detect metal in metallized containers and can be used for mass control 
checkweighers are used to control the filling content of packaged goods such as food  pharmaceuticals and cosmetics 
both x ray and metal detection systems may be used together with checkweighers as components of integrated packaging lines 
freeweigh 
net is our statistical and quality control software that optimizes package filling  monitors weight related data and integrates it in real time into customers enterprise resource planning and or process control systems 

table of contents retail weighing solutions supermarkets  hypermarkets and other food retail businesses make use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for handling fresh goods such as meats  vegetables  fruits and cheeses 
we offer stand alone scales for basic counter weighing and pricing  price finding and printing 
in addition  we offer networked scales and software  which can integrate backroom  counter  self service and checkout functions and can incorporate fresh goods item data into a supermarket s overall food item and inventory management system 
customer benefits are in the areas of pricing  merchandising  inventory management  and regulatory compliance 
the retail business accounted for approximately of our net sales in retail software our subsidiary softechnics provides retail software for in store item and inventory management solutions 
softechnics offering complements our retail weighing solutions to food retailers by providing the full scope of real time item management 
retailers can then match local store inventory levels with local customer demand 
as our traditional retail weighing business extends further into the area of information technology  the opportunity to cross sell softechnics software and services will expand 
we continue to introduce softechnics software for the improved inventory management of fresh goods and plan to sell more complete and integrated data management solutions for fresh goods now and in the future 
customers and distribution our principal customers include companies in the following key end markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies  as well as independent research organizations  food producers  food retailers  the beverage industry  specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies  the transportation and logistics industry  the metals industry  the electronics industry  and the academic community 
our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels 
generally  more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force  while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels 
our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels 
a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through the indirect channels  including sales of our ohaus branded products 
ohaus branded products principally target the educational market and other markets in which customers are interested in lower cost  a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service 
we have a diversified customer base  with no single customer accounting for more than of net sales 
sales and service market organizations we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service 
the market organizations are local marketing and service organizations designed to maintain close relationships with our customers 
each market organization has the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions 
market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives and relaying new product and application ideas 
we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers 
at december   our sales and services group consisted of over  employees in sales  marketing and customer service including related administration and post sales technical service  located in countries 
this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe 
this is important because our customers are seeking to do more and more business with a consistent global approach 

table of contents service we have expanded our service business from one focused on repair and maintenance to one driven by regulatory compliance and other value added services 
we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer s location around the world 
this global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets 
we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world 
in  service representing service contracts  repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 
beyond revenue opportunities  we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention 
the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provides us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 
research and development and manufacturing producing organizations our research  product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations 
our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs  improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership 
the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices  and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 
research and development we intend to continue to invest in product innovation in order to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications 
over the last three years  we have invested million in research and development million in  million in  and million in 
in  we spent approximately of net sales on research and development 
our research and development efforts fall into two categories technology advancements  which increase the value of our products 
these advancements may be in the form of enhanced functionality  new applications for our technologies  more accurate or reliable measurement  additional software capability or automation through robotics or other means  and cost reductions  which reduce the manufacturing cost of our products through better overall design 
we continue to devote an increasing proportion of our research and development budget to software development 
this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments  application specific software  and software that connects our solutions into customers existing it systems 
we closely integrate research and development with marketing  manufacturing and product engineering 
we have over employees in research and development and product engineering 
manufacturing we are a worldwide manufacturer  with facilities principally located in china  germany  switzerland  the united kingdom and the united states 
laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china  while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide 
we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations  and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications 
we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process 
all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso certification 
we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 
we generally manufacture only critical components  which are components that contain proprietary technology 
when outside manufacturing is more efficient  we contract with other manufacturers for certain non proprietary components 
we use a wide range of suppliers 
we believe our supply arrangements are 
table of contents adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials 
from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component 
supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 
backlog  seasonality our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short  which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products 
backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 
our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation  particularly the high end laboratory instruments business 
traditionally  sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than  and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters 
fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately of our net sales 
this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees throughout the world  including approximately  in europe   in north and south america  and  in asia and other countries 
we believe our employee relations are good  and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years  except for a strike in early at our bethune  france facility  which has been closed 
labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 
intellectual property we hold over  patents and trademarks  primarily in the united states  switzerland  germany  the united kingdom  france  japan and china 
our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations  some of which are protected by patents of various durations 
products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents  and as a result  no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business 
we have numerous trademarks  including the mettler toledo name and logo  which are material to our business 
we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 
regulation our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities 
all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 
approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments  and are themselves not affected by other instruments 
in addition  some of our products are used in legal for trade applications  in which prices based on weight are calculated  and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required 
although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets  there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards  and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 
our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the end user and market 
for example  laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp  industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp  pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations  and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations 
products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 

table of contents environmental matters we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world 
like many of our competitors  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities 
our subsidiary mettler toledo hi speed  inc hi speed is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep signed on june  with respect to certain property in landing  new jersey 
gei international corporation gei is the other ordered party 
gei has failed to fulfill its obligations under the njdep consent order  and njdep has agreed with hi speed that the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site 
the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures  but rather as institutional controls that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated 
we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately million in the coming years 
in addition  certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and  over such time  some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous 
it is possible that these sites  as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes  may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and  to date  we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
competition our markets are highly competitive 
weighing and analytical instruments markets are fragmented both geographically and by application  particularly the industrial and food retailing markets 
as a result  we face numerous regional or specialized competitors  many of which are well established in their markets 
in addition  some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own 
taken together  the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices 
although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors  we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 
these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions  our global brand and reputation  our track record of technological innovation  our comprehensive  high quality solution offering  our global sales and service offering  our large installed base of weighing instruments  and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region  product range and customer 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in research and development  sales and marketing and customer service and support 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying  developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 
we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself  application support  service support and price 
in emerging markets  where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products  price is a more important factor than in developed markets 
competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

table of contents item a 
risk factors factors affecting our future operating results we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging markets 
we conduct business in many countries  including emerging markets in asia  latin america and eastern europe and these operations represent a significant potion of our sales and earnings 
for example our chinese operations account for million of sales to external customers and million of segment profit 
in addition to the currency risks discussed below  international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us 
for instance  various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements 
in addition  we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks tariffs and trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  and or mandatory salary increases for local employees  credit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local customers and distributors  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  nationalization of private enterprises may result in the confiscation of assets as we hold significant assets around the world in the form of property  plant and equipment  inventory and accounts receivable  as well as million of cash at december  in our chinese subsidiaries  restrictions on investments and or limitations regarding foreign ownership  adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and other uncertain local economic  political and social conditions  including hyper inflationary conditions  or periods of low or no productivity growth 
we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies 
for example  converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals 
if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations  we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 
economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time deteriorated significantly  and some emerging markets are experiencing recessionary trends  severe currency devaluations and inflationary prices 
moreover  economic problems in individual markets can spread to other economies  adding to the adverse conditions we face in emerging markets 
we remain committed to emerging markets  particularly those in asia  latin america and eastern europe 
however  we expect the fluctuating economic conditions will affect our results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable future 
we operate in highly competitive markets  and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins  gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 
our markets are highly competitive 
weighing and analytical instruments markets are also fragmented both geographically and by application  particularly the industrial and food retailing markets 
as a result  we face numerous regional or specialized competitors  many of whom are well established in their markets 
in addition  some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our company 
taken together  the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with 
table of contents competitive prices 
although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors  we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 
our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 
we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner  or our products could become technologically obsolete over time  which would harm our operating results 
to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments in research and development  sales and marketing  and customer service and support 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments 
in developing new products  we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability 
as a result  we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 
our ability to deliver products and services may be disrupted 
an interruption in our business due to acts such as natural disasters  fires  explosions  or issues with the supply chain may cause us to temporarily be unable to deliver products or services to our customers 
it may be expensive to resolve these issues  even though we hold certain insurance 
more importantly  customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 
a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical  food  food retailing and chemicals industries could adversely affect our operating results 
our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical  food and beverage and chemical industries 
consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemicals industries hurt our sales in prior years 
a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control  including the resources available for purchasing equipment  the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures 
any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 
we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 
we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company 
if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future  completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners  increases in our debt and contingent liabilities  and additional amortization expenses related to intangible assets 
any of these acquisition related risks could have a material adverse affect on our profitability 
larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering  which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets 
in addition  we may not be able to identify  successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future 
however  even if we can do so  we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights  or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others  our operating results could be harmed 
our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets 
our patents may not provide complete protection  and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents 
our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed 
although we take measures to protect confidential information  improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 

table of contents we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome  and management attention could be diverted 
if we are unsuccessful in such litigation  we may have to pay damages  stop the infringing activity and or obtain a license 
if we fail to obtain a required license  we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could result in a decline in our revenues 
departures of key employees could impair our operations 
we have employment contracts with each of our key employees 
in addition  our key employees own shares of our common stock and or have options to purchase additional shares 
nevertheless  such individuals could leave the company 
if any key employees stopped working for us  our operations could be harmed 
we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 
we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes  and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 
we incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in various facilities 
in addition  some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future 
these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation 
accordingly  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies 
our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies 
these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products  from design and development  to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales and distribution 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution 
in addition  we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 
we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections 
in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  economic conditions  future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses 
the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth  controllable cost growth  perpetual growth  effective tax rates and discount rates 
our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 

table of contents should any of these estimates or assumptions change  or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows  we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units  possibly prior to the required annual assessment 
these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 
our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions  and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction  changes in tax laws or tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and material adjustments from tax audits 
in particular  the carrying value of deferred tax assets  which are predominantly in the us  is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition  the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 
currency fluctuations may affect our operating profits 
because we conduct operations in many countries  our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
swiss franc denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss franc denominated sales represent of our net sales 
in part  this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland 
moreover  a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland 
therefore  if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg  the us dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the japanese yen  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies 
therefore  when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc  it also decreases our operating profits 
accordingly  the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important cross rate monitored by the company 
we estimate that a strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of approximately million on an annual basis 
in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits  our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
based on our outstanding debt at december   we estimate that a weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 
we have substantial debt and we may incur substantially more debt  which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 
we have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
as of december   we had total indebtedness of approximately million  net of cash of million 
we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness  subject to the restrictions therein 
our debt could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital  capital expenditures  product development and other corporate requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  including changes in raw material costs  
table of contents limit our ability to respond to business opportunities  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  which may be necessary  and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants  which  if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured  could result in an event of default under our debt 
the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 
the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business 
these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to enter into sale and leaseback arrangements  incur liens  and consolidate  merge  sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets 
our credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions  and are subject to the risks in this section 
the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the senior notes and or under our credit facility 
an event of default under our credit facility would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable 
acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes

overview we operate a global business  with sales that are diversified by geographic region  product range and customer 
we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors  including the strength of our brand name and reputation  our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions  and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 
net sales in us dollars increased by and in and  respectively 
excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations  or in local currencies  net sales increased and in and  respectively 
we enjoyed an improved world economy in compared to recent years with improved market conditions in europe  continued solid growth in the united states and generally strong demand in most asian countries 
in respect to our end user markets  we experienced improved results during in our laboratory related end user markets  such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies  food and beverage companies and universities 
we believe that the long term fundamentals of the pharmaceutical and biotech markets are particularly attractive and our solutions assist these companies in enhancing their productivity as they meet the challenges of new drug approval activity  heightened price regulation and industry consolidation 
in our industrial markets  the principal growth driver in recent years has been increased investment in china related to production capacity 
although this provides a significant opportunity for our chinese operations  this manufacturing shift has a negative impact on certain of our industrial end user markets in the us and europe 
however despite this challenge  our us and european industrial end user markets experienced solid sales growth during in our food retail end markets  we experienced strong results in both europe and the us related to increased project activity 
traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors 
increased spending in the past has come from events such as yk and the introduction of the euro currency 
while we have not experienced similar triggering events in recent years  we have enjoyed strong overall demand in similar to our industrial business  china also provides growth as the expansion of their local economy is creating a significant number of new retail stores each year 

table of contents in  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years gaining market share 
our global sales and marketing initiative  spinnaker  continues to be an important growth strategy 
we aim to achieve above market sales growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our global sales and marketing processes 
while this initiative is broad based  efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation activities  the implementation of more effective pricing strategies and processes and further automation of field processes 
our comprehensive service offering also helps us further penetrate developed markets 
in addition to traditional services  we offer installation  calibration  regulatory compliance services and remote service support 
expanding emerging markets 
we have a two pronged strategy in emerging markets first  to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second  to leverage our low cost manufacturing operations in china 
we have nearly a year track record in china  and our sales in asia have grown more than per year in local currency since we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china 
we are shifting more of our manufacturing to china to reduce costs  where our three facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export 
we are also experiencing rapid growth in india from increased life science research activities  as well as our acquisition of our distribution channel for laboratory products in in addition  russia continues to be an important growth driver due in part to the expansion of their local economy 
extending our technology lead 
we continue to focus on product innovation 
in the last three years  we spent between and of net sales on research and development 
we seek to drive shorter product life cycles  as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software 
in addition  we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 
maintaining cost leadership 
we continue to strive to improve our margins by reducing our cost structure 
as previously mentioned  shifting production to china has been an important component of our cost savings initiatives 
we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs 
our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency  such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 
pursuing strategic acquisitions 
while we have not completed a significant acquisition since  acquisitions remain part of our growth strategy 
we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network  respected brand  extensive distribution channels and technological leadership 
we have identified life sciences  product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions 
results of operations consolidated net sales net sales were  million for the year ended december   compared to  million in and  million in this represents increases in and of and in us dollars and and in local currencies  respectively 
in  our net sales by geographic destination increased in local currencies by in the americas  in europe and in asia rest of world 
a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services 
service revenues are primarily derived from regulatory compliance qualification  calibration  certification and repair services  much of which is provided under contracts  as well as sales of spare parts 
net sales of products increased in and by and in us dollars and by and in local currencies  respectively 
service revenue including spare parts increased in and by and in us dollars and by and in local currencies  respectively 

table of contents net sales for our laboratory related products increased in local currencies during with strong growth in process analytics  laboratory balances and analytical instruments 
net sales of our industrial related products increased in in local currencies 
we experienced sales growth in our core industrial products  most notably our heavy industrial and standard industrial weighing products  as well as our product inspection products  especially x ray products 
in our food retailing markets  net sales increased in in local currencies over the previous year due to increased sales across all geographic regions  particularly in europe and the us  related to strong project activity 
the food retailing markets also continue to experience improved growth of software solutions 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for  compared to for and for gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was for  compared to for and for gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was for  compared to for and for the increase in gross profit percentage reflects benefits from our sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs  our cost rationalization initiatives and the impact of increased pricing 
these trends were offset in part by unfavorable product mix and lower margin project activity 
research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were for  compared to for and in research and development expenses increased by in and decreased by in in local currencies 
our research and development spending levels reflect improved productivity  the timing of projects and our desire to reallocate research and development resources to marketing 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to for  compared to for and for selling  general and administrative expenses increased in and in in local currencies 
this increase is due in part to share based compensation expense in of million  sales and marketing investments  particularly in china  higher performance related compensation as well as charges associated with our cost reduction programs in during  we incurred million related to an investigation into allegations made by an employee with respect to the company and various company processes 
other income charges  net other income charges  net consisted of other income  net of million in  compared to other charges  net of million in and million in other income charges  net consisted primarily of interest income  gains losses from foreign currency transactions  gains losses from sales of assets and other items 
in  other income charges  net includes increased interest income associated with higher cash balances in the us as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation during associated with the american jobs creation act of during  other income charges  net also included a million charge related to litigation 
we wrote off a million intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license that was subject to litigation with the grantor in june this license enabled one of our wholly owned subsidiaries exclusive rights to distribute certain third party manufactured pipettes in the united states 
a judgment entered on june  terminated the license agreement and awarded damages to the other party 
we also incurred million of related legal costs during  which included damages of million 
the damages of million were subsequently reversed during 
table of contents interest expense and taxes interest expense was million for  compared to million for and million for the increase in and was principally due to higher average borrowings over the prior year due to our increased debt balance in europe as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation during associated with the american jobs creation act of during the third quarter of  we implemented a legal reorganization that resulted in a reduction of the estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items from to 
in addition to the change in our annual effective tax rate  we recorded three discrete tax items a charge of million related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards  a benefit of million associated with a reduction of a liability previously established for estimated costs to repatriate unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries  and a favorable tax law change resulting in a benefit of million 
pursuant to the american jobs creation act of  we repatriated million of cash during that was generated over time by our foreign operations 
as a result of this repatriation  we recorded additional income tax expense of million 
this amount reflects the federal tax impact in the united states including certain state taxes of million  foreign withholding taxes of million and a net decrease of million of deferred tax liabilities associated with the reassessment of pre existing and future dividend repatriations 
in addition  we recorded tax benefits of million related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters 
our tax rate for also included a tax benefit associated with the previously described litigation 
excluding the tax effects of the previously described discrete tax items  our annual effective tax rate would have been  and for  and  respectively

net earnings in also included the previously described discrete tax items amounting to a million net benefit 
the results included a one time million million after tax charge related to the litigation described above 
net earnings in also included a million net after tax expense related to the previously described discrete tax items 
the results included million million after tax related to the previously mentioned investigation 
the increase in net earnings excluding these items primarily reflected improved sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs  benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives and a reduced tax rate in net earnings per diluted share were for compared to in and in net earnings per diluted share for includes of share based compensation expense and a benefit of related to the previously described discrete tax items associated with a legal reorganization and the favorable tax law change

net earnings per diluted share for includes of expense related to the previously described investigation 
net earnings per diluted share  as reported  increased during compared to in and in excluding the effect of share based compensation  the one time litigation charge  discrete tax items and investigation charge  net earnings per diluted share would have increased in  in and in in addition to our improved net earnings  the increase in net earnings per diluted share also benefits from our share repurchase program 

table of contents results of operations by operating segment the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments 
we currently have five reportable segments us operations  swiss operations  western european operations  chinese operations and other 
a more detailed description of these segments is outlined in note to our consolidated financial statements 
us operations increase in increase in vs 
vs 
net sales net sales to external customers segment profit represents us dollar growth decline for net sales and segment profit 
the increase in total net sales during is the result of improved sales to external customers and includes solid growth across most products  particularly our food retailing products due to strong project activity as well as continued growth in our in store retail software solutions 
the increase in in total net sales reflected improved sales to external customers across most product lines  including particularly strong results in our food retailing and transportation and logistics products due to significant project activity as well as solid growth in laboratory balances  process analytics and analytical instruments 
segment profit increased million in our us operations segment during  compared to an increase of million during the increase in segment profit for  was primarily due to increased sales volume and our ability to leverage our fixed production costs and benefits of our cost rationalization initiatives 
the increase in segment profit of our us operations segment during is due to an increase in sales volume  partially offset by an unfavorable product mix 
swiss operations increase in increase in vs

net sales net sales to external customers segment profit represents us dollar growth decline for net sales and segment profit 
total net sales in local currency increased in and in net sales to external customers in local currency increased in and decreased by in the exit of our third party electronic component product line reduced total net sales by approximately in the increase in sales to external customers during related primarily to particularly solid growth in our laboratory related and industrial related products offset in part by reduced project activity 
we also experienced strong export sales growth to emerging markets 
the decrease in sales in related primarily to the exit of our third party electronic component product line combined with reduced food retailing project activity and reduced direct export sales to emerging markets  partially offset by a strong increase in our industrial related products 
segment profit increased million in our swiss operations segment during  compared to an increase of million during the increase in segment profit in is primarily due to increased sales volume  our ability to leverage our fixed production costs  particularly for laboratory balances  and favorable currency translation fluctuations 
the increase in segment profit is partially offset by changes in intercompany pricing to other segments and higher research and development expense 
the increase in segment profit in primarily related to increased sales to other segments of laboratory related products as well as benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives 

table of contents western european operations increase in increase in vs 
vs 
net sales net sales to external customers segment profit represents us dollar growth decline for net sales and segment profit 
total net sales in local currency increased in and in net sales to external customers in local currency increased in and in the increase is primarily due to improved market conditions across most countries 
we also experienced strong sales growth in our food retailing products primarily related to project activity  as well as solid growth in our laboratory related products  particularly process analytics 
the increase was primarily due to improved market conditions in the major european economies  especially germany 
we experienced sales growth in across most product lines  particularly laboratory related products 
segment profit increased million in our western european operations segment during  compared to an increase of million in the increase in segment profit for is principally a result of increased net sales volume and our ability to leverage our fixed production costs 
these benefits were partly offset by costs associated with our ongoing cost rationalization activities 
the increase in segment profit in is primarily a result of increased net sales and benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives 
chinese operations increase in increase in vs 
vs 
net sales net sales to external customers segment profit represents us dollar growth decline for net sales and segment profit 
total net sales in local currency increased in and in net sales to external customers in local currency increased in and in these increases were due to continued sales growth for all product lines  in particular industrial related products 
segment profit increased million in our chinese operations segment during  compared to an increase of million in the increase in and segment profit is primarily due to the continued improvement in sales volume and leveraging our fixed production costs

net sales net sales to external customers segment profit represents us dollar growth decline for net sales and segment profit 
total net sales in local currency increased in and in net sales to external customers in local currency increased in and in this performance reflected increased sales in our other asian pacific  eastern european and other north american markets 

table of contents segment profit increased million in our other operations segment during  compared to an increase of million during segment profit increased during primarily due to strong sales volume  improved cost levels and inventory charges that occurred during segment profit increased during primarily due to the continued improvement in sales volume 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing 
currently  our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements  capital expenditures  share repurchases and acquisitions 
in  we have also increased our debt balance in europe and our cash balance in the united states as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation associated with the american jobs creation act of cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in resulted principally from improved operating results and reduced inventory levels  which was offset in part by a million voluntary incremental pension contribution to our uk pension plan 
the increase in resulted principally from improved operating results offset in part by approximately million of higher payments relating to performance related compensation incentives bonus payments 
cash provided by operating activities in was impacted by voluntary incremental pension contributions of million to our us pension plan 
similar to previous years  we expect to make normal employer pension contributions of approximately million in capital expenditures are made primarily for machinery  equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities 
our capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in we expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change 
in  we launched a building project for a new plant in china which will cost in the range of million to million over a two year period 
we continue to explore potential acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition  we may incur additional indebtedness 
november refinancing on november   we entered into a revised credit agreement the amended credit agreement  which amended and restated the existing credit agreement  dated as of november  the amended credit agreement increased the amount that can be borrowed under the facility from million to million  extended the maturity date to november and lowered the margin applicable to the interest rate payable thereunder 
the remaining terms of the amended credit agreement are substantially the same as under the existing credit agreement 
we incurred fees of approximately million in conjunction with amending and restating the credit agreement which are amortized to interest expense through amended credit agreement the million amended credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of november  it is not subject to any scheduled principal payments 
borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our senior unsecured credit ratings currently bbb by standard poor s and baa by moody s and is currently set at libor plus 
we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our credit ratings 
the amended credit agreement contains covenants  including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization of less than to and an interest coverage ratio of more than to this also places certain limitations on us  including limiting the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a subsidiary level 
in addition  the amended credit agreement has several events of default  including upon a change of control 
as of december   approximately million was available under the facility 
the amended credit agreement is unsecured 

table of contents senior notes in november  we issued million of unsecured senior notes due november  the senior notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
interest is payable semi annually in may and november 
discount and issuance costs approximated million and are being amortized to interest expense over the seven year term of the senior notes 
at our option  the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the senior notes  or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date on a semi annual basis at a comparable treasury rate plus a margin of the senior notes contain limitations on our ability to incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding of our consolidated net worth 
our short term borrowings and long term debt consisted of the following at december  other principal us dollar trading currencies total million senior notes net of unamortized discount million amended credit agreement other local arrangements long term total long term debt other local arrangements short term total debt changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity 
in addition  because we borrow in a variety of currencies  our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our amended credit agreement and senior notes 
in addition  we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 
we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities  together with liquidity available under our amended credit agreement and local working capital facilities  will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the next several years 

table of contents contractual obligations the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years short and long term debt interest expense on long term debt non cancelable operating leases pension funding purchase obligations total in addition to the above table  we also have liabilities for income taxes  pension and post retirement funding however we cannot determine the timing or the amounts for periods beyond for income taxes and beyond for pension and post retirement funding 
we have purchase commitments for materials  supplies  services and fixed assets in the normal course of business 
due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes  certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions 
we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition 
this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 
share repurchase program we have a share repurchase program 
under the program  we have been authorized to buy back up to million of equity shares 
as of december   there were million of remaining equity shares authorized to be repurchased under the plan by december  the share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash balances  borrowings and cash generated from operating activities 
repurchases will be made through open market transactions  and the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity  business and market conditions  the stock price  trading restrictions and other factors 
we have purchased million shares since the inception of the program through december  during the years ended december  and  we spent million and million on the repurchase of  shares and  shares at an average price of and  respectively 
an additional million and million relating to the settlement of shares repurchased as of december  and were cash settled during and  respectively 
we reissued  shares and  shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options during and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements currently  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 
effect of currency on results of operations because we conduct operations in many countries  our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
swiss franc denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss franc denominated sales represent of our net sales 
in part  this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland 
moreover  a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and 
table of contents administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland 
therefore  if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg  the eg dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the japanese yen  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies 
therefore  when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc  it also decreases our operating profits 
accordingly  the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important cross rate that we monitor 
we estimate that a strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of million to million on an annual basis 
in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits  our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
based on our outstanding debt at december   we estimate that a weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 
taxes we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world 
our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors  such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions  the tax rates in such jurisdictions  tax treaties between jurisdictions  the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions  earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law 
generally  the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a non consolidated non combined basis or ii on a consolidated combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction  in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non consolidated non combined affiliated legal entities 
as a result  we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period 
environmental matters we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world 
like many of our competitors  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad 
our subsidiary mettler toledo hi speed  inc hi speed is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep signed on june  with respect to certain property in landing  new jersey 
gei international corporation gei is the other ordered party 
gei has failed to fulfill its obligations under the njdep consent order  and njdep has agreed with hi speed that the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site 
the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures  but rather as institutional controls that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated 
we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at the site will be approximately million in the coming years 
in addition  certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and  over such time  some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous 
it is possible that these sites  as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes  may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation 
accordingly  although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents inflation inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use  including raw materials to manufacture our products 
the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 
moreover  there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products  which may limit our ability to recover increased costs 
we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe  which have experienced inflationary conditions 
to date  inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results 
however  as our presence in china and eastern europe increases  these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge short term intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis 
such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations 
the fair value of these contracts was a million gain and a million loss at december  and  respectively 
a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currency denominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency us dollar  swiss franc and british pound declined by  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million at december   as compared with a decrease of million at december  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
we also have other currency risks as described under effect of currency on results of operations 
we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements 
these contracts are more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of these contracts was a million loss at december  and based on our agreements outstanding at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of million  as compared with a decrease of million at december  conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a million increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december   as compared with a net increase of million at december  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to pensions and other post retirement benefits  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue and warranty costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the 
table of contents application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
employee benefit plans the net periodic pension cost for and projected benefit obligation as of december  were million and million  respectively  for our us pension plans  and million and million  respectively  for our international pension plans 
the net periodic post retirement cost for and expected postretirement benefit obligation as of december  for our us post retirement medical benefit plan were million and million  respectively 
pension and post retirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations 
the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods 
while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets  which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities 
in april  we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees 
consequently  no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans 
for  the weighted average return on assets assumption was for the us plan and for the international plans 
a change in the rate of return of would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately million after tax 
the discount rates for defined benefit and post retirement plans are set by benchmarking against high quality corporate bonds 
for  the average discount rate assumption was for the us plans and for the international plans  representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist 
a decrease in the discount rate of would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately million after tax 
in and  we made voluntary incremental funding payments of million and million  respectively  to reduce the under funded status of our uk and uk pension plans 
in the future  we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required to make additional cash funding payments 
equity compensation we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and other equity based awards which  as of january   are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grant date fair value of the award under sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
prior to january   these equity awards were accounted for under the intrinsic value method pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
note to the audited consolidated financial statements provides supplemental information  including pro forma earnings and earnings per share  as if we had accounted for options based on the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
these methodologies yield an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates  the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives 
changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 

table of contents inventory as of december   inventories were million 
we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost  which includes direct materials  labor and overhead  is generally determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on forecast usage  orders and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  reductions in the value of inventory may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections 
in preparing the valuation models  we consider a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  economic conditions  future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses 
the most significant of these estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include estimated cash flows resulting from estimates of sales growth and controllable cost growth  perpetual growth  effective tax rates and discount rates 
our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 
as of december   our intangible assets included a million indefinite life intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license 
this license was previously subject to litigation with the grantor  and on june   we were ordered to pay million in damages and the respective intellectual property license was terminated 
due to the cancellation of the license  we concluded that the intangible asset had no future benefit and as such  during the second quarter of  we wrote off the total value of the asset  million million after tax 
this charge has been included as a component of other charges  net within the statement of operations 
the damages of million were subsequently reversed during should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs change  or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows  we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units  possibly prior to the required annual assessment 
these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 
our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 
income taxes income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our 
table of contents deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income  equity or goodwill in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company has undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries and currently believes that there will be no cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings 
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  or should our income mix from our geographical regions change  our effective tax rate could be materially affected 
based on earnings before taxes of million for the year ended december   each increase of million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled 
standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and  accordingly  title transfers upon shipment 
in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery  we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred 
other than a few small software applications  we do not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument 
our typical solution requires no significant production  modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products 
to the extent our solutions have a post shipment obligation  such as customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed 
in addition  we also defer revenue where installation is required  unless such installation is perfunctory 
we also generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions and we also maintain accruals for outstanding credits 
distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized 
revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period 
warranty we generally offer one year warranties on most of our products 
product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material  freight and vendor charges  our cost of goods sold could be affected
