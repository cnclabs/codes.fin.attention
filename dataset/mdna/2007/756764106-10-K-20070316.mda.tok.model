item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a nyse listed hospitality and leisure company ticker symbols rlh and rlh pa primarily engaged in the ownership  operation  development and franchising of midscale and upscale  full service hotels 
the red lion brand is nationally recognized  particularly in the western united states  and is typically associated with three and four star full service hotels 
our mission is to create the most memorable guest experience possible  allowing us to be the leader in our markets through personalized  exuberant service 
as of december   our hotel system contained hotels located in nine states and one canadian province  with  rooms and  square feet of meeting space 
we operate in three reportable segments the hotels segment derives revenue primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage operations at our owned and leased hotels 
the franchise and management segment is engaged primarily in licensing the red lion brand to franchisees and managing hotels for third party owners 
this segment generates revenue from franchise fees that are typically based on a percent of room revenues and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brand and access to our central services programs 
these programs include the reservation system  guest loyalty program  national and regional sales  revenue management tools  quality inspections  advertising and brand standards 
it also reflects revenue from management fees charged to the owners of our managed hotels  typically based on a percentage of the hotel s gross revenues plus an incentive fee based on operating performance 
the entertainment segment derives revenue primarily from ticketing services and promotion and presentation of entertainment productions 
we have historically owned certain commercial real estate properties 
we also have engaged in traditional real estate related services  including developing  managing and acting as a broker for sales and leases of commercial and multi unit residential properties collectively referred to as the real estate management business 
together  these operations comprised our real estate segment 
effective april   we divested the real estate management business 
in addition  consistent with our strategy of divesting non core assets  during the fourth quarter of  we listed one of our two remaining wholly owned commercial real estate properties for sale and have classified its results of operations within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
further  the remaining operations of that segment have been reclassified to other for and for all comparative periods  where appropriate 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
executive summary during and  we focused our resources monetary  capital and human in three primary areas infrastructure improving the foundation of the corporation including focusing on our core competencies  improving our liquidity and capital resources  improving the infrastructure used to manage reservations and support our hotel system and increasing our depth of resources through targeted additions to our leadership team 
physical assets improving our product  including the physical assets presented to our guests and the feel of our guest experience 
growth preparing for growth  especially in the franchise arena  means creating consistent upscale brand standards throughout our hotel system  enhancing the service delivery presented to our customers and developing and connecting with our associates in an effort to better meet the expectations of our guests 
during  we had growth of in hotel room revenues and in direct hotel operating profit 
we completed extensive room renovations at our hotels and enhanced our capital structure through the combination of successfully completing a follow on equity offering  and subsequently repaying debt and obtaining a new credit facility 
these accomplishments have elevated the red lion brand and laid the foundation for our goal of expansion into new markets 
as we move into  we will continue to focus on growing our existing operations  expanding 
table of contents into new markets and taking advantage of opportunities for new franchises  joint ventures and acquisitions 
we believe the red lion brand and our financial position are both strong 
we began our enhancements by initially improving the quality of our existing product in areas where customers quality expectations are continuing to grow 
this allows us to take advantage of the growth potential in our existing markets  as well as make the red lion brand more attractive for franchise opportunities 
as of december   we had substantially completed our hotel room renovations  which included new floor and wall coverings  tiled bathroom floors  granite vanities and other bathroom upgrades  enhanced guest room features including new plush pillow top mattresses and upgraded linen and pillow packages  large work desks and ergonomic chairs and amenities such as complimentary wireless internet access 
guest reaction to our renovations has been positive and during  we realized strong increases over prior years in adr and revpar  although we experienced lower occupancy primarily due to the impact of displacement during the implementation of our room renovation plan  as well as our strategy of transitioning to higher rate corporate and group stays  from lower rate promotional and permanent contract business 
the lodging industry as a whole also saw improvements in its underlying fundamentals during  which we anticipate will continue during a comparative summary of the performance of our hotel system  including all hotels owned  leased  managed and franchised for each of the periods presented  is as follows for the year ended december  average average average occupancy adr revpar occupancy adr revpar occupancy adr revpar red lion hotels owned and leased hotels franchised hotels total red lion hotels system wide change from prior comparative period red lion hotels owned and leased hotels franchised hotels total red lion hotels system wide system wide includes all hotels owned  leased  managed and franchised  presented on a comparable basis for hotel statistics 
this includes one managed property and one hotel held as discontinued  neither utilizing the red lion brand 
average occupancy represents total paid rooms divided by total available rooms 
total available rooms represents the number of rooms available multiplied by the number of days in the reported period and includes rooms taken out of service for renovation 
average daily rate adr represents total room revenues divided by the total number of paid rooms occupied by hotel guests 
revenue per available room revpar represents total room and related revenues divided by total available rooms 
we continue to increase room bookings as a result of our red lion brand strengthening campaign  increased marketing efforts and technological upgrades 
travelers continue to book more reservations through electronic distribution systems like our own branded website and third party on line travel agents ota s  or also referred to as alternative distribution systems or ads 
we have started installing a property management system in our 
table of contents hotels that shares the same database as our central reservations system  allowing us to improve in delivered rates and availability and helping us take advantage of internet travel bookings 
we have also focused on encouraging guests to reserve accommodations on our website through our we promise or we pay booking initiative 
through this initiative  we guarantee to our guests that our website will provide the best rate available compared to non opaque ota channels 
as a result  our website is the fastest growing electronic reservation channel  allowing us to maximize our yield on these types of bookings 
we intend to grow our hotel operations to markets by the end of  primarily by expanding the number of hotels franchised  managed  joint ventured or owned under the red lion brand 
we expect to add properties in large  western us urban markets  complemented by leading properties in smaller  secondary cities  and progressively move east  leveraging the momentum of our growth in the western states 
financially  we have a strong balance sheet to advance this growth 
in  we reduced our long term liabilities by over million primarily as a result of our second quarter public offering of million shares of red lion common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  during we added a new revolving credit facility for up to million  which  as of december   had no amounts outstanding 
we have the option to increase the facility to million  subject to certain conditions 
a summary of our comparative consolidated balance sheet is as follows december  consolidated balance sheet data in thousands working capital assets of discontinued operations other assets held for sale property and equipment  net total assets liabilities of discontinued operations total long term debt debentures due red lion hotels capital trust total liabilities total stockholders equity represents current assets less current liabilities  excluding assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and assets held for sale

table of contents results of operations for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of approximately million or per common share  compared to net income of million or per common share in and a net loss of million or per common share in a summary of our consolidated statement of operations is as follows year ended december  in thousands  except per share data total revenue operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense expense of early extinguishment of debt minority interest in partnerships  net other income  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit net loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss the net loss in was significantly impacted by million in expense recognized for the early extinguishment of debt

in addition  we expensed approximately million related to unamortized deferred loan fees associated with this debt 
these expenses for the early extinguishment of debt were partially offset by a gain 
table of contents recognized of million related to an incentive achieved for meeting development targets in connection with the renovation and expansion of a hotel 
operating income from continuing operations increased in from  and we realized improvements over prior years in revpar  adr and occupancy  as well as increased margins from our hotel segment compared to and  as discussed above in thousands year ended december  hotels revenue direct margin direct margin franchise and management revenue direct margin direct margin entertainment revenue direct margin direct margin operating income continuing operations only 
revenues less direct operating expenses 
ebitda represents net income or loss before interest expense  income tax benefit expense and depreciation and amortization 
we utilize ebitda as a financial measure because management believes that investors find it to be a useful tool to perform more meaningful comparisons of past  present and future operating results and as a means to evaluate the results of core on going operations 
we believe it is a complement to net income and other financial performance measures 
ebitda from continuing operations is calculated in the same manner  but excludes the operating activities of business units identified as discontinued 
ebitda is not intended to represent net income loss as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  and such information should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  cash flows from operations or any other measure of performance prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
we use ebitda to measure the financial performance of our owned and leased hotels because we believe interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization bear little or no relationship to our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance irrespective of our capital structure or how we finance our properties and operations 
we generally pay federal and state income taxes on a consolidated basis  taking into account how the applicable taxing laws apply to us in the aggregate 
by excluding taxes on income  we believe ebitda provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of our operations excluding factors that our hotels cannot control 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  which can vary from hotel to hotel based on historical cost and other factors unrelated to the hotels financial performance  ebitda measures the financial performance of our hotels without regard to their historical cost 
for all of these reasons  we believe that ebitda provides us and investors with information that is relevant and useful in evaluating our business 
we believe that the presentation of ebitda from continuing operations is useful for the same reasons  in addition to using it for comparative purposes for our intended operations going forward 
however  because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  it does not measure the capital we require to maintain or preserve our fixed assets 
in addition  because ebitda does not reflect interest expense  it does not take into account the total amount of interest we pay on outstanding debt nor does it show trends in interest costs due to changes in our borrowings or changes in interest rates 
ebitda from continuing operations excludes the activities of operations we have determined to be discontinued and does not reflect the totality of operations as experienced for the periods presented 
ebitda  as defined by us  may not be comparable to ebitda as reported by other companies that do not define ebitda exactly as we define the term 
because we use ebitda to evaluate our financial performance  we reconcile it to net income  which is the most comparable financial measure 
table of contents calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income loss determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity 
the following is a reconciliation of ebitda and ebitda from continuing operations to net income loss for the periods presented in thousands year ended december  ebitda income tax benefit expense interest expense depreciation and amortization net income loss ebitda from continuing operations income tax benefit interest expense depreciation and amortization net loss from continuing operations income loss on discontinued operations net income loss revenue a breakdown of our revenues from continuing operations is as follows in thousands year ended december  revenues from continuing operations hotels room revenue food and beverage revenue other department revenue total hotels segment revenue franchise and management revenue entertainment revenue other revenue total revenue compared to during  revenue from the hotels segment increased million  or  compared to rooms department revenue increased million  or  driven by rate increases 
occupancy was slightly lower year on year  both due to the impact of rooms displaced by renovations as well as to our strategic decision to move from lower rate volume and contract business to higher rate and more profitable corporate  transient and group business 
the rate increases were affected by the mix strategy  but were also due to upward rate flexibility allowed by our capital investment in our hotels 
food and beverage revenue increased in from  primarily due to increased banquet related revenues 
we anticipate an increased demand for banquets as we complete our public area renovations  resulting in further improvements in revenue for our food and beverage services 
incidental revenues from guest amenities and other sources of revenue for the hotel segment were down between 
table of contents comparative periods  primarily due to the continued decrease in room telephone and movie revenues and the closure of gift shops within two hotels  subsequently  the space has been leased to third party retail businesses 
in  we completed the implementation of our stay comfortable initiative and began major room renovations in several hotels including new floor and wall coverings  tiled bathroom floors  granite vanities and other bathroom upgrades  enhanced guest room features including new plush pillow top mattresses and upgraded linen and pillow packages  large work desks and ergonomic chairs and amenities such as complimentary wireless internet access 
in  this work was substantially completed and work began on common areas such as lobbies and restaurants 
guest reaction to renovations in the hotels has been positive and we experienced a period of strong growth in in our hotels segment and saw improvement in its underlying fundamentals 
the adr increases between comparable periods experienced in the first and second quarters of accelerated in the second half of the year 
occupancy was lower in the first half of due to displacement and slightly lower in the second half of as we changed our mix of business 
overall revpar grew by from that experienced in we continue to believe the lodging industry as a whole will continue to see increases in adr and revpar in and beyond 
through  our strategy was to increase occupancy through strategic marketing and investment in our properties  and then to increase rates as demand increased for our rooms 
for six consecutive quarters through june  we increased occupancy 
we built on this demand by increasing the average daily rate during the second half of in the majority of our markets 
in  as we completed our renovation program  we began to see our ability to increase room rates accelerate  driving a increase in adr between the third quarter of and the third quarter of and an increase between the fourth quarter of and the fourth quarter of the higher adr and revpar significantly contributed to an increase in segment direct profit of to million in from million in during the second quarter of  we completed installation of the new micros opera property management system opera in of our red lion hotels 
an additional hotel went live with the system in the second quarter of opera shares a single database with our central reservations system allowing for better yield management 
combined with our redesigned website  opera further enhances our ability to manage reservations generated through all electronic channels and helps position us to efficiently and economically take advantage of electronic travel bookings 
our brand strengthening initiatives  marketing efforts and technological upgrades are achieving desired results 
travelers continue to book more reservations through electronic distribution systems like our own branded website and third party on line travel agents otas  or also referred to as alternative distribution systems or ads 
our central reservations and distribution management technology allows us to manage the yield on these ota channels on a real time  hotel by hotel basis 
our focus on driving customers to our branded website has made it the fastest growing source of online reservations  allowing us to further maximize our yield on those types of bookings 
we have merchant model agreements with leading ota providers  which typically entitle the provider to keep a fixed percentage of the price paid by the customer for each room booked allowing us to maximize the yield of a typically lower rated market segment 
our success in managing these rates reflects our management of these distribution channels and our merchant model agreements 
we have continued to increase bookings as a result of our sales efforts  the stay comfortable advertising campaign and the we promise or we pay branded website booking initiative 
the we promise or we pay initiative is designed to encourage guests to book on our branded website  www 
redlion 
com 
through this initiative  we guarantee to our guests that our branded website will provide the best rate available compared to non opaque ota channels 
we also launched a marketing campaign designed specifically to increase awareness of our netguests and room amenity upgrade programs known as stay comfortable 
netguests provides hotel guests access to free high speed wireless internet 
we believe that a unique aspect of our netguests program is that members of our guestawards loyalty program can use our hotels as a hot spot at any time  even if they are not staying at the hotel 
revenue from the franchise and management segment remained steady at million in and included in revenues are a franchise termination fee of  increased revenues from the addition of franchises from previously company owned properties and increased revenues from increased revpar at these 
table of contents hotels 
this impact was offset by million received in for a management contract termination fee triggered by the sale of a property that left our system in entertainment segment revenue increased in from  driven primarily by the result of differences in the type and mix of shows presented 
ticketing revenue in aggregate was relatively constant 
the entertainment segment generates greater revenue when it presents shows on a gross basis only  compared to net productions in which it only receives commissions for tickets sold 
during  we presented seven gross shows and two net shows  compared to four gross and four net shows during during the fourth quarter of  we presented a six week net production of disney s the lion king  for which we received commissions for tickets sold and other fees 
other revenue decreased from to primarily as a result of the sale of the real estate management business in  as well as of the kalispell mall in compared to hotels segment revenues from continuing operations for the twelve months ended december   increased or million  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to growth of about million in room revenue between comparable periods  or 
average occupancy for owned and leased hotels that are part of continuing operations was up percentage points for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the total available rooms used to calculate average occupancy includes rooms taken out of service for renovation 
in addition  adr was up to 
the resulting revpar from owned and leased hotels that are part of continuing operations was higher than revpar of in the increases in hotels segment revenues were partially offset by declines of million in food and beverage revenue as compared to the year ended december   primarily related to a decrease in banquet revenue related to less convention group business in incidental revenues from guest amenities and other sources of revenue for the hotel segment were down million between comparative periods 
revenue from the franchise and management segment in was up million over  related primarily to two additional franchise agreements in place during the second quarter of  partially offset by one less management contract 
entertainment segment revenue was down for the comparative periods 
the decrease was primarily due to the fourth quarter presentation of a six week net production of disney s the lion king  for which we received commissions for tickets sold and other fees 
comparatively  the entertainment division generated less revenue but substantially more profit on the lion king than it did on the two shows it presented on a gross basis in the fourth quarter of  for which it realized all the revenues but also incurred all the expenses 
ticketing revenues increased during the year which offset part of the decrease in show revenues 
other revenues in decreased from primarily due to the sale of of the kalispell mall

overall  the segment had a direct profit of million in compared to million in depreciation and amortization increased in from  primarily related to increased capital additions in and related to hotel renovations 
the net gain on asset dispositions increased by million in from  primarily due to a million gain on the divestment from the real estate management business in april the sale of the real estate management business was in exchange for  shares of common stock that was subsequently retired  as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the net gain on asset dispositions also reflects the ongoing recognition of deferred gains on a previously sold office building and a hotel for which we entered into a long term lease arrangement 
undistributed corporate expenses were million higher in from primarily attributable to expenses associated with equity compensation under sfas no 
r  which became effective for us on january   and costs to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act  which became effective for us as of december  undistributed corporate expenses include general and administrative charges such as corporate payroll  legal expenses  charitable contributions  director and officers insurance  bank service charges and outside accountants and various other consultants expense 
we consider these expenses to be undistributed because the costs are not directly related to our business segments and therefore are not further distributed 
however  costs that can be identified to a particular segment are distributed  such as accounting  human resources and information technology  and are included in direct expenses 

table of contents compared to in the aggregate  operating expenses for the year ended december   increased million to million from million in direct hotel expenses increased million or between comparative periods

depreciation and amortization increased million or between and  primarily related to our capital improvement plan 
for the year ending december  and  the net gain recognized on asset disposals included the recognition of deferred gains over time on both a previously sold office building and a hotel 
a gain of million was recorded for the sale of a interest in our kalispell center and mall to an unrelated third party and a million gain related to the sale of four condominiums during the third quarter of during  gains were partially offset by a small loss on certain personal property disposed of as part of our reinvestment plan 
undistributed corporate expenses for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to higher payroll costs  costs associated with options issued to directors as part of the board compensation plan and costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act paid to outside consultants

also included in the total expense is approximately million related to remaining unamortized deferred loan fees on the debt 
of the million debenture repayment in june  we paid a premium of approximately million for its early retirement 
offset by a million forgiveness of debt related to an incentive achieved for meeting development targets in connection with the renovation and expansion of a hotel 
other income expense the change in other income loss in from is primarily due to interest income on invested cash balances derived from the proceeds of asset sales in and and from our public offering in may income taxes compared to income tax benefit on continuing operations recognized for and was million and million  respectively 
the experienced rate on pre tax net income differed from the statutory combined federal and state tax rates primarily due to the utilization of certain incentive tax credits allowed under federal law

liquidity and capital resources we believe that our recent actions and initiatives have strengthened our financial position 
further we believe our overall strategy has positioned us for growth and success in our long term operating plans and has strengthened the value of the red lion brand 
these actions  which included improving our capital structure  continued disposition plan for non core assets and a major hotel renovation plan  have created a strong foundation for growth 
as we enter  our short term liquidity needs include funds for operating activities  interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and capital expenditures 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and from our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  we may also draw upon our million credit facility 
at december   we had an additional million of restricted cash available under securitized borrowing arrangements for future payment of furniture  fixtures and equipment  repairs  insurance premiums and real and personal property taxes 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property acquisitions  renovations and other non recurring capital improvements through net cash provided by operations  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  including our new credit facility  and joint ventures 
during the second quarter of  we completed a common stock offering for proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting costs and other associated expenses of approximately million 
including the exercise of the underwriter s option  we issued and registered  shares of our common stock at per share 
the proceeds from the offering were used primarily to retire existing debt and pay associated defeasance costs 
the offering expanded our public market float and analyst coverage in the investment community and increased our liquidity and financial flexibility 
another major initiative in has been the hotel capital improvement and reinvestment plan for our owned and leased hotels 
the capital investment program represents one of the most significant facility improvement programs in company history 
we are seeking to create an enhanced guest experience across our hotel portfolio 
the investment accelerates our ongoing program to improve hotel quality by increasing customer comfort  freshening decor and modernizing with new technology 
we believe that by improving the quality of our existing product in areas where customers quality expectations are growing  we both position our hotels to take advantage of the growth potential in our existing markets  and make the red lion brand more attractive for franchise opportunities 
in and  we spent a total of million and million  respectively  on capital improvements 
substantially all of the room related renovations have been completed  with our focus in early primarily in non room guest contact areas such as lobbies  exteriors  and banquet rooms 
our capital improvements have been financed in large part through the divestment of identified non strategic owned hotels  a commercial office building and certain other non core properties including condominium units and parcels of excess land  which provided us with total cash proceeds of million  as discussed above 
during  we anticipate spending approximately million in capital expenditures to complete our capital improvement and reinvestment plan  including our historical of hotel revenues to cover routine capital expenditures

we have variable rate demand notes that are highly liquid short term investments included as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
for comparative purposes  we reclassified million from cash and cash equivalents to investments as of december  in addition  we made adjustments to the consolidated statement of cash flow for the year ended december   to reflect the net purchases and sales as investing activities 
as a result  cash provided by investing activities decreased by million from the level reported in during  net use of these securities totaled million

net financing activities in used cash of million  including the repayment of million borrowed during the year and million in scheduled principal repayments 
in addition to repaying million of principal due under the established terms of our debt agreements  we reduced our long term liabilities by million through the repayment of million of debentures  as mandated by the terms of the underlying trust agreement  in connection with the may common stock offering  defeasance of million of secured debt  million of debt payments without penalty  and forgiveness of million related to an incentive achieved for meeting development targets in connection with the renovation and expansion of a hotel

to retire the debentures  we paid a premium of million  which is included on our consolidated statements of operations as a component of expense of early extinguishment of debt 
in september  we secured a new million credit facility intended to increase our working capital flexibility and allow us to react quickly to acquisition and other hotel related investment opportunities 
through the date of the new credit facility  we maintained a revolving credit facility with a separate lender that has been terminated 
subject to certain conditions  including the provision of additional collateral acceptable to the lenders  the size of the new facility may be increased at our request to up to million 
the facility matures in september  with the right to extend for two additional one year terms 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures  for working capital and for other corporate purposes 
the credit agreement requires us to comply with certain customary financial and non financial covenants  the most restrictive of which are financial covenants dealing with leverage  interest coverage and debt service coverage 
through december   there have been no borrowings under the credit facility and we were in compliance

table of contents seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
significant portions of our revenues and profits are realized from may through october 
inflation the effect of inflation  as measured by fluctuations in the us consumer price index  has not had a material impact on our revenues or net income during the periods under review 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we consider a critical accounting policy to be one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  however  we have identified our most critical accounting policies and estimates below 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
revenue recognition and receivables revenue is generally recognized as services are provided 
when we receive payment from customers before our services have been performed  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the service has been completed 
we recognize revenue from the following sources hotels room rental and food and beverage sales from owned and leased hotels 
revenues are recognized when our services have been performed  generally at the time of the hotel stay or guest s visit to the restaurant 
this treatment is consistent with others within our industry 
our revenues are significantly impacted by global  national and regional economic conditions affecting the travel and hospitality industry  as well as the relative market share of our hotels compared with our competitors 
franchise and management fees received in connection with the franchise of our brand names and management fees we earn from managing third party owned hotels 
franchise and management revenues are recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the franchise or management agreements 
entertainment computerized event ticketing services and promotion of broadway style shows and other special events 
where we act as an agent and receive a net fee or commission  it is recognized as revenue in the period the services are performed 
when we are the promoter of an event and are at risk for the production  revenues and expenses are recorded in the period of the event performance 
we review the ability to collect individual accounts receivable on a routine basis 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and amounts that are past due beyond a certain date 
the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection attempts fail 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is impacted by  among other things  national and regional economic conditions 
long lived assets property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires us to make judgments regarding estimated future cash flows from the respective properties  which is dependent upon internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which our cash flows will occur  the determination of real estate and prevailing market values  
table of contents asset appraisals and  if available and appropriate  current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers or net sales proceeds from previous  comparable transactions 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets  the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets annually or more frequently as events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
changes to our plans  including a decision to sell  dispose of or change the intended use of an asset  could have a material impact on the carrying value of the asset 
during and  we recognized impairment losses before the effect of income taxes of approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of our decision to sell certain assets discussed previously 
no impairment losses were recognized in assets held for sale we account for assets held for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their historical carrying value or market value 
revenues earned and recorded expenses associated with the operations of the properties held for sale prior to the sale date are recorded in discontinued operations  unless we anticipate continuing involvement after the sale 
depreciation is suspended when the asset is determined to be held for sale 
the real estate market  including the market for our hotels  is affected by many factors beyond our control and our ability to sell an asset in response to changing economic  financial or investment conditions is limited 
once we have made the decision to sell one or more of our assets  we may be unable to do so or  even if we are successful  it may take us longer than anticipated to find willing purchasers or the sale may be on less favorable terms 
if an asset is ultimately not sold within the guidelines of sfas no 
 depreciation would be recaptured for the period the asset was classified as held for sale 
in addition  if an asset held for sale is not ultimately sold  our review of its carrying value may result in a possible impairment based on its estimated fair market value 
intangible assets our intangible assets include brands and goodwill  which we account for in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we do not amortize our brands and goodwill 
instead  we test for impairment annually or more frequently as events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  subject to the same general assumptions discussed above for long lived assets 
at december  and  our recorded goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization remained unchanged at million 
while we have not recognized an impairment loss since we originally recorded goodwill  changes in our estimates and assumptions could affect  potentially materially  our financial condition or results of operations in the future 
our other intangible assets include management  marketing and lease contracts  the value of which is amortized on a straight line basis over the weighted average life of the agreements and totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and the assessment of these contracts requires us to make certain judgments  including estimated future cash flow from the applicable properties

fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by establishing minimum standards for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under the requirements of fin  a company must review all of its uncertain tax positions and make a determination as to whether its position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by regulatory authorities 
if a position meets the more likely than not criterion  then the related tax benefit is measured based on the cumulative probability analysis of the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement

sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged and the new measurement criteria are generally to be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fas on our consolidated financial statements
