in its brachytherapy seed business  the company produces  markets and sells theraseed  its premier palladium prostate cancer treatment device  i seed  its iodine based prostate cancer treatment device  and other related products and services 
theragenics is the world s largest producer of palladium  the radioactive isotope that supplies the therapeutic radiation for its theraseed device 
physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers  primarily located in the united states  utilize the theraseed device 
the majority of theraseed sales are channeled through third party distributors 
the company also sells its theraseed and i seed devices directly to physicians 
the company s surgical products business consists of wound closure and vascular access products 
wound closure includes sutures  needles and other surgical products with applications in  among other areas  urology  veterinary  cardiology  orthopedics  plastic surgery and dental 
vascular access includes introducers and guidewires used in the interventional radiology  interventional cardiology and vascular surgery markets 
the company has substantially diversified its operations and revenues in recent years 
prior to  the company s sole product was the palladium theraseed prostate cancer treatment device 
in  the company began to market an iodine based i seed prostate cancer treatment product 
in may  the company expanded into the surgical products business with the acquisition of cp medical corporation cp medical  followed by the acquisition of galt medical corp 
galt in august cp medical and galt comprise the company s surgical products business  which accounted for of consolidated revenue in  and of consolidated revenue in the fourth quarter of prior to may  the brachytherapy seed business constituted of the company s revenue 
cp medical was acquired on may   for million  including million in cash and the issuance of common shares valued at million 
galt was acquired on august   for million net of million of cash acquired  including million in cash and the issuance of common shares valued at million 
the company borrowed million under its million credit facility in connection with the galt acquisition 
the company s consolidated results of operations include the results of cp medical and galt subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition 
during the third quarter of a plan to restructure the company was implemented 
this plan was announced on august  see restructuring below 
restructuring the company implemented a restructuring of the brachytherapy segment in august that resulted in the closure of the plasma separation process psp facility in oak ridge  tennessee  ended the research and development activities related to the use of palladium in the vascular  macular degeneration and breast cancer areas  and eliminated production of radiochemical products the restructuring 
curtailing these activities allowed the company to shrink its asset base by shutting down six cyclotrons  closing the newton terrace facility in buford  georgia  and closing the psp facility 
the objective of the restructuring was to sharpen the company s focus on its two main business segments  brachytherapy seeds and surgical products  as well as provide a more focused platform for continued diversification and expansion through acquisitions or other channels 
as a result  restructuring charges of approximately million were recorded in the company completed activities associated with the restructuring during restructuring costs of  in were associated with the site exit and disposal activities related to the shutting down of the oak ridge facility 
the company is actively marketing its interest in its oak ridge real estate 
assets held for sale of million are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  the restructuring generated pre tax operating expense savings in  as compared to the company s run rates prior to the restructuring  of approximately million  including cash based savings of million 
the company recognized gains on the sale of assets of  in the significant portion of these gains was in the brachytherapy business  and represented the sale of equipment idled by the restructuring 
the company was not able to sell its leasehold interest in the psp equipment due to its highly specialized use  its sensitive security classification  and its export control regulations 
as a result  the psp equipment was returned to the department of energy during results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue following is a summary of revenue by segment in thousands year ended december  change brachytherapy continuing revenue one time license fees n a total brachytherapy surgical products intersegment eliminations consolidated revenue in the periods includes  of one time license fee revenue in the brachytherapy business related to the license of the company s therasphere product 
under the terms of the license agreement  this one time fee was due upon the licensee receiving the ce mark and european registration for therasphere in certain european countries  which was recorded in the third quarter 
the licensing agreement provides for continuing fees from european and us product sales of therasphere  though continuing license fees are not expected to be significant in the near future 
other increases in revenue in the periods were a result of increases in the surgical products segment 
includes revenue from galt  which was acquired in august  and a full year of operations of cp medical  which was acquired in may excluding the one time license fee revenue  brachytherapy sales decreased in from this decrease primarily reflects softness in sales to our main distributor  which decreased in decreases from the loss of another distributor in late were partially offset by increases in direct sales during the the company maintains its own internal brachytherapy sales force that sells theraseed and i seed directly to hospitals and physicians 
direct sales increased from of brachytherapy product revenue in to in the average selling price of the theraseed device during was comparable to the company has two non exclusive distribution agreements in place for the distribution of the theraseed device 
the primary distribution agreement is with c 
r 
bard bard  which is effective through december  the bard agreement 
sales to bard represented approximately of brachytherapy product revenue in the terms of the bard agreement provide for automatic one year extensions of the term  unless either party gives notice of its intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the current term 
the current term expires on december   and will be automatically extended for one additional year unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend by december  the company also has a non exclusive distribution agreement in place with a second distributor  though revenue generated from the second distributor was not material in and is not expected to be material in prior to  the company also had a non exclusive distribution agreement in place with oncura  currently a part of ge healthcare the oncura agreement 
in december  oncura notified the company that it would not be renewing its distribution agreement effective december  and subsequently  the oncura agreement was terminated effective september  in recognition of competitive marketplace pressures and new distributor strategies  the company reduced the per unit transfer price under which it sells its theraseed device to its distributors by  effective february  a reduction in transfer price will reduce gross margins on sales to these distributors at a fixed level of unit volumes 
however  manufacturing costs in the company s brachytherapy segment contains a significant fixed cost component 
accordingly  any appreciable increases in sales unit volumes to distributors could have the impact of increasing overall gross margins 
therefore  the effect of a pricing reduction to distributors on gross margins and profitability is ultimately dependent upon the performance of the company s distributors  and their ability to increase unit volumes 
in addition to the impact of the disappointing performance by our largest distributor and the termination of the oncura agreement  management believes that the brachytherapy industry continues to be affected by competition from alternative therapies  declining prices for iodine and palladium seeds  competitors selling tactics and the effects of consolidation in the industry 
potential future medicare reimbursement policies can also continue to affect the brachytherapy market 
in december congress enacted the tax relief and healthcare act of the act  which retains the pass through status of reimbursement for brachytherapy seeds for  and requires that a separate reimbursement code be established for stranded seeds 
stranded seeds are becoming a larger portion of the company s brachytherapy business 
the company believes that fixed reimbursement rates for seeds will be implemented beginning in  see medicare developments below and that this and other factors can be expected to lead to continued pricing pressure from hospitals and other health care providers 
accordingly  theragenics and or its non exclusive distributors may continue to change their respective pricing policies for the theraseed device and theragenics may change its pricing policy with respect to i seed in order to take advantage of market opportunities or respond to competitive situations 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations could have an adverse effect on average selling prices 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations can also have could have a favorable effect or prevent an unfavorable effect on market share and volumes 
conversely  the company or its non exclusive distributors could individually and independently decide to maintain per unit pricing under certain competitive situations that could adversely affect current or potential market share and volumes 
operating income and costs and expenses following is a summary of operating income by segment in thousands year ended december  change brachytherapy operating income loss one time license fees restructuring related items other severance brachytherapy excluding special items surgical products intersegment eliminations operating income loss consolidated consolidated excluding special items operating income excluding special items is a non gaap financial measure used by management in its analysis of the company s operating performance 
because of the significance of the restructuring  the one time license fee revenue  and the other severance costs  we believe presentation of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provides supplemental information that is helpful to an understanding of the operating results of the company s businesses and period to period comparisons of performance 
non gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the company s reported gaap results 
operating income excluding special items in the brachytherapy segment improved in primarily due to cost savings generated from the restructuring  which significantly reduced costs of manufacturing and research and development 
gross margins on product sales in the brachytherapy business were in  with costs of manufacturing totaling million 
gross margins in the brachytherapy seed business are dependent on sales levels  due to the high fixed cost component of the business 
the cost of manufacturing expenses experienced in is representative of what management expects going forward 
brachytherapy operating income before special items in also improved from as a result of a reduction in direct to consumer activities  decreases in advertising  and decreases in legal expenses 
operating income in the surgical products segment increased by  in over  reflecting the acquisition of galt in august  and the inclusion of cp medical for the entire year in gross margins in the surgical products business were in  with costs of manufacturing totaling million 
as a component of gross margin  costs of manufacturing included  of non cash charges related to the purchase accounting for galt that will not recur in another  of non cash charges were included in selling  general  and administrative expenses related to galt purchase accounting that will not recur in operating income for also reflected higher personnel and other costs to support increased capacity and anticipated future growth  and higher professional fees resulting from sarbanes oxley related compliance costs 
the company expects to continue to invest in infrastructure to support growth in its surgical products business 
research and development expenses declined significantly in the brachytherapy business in due to the restructuring and the discontinuance of the clinical trials and research programs underway at the time the restructuring was implemented 
looking forward  the only activity expected for these programs is the follow up of all patients previously treated in the brachytherapy related clinical trials in accordance with the fda approved protocol for those trials 
in the first quarter of the company contracted with peter j 
fitzgerald  md to serve as its chief medical director 
dr 
fitzgerald will consult with the company to identify opportunities  and advise on research and product development in the interventional cardiology  interventional radiology and wound closure markets 
research and development expenses may increase significantly in future periods over the levels as investments are made in product development to address growth opportunities in the surgical products business 
other income expense interest income was comparable between the and periods 
higher interest rates and yields were offset by a decrease in invested funds due to cash used for the cp medical and galt acquisitions 
the company s investments consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality corporate and municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
funds available for investment have and will continue to be utilized for the company s current and future expansion programs and strategic opportunities for growth and diversification 
as funds continue to be used for these programs and activities  and as interest rates continue to change  management expects interest income to fluctuate accordingly 
interest and financing costs increased from  in to  in the increase is a result of the million in borrowings under the company s million credit facility in august interest on outstanding borrowings is payable at libor plus  which was an effective rate of at december  the company expects to maintain borrowings under its credit facility to provide flexibility for future strategic initiatives and diversification 
accordingly  interest expense is expected to increase in future periods due to these outstanding borrowings and as a result of any future borrowings to support expansion programs and strategic opportunities for growth and diversification 
interest expense will also be impacted by increases or decreases in the effective interest rate on the borrowings 
income tax benefit the company recognized an income tax benefit of million in this net benefit was a result of recognizing income tax expense of million  offset by a benefit resulting from the release of million of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the fourth quarter 
mainly as a result of the restructuring  the company had operating loss carryforwards and other future deductible temporary differences that resulted in a net deferred tax asset of million at december  because of the recent history of operating losses  the uncertainty of projecting future taxable income sufficient to recognize these deferred tax assets  and management s belief that the company had to establish a track record of returning to sustained profitability  a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset was recorded at that time 
in the third quarter of  million of deferred income tax liability arising from fair value adjustments in purchase accounting related to the acquisition of galt were recorded as a reduction of the allowance for the net deferred tax asset and a reduction in the goodwill arising from the transaction 
several events occurred in the fourth quarter of  indicating to management that the company had sufficiently demonstrated a track record of sustained profitability  and management concluded that it was more likely than not that the significant portion of the deferred tax asset would be realized 
management considered  among other things  the following factors the fourth quarter was the company s fourth consecutive quarter of profitability  marking the first time since where the company was profitable in all four quarters of a fiscal year  the cost savings recognized from the restructuring exceeded expectations after a full fiscal year of operations  the tax relief and health care act of was passed by congress and became law in december  which provided important safeguards to protect reimbursement for brachytherapy seeds  as well as addressed some longer term reimbursement issues and eliminated some of the market uncertainty in brachytherapy  and the growth and performance of the surgical products segment further diversified the entire business  with of fourth quarter revenue generated by the surgical products segment 
based on these and other factors  million of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance out of a total remaining allowance of million was released in the remaining allowance of  relates primarily to certain state net operating loss carryforwards for which the company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit will not be realized 
beginning in  the company expects to report income as being fully taxed at rates of approximately to 
however  actual future tax rates can be affected by  among other things  changes in tax regulations  changes in tax rates  changes in the tax jurisdictions in which the company must file income tax returns  and many other items that affect the taxability and deductibility of the company s revenue and expenses and for which we cannot currently predict 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  consolidated revenue for the year ended december  was million  consisting of sales in the brachytherapy seed segment of million and sales in the surgical products business of million 
this represents an increase of million  or  over revenue in  and an increase in brachytherapy seed revenue of million  or over the average selling price of the theraseed device during was comparable to the average selling price during management believes that the increases in brachytherapy revenue were a result of the efforts of the company s direct sales force and its direct to consumer advertising programs 
in addition to direct brachytherapy sales  the company sold through two distributors in the company distributed through bard under an agreement that was in place for all of the company also distributed through oncura  currently a part of ge healthcare the oncura agreement 
in december  oncura notified the company that it would not be renewing its distribution agreement effective december  and subsequently  the oncura agreement was terminated effective september  sales to oncura during the year ended december  declined by compared to licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments for the company s therasphere technology 
cost of sales was million during  resulting in a gross profit margin of  compared with cost of sales of million and a gross profit margin of during included in cost of sales for the year ended december  was million of cost of sales associated with the surgical products segment 
the decreased gross margin during was due primarily to a decrease of million in the amount of palladium material produced and used to support research and development efforts during compared to the fixed costs associated with the million in palladium charged to r d in remained in cost of sales during additionally  million of production costs were capitalized during associated with the first production of palladium material using the psp technology at the company s oak ridge  tennessee facility 
as a result of the cessation of production of palladium during the fourth quarter of  no oak ridge production costs were capitalized during the gross margin in was positively impacted by approximately million of manufacturing related cost savings resulting from the restructuring  plus the increased revenue during selling  general and administrative expenses were million during  compared to million during  an increase of million 
this increase resulted from approximately million of sg a in the surgical products business  plus approximately million of severance related expenses not associated with the restructuring 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in advertising 
research and development expense decreased to million during  from million in the company was previously conducting clinical trials related to the use of palladium for the prevention of restenosis the therap trial  and clinical trials related to the use of palladium to treat exudative wet age related macular degeneration the therasight trial 
the decrease in r d expense during was primarily attributable to the completion of the therap trial during the second quarter of and curtailment of the therasight trial 
in connection with the recent restructuring  all activities related to the therap trial have been discontinued  and activities related to the therasight trial have been curtailed 
other income  comprising interest income and non operating expenses  was million during  compared to million in interest income in was impacted by higher interest rates and improved returns compared to  offset by less invested funds due to cash used in the acquisition of cp medical 
the company s investments consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality corporate and municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
the company s effective income tax rate was a benefit of during  compared to a benefit of during primarily as a result of the restructuring charges incurred during the third quarter of  the company had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million at december  the recent history of operating losses incurred by the company resulted in a valuation allowance recorded for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets at december   reducing the income tax benefit recognized in the periods 
the company s income tax rate in each period also differed from statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits related to research activities and tax exempt interest income 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of theragenics corporation are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies  which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  include the following property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
the company s estimates can result in differences from the actual useful lives of certain assets 
the significant portion of equipment is comprised of the company s cyclotrons  utilized in the brachytherapy business 
as of december   the company owned and operated eight cyclotrons  the first of which entered service in each of the company s cyclotrons is depreciated using an estimated year life 
management s estimate of the useful life of these cyclotrons is based on the company s experience to date with these cyclotrons 
based on experience gained relative to the operation  refurbishment  and maintenance of the cyclotrons  management believes there is a substantive basis for the current depreciable lives of the cyclotrons 
management will continue to periodically examine estimates used for depreciation for reasonableness 
if the company determines that the useful life of property  plant or equipment should be shortened or lengthened  depreciation expense would be adjusted accordingly for the remaining useful lives of the identified assets 
management assesses the impairment of its depreciable assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
in the event the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the estimation of fair value  whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale  also involves judgment 
during the third quarter of the company recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to the psp facility  the newton terrace facility  six cyclotrons and other related long lived assets 
this impairment charge reflects the excess of these assets carrying value over their fair value as a result of the restructuring actions taken during the third quarter of see restructuring above 
it is possible that management s estimates concerning the realizability of the company s depreciable assets or assets held for sale could change in the future 
goodwill 
the company has million of goodwill associated with its surgical products business and million of goodwill associated with its brachytherapy business 
the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if book value exceeds fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for this step the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
the company performs an annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter 
management also makes judgments about goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
the timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our statements of income in the current reporting period that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  management typically makes various assumptions about the future prospects for the reporting unit that the asset relates to  considers market factors specific to that reporting unit and estimates future cash flows to be generated by that reporting unit 
assumptions used in these assessments are consistent with the company s internal planning 
the most recent assessment was performed in the fourth quarter of and the company determined that goodwill was not impaired 
intangible assets with definite lives are being amortized  and this amortization is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns 
management judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of our accounts receivable balances may become uncollectible or subject to return 
accounts receivable are reduced by this allowance 
specifically  management analyzes accounts receivable in relation to current economic trends  changes in our customer payment history  and changes in sales returns history in establishing this allowance 
the accounts receivable balance  net of the provision for trade accounts receivables allowance of  was approximately million as of december  share based compensation 
in february  the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the issuance of  performance restricted stock units to executive officers  which vest on december  the performance restricted stock units 
the number of common shares issuable upon vesting of the performance restricted stock units is subject to a minimum of  shares and a maximum of  shares  and will be partly based on the company s revenue and earnings per share from to  relative to its strategic objectives over the same period  and partly based on the subjective discretion of the compensation committee 
the grant date fair value of the performance restricted stock units was based on the fair value of the underlying common stock and is recognized over the three year requisite service period 
for the portion of the performance restricted stock units containing performance conditions  the grant date fair value is adjusted each period for the number of shares ultimately expected to be issued 
for the portion of the performance restricted stock units subject to discretionary performance conditions  the grant date has not been established and accordingly  the fair value of the award is updated each period for changes in the fair value of the underlying common stock 
to the extent that the underlying fair value of the company s common stock varies significantly  and or the number of shares issuable is determined  the company may record additional compensation expense or adjust previously recognized compensation expense 
accounting for income taxes 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws and our interpretation of current tax laws 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our tax provision and our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  including the valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could differ materially from our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the company s deferred tax assets and recognizes the tax benefit only as reassessment demonstrates that they are realizable 
at such time  if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance is adjusted 
in  a million net deferred tax asset arose primarily as a result of the existence of operating losses and other deductible temporary differences related to the company s restructuring 
at that time  a valuation allowance for the entire amount of the net deferred tax asset was established due to uncertainties surrounding its realizability 
in the third quarter of  million of deferred income tax liabilities arising from fair value adjustments in purchase accounting related to the acquisition of galt were recorded as a reduction of the allowance 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined it was more likely than not that a significant portion of these deferred tax assets would be realized and released million of the valuation allowance 
factors considered by management in the fourth quarter of included  among other things  the company s performance for the year which included four consecutive quarters of profitability  a full fiscal year of realization of the cost savings associated with the restructuring which exceeded the expected cost savings  certain changes in federal laws and policies occurring in december related to medicare reimbursement of brachytherapy seeds  and the continued successful diversification of the company s business through its surgical products segment 
the remaining allowance of  relates primarily to certain state net operating loss carryforwards for which the company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit will not be realized 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for the valuation allowance each reporting period 
in the future if  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the company s ability to generate adequate future taxable income  it becomes more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  the valuation allowance may be required to be increased

medicare developments the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma  which went into effect on january   contained brachytherapy provisions requiring medicare to reimburse hospitals for each brachytherapy seed source furnished between january  to december  based on the hospital s costs for each patient calculated from the hospital s charges adjusted by the hospital s specific cost to charge ratio 
the mma also directed the us government accountability office gao to conduct a study examining future payment policies for brachytherapy seeds 
the gao published its report on july   concluding that the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  the regulatory body that sets medicare reimbursement policies  could establish separate prospective payment rates effective in for palladium brachytherapy seeds sources such as theraseed and iodine seeds sources using medicare s hospital outpatient data 
on november   cms posted a final rule with payment rates for brachytherapy seeds for medicare s hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps for calendar year the use of prospective payment rates will fix the per seed rate at which hospitals will be reimbursed 
from through  hospitals were reimbursed at the per seed purchased cost 
the company believed that cms approach to determining the reimbursement rate for brachytherapy seeds was fundamentally flawed 
for example  cms did not stratify cost data on differing seed configurations  such as loose versus stranded seeds 
accordingly  the company continued to work with policy makers in an effort to rectify the shortcomings it believed to be contained in the new cms rule 
in december  congress enacted the tax relief and health care act of  which extends and refines the medicare safeguards initially enacted by congress in for brachytherapy seeds administered in the hospital outpatient setting 
the president signed the legislation on december  the new legislation supercedes the final rule published by cms on november  by extending the current reimbursement policies for brachytherapy seeds through the end of  ensuring that the medicare program does not implement potentially restrictive caps on reimbursement during that period 
in addition  the new legislation recognizes that prostate cancer patients must have meaningful access to stranded brachytherapy seeds  which increasingly are used in clinical practice to further enhance the safety and efficacy of treatment 
the legislation establishes a permanent requirement for medicare to use separate codes for the reimbursement of stranded brachytherapy devices  beginning no later than july  stranded seeds are becoming a larger portion of theragenics brachytherapy business 
this important provision should allow reimbursement rules to recognize the value of this important clinical configuration even after the tax relief and healthcare act of requires the establishment of a separate reimbursement code for stranded seeds  and medicare will continue to reimburse hospitals at the per seed purchased cost as defined in the medicare rules during the company expects reimbursement rates for brachytherapy seeds will be fixed based on isotope beginning in if implemented in or thereafter  prospective rates can be expected to lead to an increase in pricing pressure from hospitals  which could adversely affect our brachytherapy revenue 
medicare rules governing coding of brachytherapy seeds sources and the procedures required to implant seeds are significantly influenced by public policy 
they have undergone significant changes during the past few years  are expected to undergo changes again in  and can undergo additional changes in the future 
the company believes that medicare reimbursement policies may continue to create confusion for hospitals and doctors going forward 
in that regard  management continues to closely monitor any effects of the reimbursement structure on the brachytherapy market as it continues to evaluate pricing  marketing and distribution strategies 
medicare s opps reimbursement levels for the procedures performed during prostate brachytherapy could influence the utilization of brachytherapy seeds  including the company s brachytherapy products
