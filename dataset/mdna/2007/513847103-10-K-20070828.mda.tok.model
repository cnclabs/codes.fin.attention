item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important in understanding the results of our operations for the three years in the periods ended june   and and our liquidity and capital resources as of june  and our fiscal year begins on july and ends on june unless otherwise noted  references to year pertain to our fiscal year  for example  refers to fiscal  which is the period from july  to june  in the discussion that follows  we analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in our overall business  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity and contractual obligations 
we then provide a review of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we have made  which we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  all included elsewhere in this report 
the forward looking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forward looking statements 
executive summary business overview we are primarily a manufacturer and marketer of specialty foods for the retail and foodservice markets 
we also manufacture and market candles for the food  drug and mass markets  glassware for the retail  floral  and foodservice markets  and automotive accessories for the original equipment market and aftermarket 
our operating businesses are organized in three reportable segments specialty foods  glassware and candles  and automotive 
over of the sales of each segment are made to customers in the united states 
we have seen our growth in recent years come from our specialty foods segment 
in  approximately of our consolidated net sales and effectively all of our operating income was derived from the specialty foods segment 
for perspective  in  our specialty foods segment comprised approximately and of our reported consolidated net sales and operating income  respectively 
as we focus more on opportunities presented by our specialty foods segment  we continue to review various alternatives with respect to our nonfood operations 
in  we sold substantially all of the operating assets of our automotive accessory division based in coshocton  ohio and lagrange  georgia  as well as our automotive accessory division based in wapakoneta  ohio 
we also initiated closure activities at our industrial glass operation located in lancaster  ohio 
the details of these transactions are discussed below 
similar actions may occur in the future  as we continue to review our alternatives for the remaining nonfood operations with the assistance of outside financial advisors 
should our continuing review result in additional divestitures  closures or other forms of restructuring of any of our operations  we could incur significant charges 
we believe that a prudent conclusion to our review is achievable within fiscal our strategy for growth within our specialty foods operations involves expanding our market presence within both retail and foodservice markets  developing and introducing new products  and adding additional business through complementary acquisitions 
over time  we believe our evolving  more food focused strategy will best enhance our long term shareholder value 
our goal is to continue to grow our specialty foods retail and foodservice business by leveraging the strength of our retail brands to increase current product sales and introduce new products  continuing to grow our foodservice business through the strength of our reputation in product development and quality  and pursuing acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria 

table of contents this strategy focuses our efforts on the most profitable part of our business and minimizes the amount of financial and management resources devoted to sectors that have trended toward lower growth potential and operating margins 
we view our food operations as having the potential to achieve future growth in sales and profitability due to attributes such as leading retail market positions in several branded products with a high quality perception  a broad customer base in both retail and foodservice accounts  well regarded culinary expertise among foodservice accounts  recognized leadership in foodservice product development  demonstrated experience in integrating complementary business acquisitions  and historically strong cash flow generation that supports growth opportunities 
within retail markets  our specialty foods group utilizes numerous branded products to support growth and maintain market competitiveness 
we place great emphasis on our product innovation and development efforts so as to enhance growth by providing distinctive new products meeting the evolving needs and preferences of consumers 
our foodservice sales primarily consist of products sold to restaurant chains 
we have experienced broad based growth in our foodservice sales  as we build on our strong reputation for product development and quality 
we expect that part of our growth in the specialty foods segment will result from acquisitions 
we continue to review potential acquisitions that we believe will provide good complements to our existing product lines  enhance our gross margins or offer good expansion opportunities in a manner that fits our overall goals 
consistent with our current acquisition strategy  in june  we acquired the principal assets of marshall biscuit company  inc marshall biscuit  a privately owned producer and marketer of frozen yeast rolls and biscuits based in saraland  alabama 
the purchase price was approximately million  and the transaction is discussed in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe this acquisition will complement our sister schubert s product lines  enhance existing manufacturing flexibility and provide us with future product development opportunities 
we have made substantial capital investments to support our existing food operations and future growth opportunities 
in  we began production activities at a newly constructed dressing facility located in kentucky 
since  we have invested over million in this facility 
during  we also commenced construction of an adjacent facility that will manufacture frozen yeast rolls 
this facility will require a slightly smaller total investment and began operation in early both projects will help accommodate potential future sales growth and also provide greater manufacturing efficiencies than existing facilities 
each project has generally progressed in accordance with our expectations  however  start up costs have been incurred and will likely persist into based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that total capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
summary of results the following is an overview of our consolidated operating results for the year ended june  the current and prior year results reflect the classification of the sold automotive operations as discontinued operations 
net sales for the year ended june  increased to approximately  million from the prior year total of  million 
this sales growth was driven by increased sales in the specialty foods segment 
gross margin declined to approximately million from the prior year comparable total of million 
our manufacturing costs have been influenced by higher raw material costs  especially for various key food commodities  paraffin wax  and aluminum  but energy costs were lower as compared to the prior year levels 
we were able to offset only a limited amount of the higher raw material costs through price increases implemented in we are striving to implement additional selected price increases to reduce the impact of these higher costs 
we are also working to mitigate the impact of these increased costs by other 
table of contents means  including changing various manufacturing processes  but these efforts may lag the adverse effect of the higher costs 
overall results were also affected by the funds received under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of cdsoa 
in  we received approximately million under cdsoa  as compared to million in and million in for a more detailed discussion of cdsoa  see the subcaption other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act of this md a 
income from continuing operations for the current year was approximately million or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
net of after tax loss from discontinued operations in of approximately million  or 
per diluted share  net income totaled million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in  which was net of an after tax loss from discontinued operations of approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
the current year loss from discontinued operations included approximately million  or 
per diluted share  attributable to the after tax loss on two automotive divestitures discussed below 
net income in totaled approximately million  or per diluted share  and was inclusive of after tax income from discontinued operations of approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
business divestitures closure in june  as part of our strategic alternative review of nonfood operations  we sold substantially all of the operating assets of our automotive accessory operations located in coshocton  ohio and lagrange  georgia 
the cash transaction resulted in a pretax loss of approximately million in the fourth quarter of similarly  in march  we sold substantially all of the operating assets of our automotive accessory operations located in wapakoneta  ohio 
the cash transaction resulted in a pretax gain of approximately million in the third quarter of the businesses included in both of these transactions were previously included in our automotive segment 
see further discussion of these divestitures in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have reflected the results of these divested businesses in the discontinued operations  net of tax section of the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
in march  we announced that we were closing our industrial glass operation located in lancaster  ohio 
production at the manufacturing facility was largely phased out by may  we anticipate that active business operations at this facility will cease  in all material respects  by the end of the calendar year upon the expected completion of certain sales and distribution activities 
the decision to close this operation resulted from continuing declines in volume and profitability 
we expect to incur total pretax charges in the range of to million for this closure 
the charges will include costs such as one time termination benefits and other employee benefits costs  including those related to the union defined benefit pension plan  charges for asset write offs  costs associated with disposal related activities and accelerated depreciation of certain property  plant and equipment 
in  we recorded pretax closing charges of approximately million  including million recorded in cost of sales for the write down of inventories 
the remaining charges are expected to be incurred during see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
looking forward based on current conditions  we expect to attain growth in consolidated sales during  primarily by introducing new products and expanding market presence  implementing price increases among various product lines and taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the acquisition of marshall biscuit 
we will continue to review acquisition opportunities within the specialty foods segment that are consistent with our growth strategy and represent good value 
operating margins of our continuing operations will be challenged by higher overall levels of ingredient  commodity and raw material costs 
in particular  we expect to experience increased ingredient and commodity costs in our specialty foods segment  where the general growth in ethanol production has indirectly led to many of our key ingredients and commodities approaching historically high levels 
we may also experience additional costs in connection with our start up of a new frozen yeast roll manufacturing facility 

table of contents in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
we believe that we will utilize somewhat higher levels of leverage in than in recent years 
this would likely result in higher levels of interest expense than we have incurred in each of the last three years 
we will continue to reassess our allocation of capital periodically  as well as the timing  nature and extent of our share repurchase activities  to ensure that we maintain adequate operating flexibility while providing appropriate levels of cash returns to shareholders 
review of consolidated operations segment sales mix the relative proportion of sales contributed by each of our business segments can impact a year to year comparison of the consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes the sales mix over each of the last three years segment sales mix specialty foods glassware and candles automotive expressed as a percentage of consolidated net sales  may not add to due to rounding 
net sales and gross margin year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales specialty foods glassware and candles automotive total gross margin gross margin as a percent of sales consolidated net sales reached approximately  million during  increasing as compared to prior year sales of  million  driven by growth coming from the specialty foods segment 
this segment s growth reflected higher volumes of foodservice products 
our nonfood segments faced generally lackluster market conditions for many of their products 
the consolidated sales growth achieved in relative to reflected growth coming from the specialty foods and automotive segments 
in the specialty foods segment  the increase in sales reflected internal growth  particularly in refrigerated dressings and frozen breads and rolls 
in the automotive segment  growth benefited from increased sales of aluminum tube steps 
competitive market conditions contributed to lower sales in the glassware and candles segment 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately in compared with in and in in the current year  we experienced higher raw material costs  especially for various key food commodities  paraffin wax  and aluminum  but energy costs were lower as compared to the prior year levels 
other factors influencing this fluctuation included start up costs associated with a new food manufacturing facility as well as approximately million of inventory write downs associated with the closure of our industrial glass operation 
significant influences affecting the decline in margins between and were the presence of higher levels of freight  energy and nonfood raw material costs

selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense as a percent of sales selling  general and administrative expenses for totaled approximately million and increased  as compared with the total of million  while the total had increased from the total of million 
included in these totals were recoveries of bad debt associated with the bankruptcy filing of kmart corporation totaling approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we wrote off approximately million related to this bankruptcy in selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively stable as a percentage of sales for the years ended june   and restructuring and impairment charge in  we recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of approximately million million after taxes including million recorded in cost of sales for the write down of inventories 
this charge is related to the planned closing of our industrial glass operations located in lancaster  ohio 
the charge consists of asset write offs  accelerated depreciation of certain property  plant and equipment  a pension curtailment charge  one time termination benefits and other costs 
production at the manufacturing facility was largely phased out by may  we anticipate that active business operations will effectively cease by the end of the calendar year upon the expected completion of certain sales and distribution activities 
the decision to close this operation resulted from continuing declines in volume and profitability 
the total estimated costs associated with this plant closure are expected to be between and million and include the above noted costs and other costs associated with disposal related activities 
total remaining cash expenditures are estimated to be approximately million and are expected to occur over the balance of calendar an analysis of this restructuring activity and the related liability recorded within the glassware and candles segment at june  follows accrual at accrual at june  cash june  charge outlays restructuring and impairment charge employee separation costs other costs subtotal pension curtailment charges accelerated depreciation inventory write down total restructuring and impairment charge the restructuring accrual is located in accrued liabilities at june  in  we recorded a noncash impairment charge of approximately million million after taxes related to certain glassware manufacturing equipment 
this impairment occurred due to inefficient production and a slowdown in demand for certain products associated with this equipment 

table of contents operating income year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
operating income specialty foods glassware and candles automotive corporate expenses total operating income as a percent of sales specialty foods glassware and candles automotive consolidated due to the factors discussed above  consolidated operating income for totaled approximately million  a decrease from operating income of million 
the total had increased from operating income totaling million 
see further discussion of operating results by segment following the discussion of net income below 
interest expense unlike and  we had short term borrowings during  which resulted in interest expense of less than million 
other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act we received a distribution of approximately million from the us government under cdsoa in the second quarter of  as compared to distributions of approximately million and million in the corresponding periods of and  respectively 
cdsoa  which applies to our candle operations  is intended to redress unfair dumping of imported products through cash payments to eligible affected companies 
such payments are in part dependent upon the amount of antidumping duties collected by the us government on those products 
the world trade organization has previously ruled that such payments are inconsistent with international trade rules 
in february  legislation was enacted to repeal the applicability of cdsoa to duties collected on imported products entered into the united states after september in july  the us court of international trade cit ruled unconstitutional  on first amendment grounds  cdsoa s requirement that a company that is not a petitioner must have indicated its support for an antidumping petition in order to be eligible for a distribution 
in july  the cit found the statute was severable to make all domestic producers eligible for benefits and remanded to the agencies for a determination of moneys owed to the plaintiff 
the remand is ongoing as of mid august in september  the cit  in a separate case  ruled the requirement unconstitutional on equal protection grounds  following a remand  the cit issued a final judgment in july affirming the agencies decisions on remand 
an appeal can be taken by any of the parties to that case until late september other cases challenging the constitutionality of cdsoa are pending before the cit  most of which have been assigned to a panel of three cit judges and consolidated or stayed 
we expect that the rulings of the cit  once finalized  will be appealed 
the ultimate resolution of the pending litigation  its timing and what  if any  effects the litigation will have on our receipt of future cdsoa distributions is uncertain 
in addition to the cit ruling  there are a number of factors that can affect whether we receive any cdsoa distributions and the amount of such distributions in any year 
these factors include  among other things  potential changes in the law  other ongoing or potential legal challenges to the law  the administrative operation of the law and the status of the underlying antidumping orders 

table of contents interest income and other net interest income and other for totaled approximately million as compared to million in and million in the current year decrease was primarily due to lower interest income  despite higher interest rates  as our aggregate level of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased significantly as compared to the prior year due to the extent of current and prior year share repurchases  dividend payments and capital expenditures 
income from continuing operations before income taxes as affected by the factors discussed above  including the approximately million reduction in cdsoa receipts  our income from continuing operations before income taxes for of approximately million decreased from the total of million 
the total income from continuing operations before income taxes was approximately million 
our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was  and in  and  respectively 
the rate was influenced by lower levels of tax free income than the prior two years 
the rate benefited from changes in state tax laws within ohio  an increased deduction for dividends paid to the esop plan due to the per share special dividend paid in december  and the new federal deduction created by the american jobs creation act related to domestic manufacturing activities 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations totaled approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively  as influenced by the level of cdsoa receipts 
income from continuing operations per share totaled approximately per basic and diluted share in  as compared to per basic and diluted share in and per basic and diluted share in income per share in each of the last three years has been beneficially affected by share repurchases  which have totaled approximately million over the three year period ended june  discontinued operations in  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of approximately million  net of tax  including a net after tax loss of approximately million on the sales of our automotive accessory operations located in wapakoneta  ohio  coshocton  ohio  and lagrange  georgia 
loss from discontinued operations per share totaled approximately 
per basic and diluted share in in  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  of approximately million  or

in  income from discontinued operations totaled approximately million  or 
per basic and diluted share 
net income net income for of approximately million decreased from net income of approximately million 
net income was approximately million in diluted net income per share totaled approximately  a decrease from the prior year total of 
the latter amount was lower than diluted earnings per share of 
segment review specialty foods net sales of the specialty foods segment during surpassed the record level achieved in  although operating income of approximately million decreased from the level of million 
the benefits from the higher sales volumes were offset primarily by higher ingredient costs 
net sales during totaled approximately million  a increase over the prior year total of million 
sales for increased over the total of approximately million 
the percentage of retail customer sales was approximately during compared to in and in the increased sales of the specialty foods segment during primarily reflected higher foodservice volumes 
retail channel increases occurred primarily within certain frozen product lines  particularly yeast rolls 
the demand for retail salad dressings and related products was constrained in by consumer demand for bagged salads and lettuce being adversely affected by lingering consumer concerns over food 
table of contents safety issues and pathogen contamination occurring in the first half of the fiscal year 
it is uncertain whether or not consumer demand for bagged salad and lettuce will return to normal levels during net pricing relief gained in to help offset higher material costs was not significant 
sales recorded from the marshall biscuit operations acquired in june were immaterial 
the foodservice increases in occurred broadly across many product lines and customers 
the sales increase experienced in was volume driven  although we did implement a limited level of price increases on retail product primarily benefiting the second half of the fiscal year 
among retail products  the growth was primarily in refrigerated produce dressings with new packaging and flavors introduced in  produce dips  and frozen breads and rolls 
the level of foodservice sales in benefited from the growth in several frozen products 
operating income of the specialty foods segment in totaled approximately million  an decrease from the total of million 
the level was above the level of million 
despite the higher sales volumes achieved in  operating income was adversely affected by higher ingredient costs  such as for soybean oil  dairy derived products  eggs and flour  and costs associated with plant start up and customer rollouts at the new salad dressing manufacturing facility located in kentucky 
we also experienced competitive market conditions for certain garlic bread items 
in  the benefits from the higher sales volumes  a more favorable sales mix and relatively stable ingredient costs were somewhat offset by higher freight and energy costs than in entering  the substantially higher levels of commodity costs we face are likely to adversely affect results for at least the first half of the fiscal year 
we have implemented various retail price increases during the first quarter of with the expectation that this action should help mitigate the higher costs we are experiencing 
results during may also be impacted by start up costs associated with the segment s new frozen yeast roll facility in kentucky 
segment review glassware and candles net sales of the glassware and candles segment are comprised primarily of candles and related accessories 
segment sales during totaled approximately million and increased less than compared to net sales of million 
this increase was attributable to stronger candle volumes among various accounts 
sales of glassware declined slightly  as influenced by lower sales of industrial glassware 
compared to net sales in totaling approximately million  sales decreased by 
this decrease was largely attributable to lower candle sales resulting from generally soft market demand and competitive market conditions 
overall sales of glassware also declined 
the segment s operating income totaled approximately million during  increasing from the prior year total of million 
operating income for totaled approximately million 
the results reflected improved operating performance  the benefits of new product introductions and modest gains from price increases 
the results also reflected a restructuring charge of approximately million  including million recorded in cost of sales for the write down of inventories  related to the previously announced closing of our industrial glass manufacturing facility located in lancaster  ohio 
in addition  over the last three years  a trend of progressively higher paraffin wax costs has negatively impacted margins 
operating results in were adversely affected by over million in unabsorbed pretax costs relating to an extended idling of our oklahoma glassware facility and higher natural gas costs in the first half of these negatives were offset somewhat by benefits from better production efficiencies at our oklahoma facility prior to the idling 
the operating income included a noncash impairment charge of approximately million relating to the impairment of certain glassware manufacturing equipment 
also affecting fluctuations between years was income associated with the liquidations of lifo glassware inventory acquired at substantially lower costs in prior years 
such liquidations reduced cost of sales by an insignificant amount in and approximately million in future results within this segment will be sensitive to capacity utilization rates due to the high level of fixed manufacturing costs that exist in this segment 
future results within this segment may also be affected by the consequences of our ongoing review of strategic alternatives  including possible divestitures  with respect to our nonfood operations 
segment review automotive net sales of the automotive segment during totaled approximately million  a decrease from the prior year sales level of million 
sales in increased from the sales level of approximately million achieved in current year results reflect reduced sales of aluminum light 
table of contents truck accessories due to general sluggishness in the sales of light trucks and the loss of an export program involving tube steps 
improved sales of aluminum accessories drove the growth in this segment during a large  new original equipment manufacturer oem program involving aluminum tube steps began in the first quarter of and continued to ramp up through the remainder of the year 
this program continued during this segment s sales to oems are made both directly to the oems and  to a lesser extent  indirectly through third party tier suppliers 
such sales are sensitive to the overall rate of new vehicle sales especially of light trucks  vans and sport utility vehicles  the availability of competitive alternatives and the tier suppliers ongoing ability to maintain their relationships with the oems 
additionally  the extent of pricing flexibility associated with these sales continues to be particularly limited with certain products subject to annual price reductions 
during  direct and indirect sales to oems comprised approximately of this segment s sales compared to approximately and in and  respectively 
operating income of the automotive segment totaled approximately million for  substantially lower than the prior year total of million 
operating income totaled approximately million in current year results were impacted by the lower sales volume and extent of continuing higher raw material costs  particularly for aluminum 
compared to  the segment s results benefited from the higher sales volume as partially offset by start up costs associated with the new oem program involving aluminum tube steps and higher aluminum raw material costs 
our results were also inclusive of a million gain that resulted from the sale of idle real estate 
future results within this segment and its overall effect on the company may also be affected by the consequences of our ongoing review of strategic alternatives  including possible divestitures  with respect to our nonfood operations 
liquidity and capital resources in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
our balance sheet retained fundamental financial strength during  and we ended the year with net debt defined as debt less cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at june  of less than million and shareholders equity in excess of million 
entering  we anticipate a somewhat higher level of average debt may be experienced than in recent years 
we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with several commercial banks totaling million 
terms of the related agreement allow for borrowings to occur at or below the us prime rate of interest 
we expect to enter into negotiation on terms for a new and possibly larger bank credit agreement during as the existing facility expires in february there is no assurance that the terms of such an agreement may be as favorable as those we currently have 
at june   we had short term borrowings of million outstanding under the existing credit facility 
we did not have any borrowings outstanding as of june  or we believe that internally generated funds  the existing credit facility and an ability to obtain additional financing  combined with the current cash and cash equivalents on hand  will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund future foreseeable capital needs 
cash flows from continuing operations year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
provided by operating activities used in investing activities used in financing activities our cash flows for the years through are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the current and prior year balance sheet and cash flows reflect the classification of the sold automotive operations as discontinued operations 
cash flow generated from operations remains the primary source of financing for our internal growth 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations 
table of contents in totaled approximately million  a decrease of as compared with the prior year total of million  which decreased from the total of million 
the decrease results primarily from our reduced level of income from continuing operations partially offset by comparatively favorable relative changes in working capital components  especially accounts receivable and accounts payable 
the decrease resulted mainly from the decline in income from continuing operations  increased pension payments and relative changes in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the current year increase in cash used for investing activities reflects million paid for the acquisition of marshall biscuit in june  which was partially offset by approximately million in proceeds from the sale of discontinued businesses and a slight reduction in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures totaled approximately million in  compared to million in and million in capital expenditures were higher in and as compared to historical levels due to the construction of a new salad dressing facility during these years as well as a new frozen yeast roll facility in production at the new frozen yeast roll facility began in early capital spending allocations during by segment approximated for specialty foods  for glassware and candles and for automotive 
based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that total capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
financing activities used net cash totaling approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily due to decreased dividend payments  proceeds from short term borrowings and lower share repurchases offset somewhat by the comparative change in cash overdraft balances 
prior year dividend payments included a special cash dividend of per common share in the second quarter 
the total payment for cash dividends for the year ended june  was approximately million 
the dividend payout rate for was per share as compared to per share during  excluding the special dividend  and 
per share in this past fiscal year marked the th consecutive year in which our dividend rate was increased 
cash utilized for share repurchases totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our board approved a share repurchase authorization of  shares in may approximately  shares from this authorization remained authorized for future purchase at june  in august  our board approved an additional share repurchase authorization of  shares 
on february   pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program  we purchased  shares of common stock from the estate of dorothy b 
fox the estate at a price per share of  which was equal to the average closing price of our common stock over the eight trading days beginning february  robert l 
fox  one of our directors  serves as executor of the estate 
on march   pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program  we had also purchased  shares of common stock from the estate at a price per share of  which was equal to the average closing price of our common stock over the ten trading days beginning february   as adjusted to reflect the effects of our previously declared dividend 
the future levels of share repurchases and declared dividends are subject to the periodic review of our board and are generally determined after an assessment is made of such factors as anticipated earnings levels  cash flow requirements and general business conditions 
our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance and  upon occasion  remediation 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material 
we are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
except as discussed above  we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect our results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
we have various contractual obligations  which are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain other items  such as purchase obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of items not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of june  and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of june  in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum required pension contributions other long term liabilities as reflected on consolidated balance sheet total operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
purchase obligations represent purchase orders and longer term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients  supplies  raw materials  and property  plant and equipment 
this amount does not include approximately million of other noncurrent liabilities recorded on the balance sheet  which consist of the underfunded pension liability  other post employment benefit obligations  and deferred compensation and interest on deferred compensation 
these items are excluded  as it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
impact of inflation our manufacturing costs during were influenced by higher raw material costs  especially for various key food commodities  paraffin wax and aluminum  but energy costs were lower as compared to the prior year levels 
other than for food commodities  our raw material costs during were generally above levels 
among raw materials most affected by the increase were certain metals  petroleum derived materials and natural gas 
material cost increases especially affected the results of the automotive segment 
we are seeing a trend toward markedly higher food commodity costs  such as soybean oil  dairy derived products  eggs and flour  and we expect these costs will be above levels in we generally attempt to adjust our selling prices to offset the effects of increased raw material costs  but these adjustments are often difficult to implement 
if implemented  such adjustments tend to lag the increase in costs incurred 
we also attempt to minimize the exposure to increased costs through our ongoing efforts to achieve greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies through the improvement of work processes 
historically  our diversity of operations also has helped minimize our exposure to some raw material costs 
as we focus more on our food operations  however  our results of operations may become more sensitive to increased prices in food commodities 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  marketing and distribution costs  asset impairments and self insurance reserves 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
while a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in part ii  item of this form k  we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize net sales and related cost of sales at the time of shipment of the products  or at the time when all substantial risks of ownership change  if later 
net sales are recorded net of estimated sales discounts  returns and certain sales incentives  including coupons and rebates 
receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write off experience and on going reviews of our trade receivables 
measurement of potential losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships  consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers 
in addition to credit concerns  we also evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for customer deductions considering several factors including historical losses and existing customer relationships 
valuation of inventory when necessary  we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for our products 
the estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of our products 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact our evaluation of our excess and obsolete inventories 
such estimates may differ from actual due to such factors as changes in customer demand and production schedules 
long lived assets we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets by periodically considering whether or not indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine if the assets are recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to the assets carrying amount 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
if the carrying amounts are greater  then the assets are not recoverable 
in that instance  we compare the carrying amounts to the fair value to determine the amount of the impairment to be recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized 
it is evaluated annually  at april  through asset impairment assessments as appropriate 
intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal  or other means are amortized over their useful lives 
we periodically evaluate the future economic benefit of the recorded goodwill and 
table of contents intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate potential recoverability concerns 
this evaluation is based on consideration of expected future undiscounted cash flows and other operating factors 
carrying amounts are adjusted appropriately when determined to have been impaired 
accrued marketing and distribution various marketing programs are offered to customers to reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to our products 
additionally  we often incur various costs associated with shipping products to the customer 
we provide accruals for the costs of marketing and distribution based on historical information as may be modified by estimates of actual costs incurred 
actual costs may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs  changes in customer utilization practices  or other conditions differ from expectations 
accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on historical loss development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to determine our ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans  we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works 
to record the related net assets and obligation of such benefit plans  we use assumptions related to inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
to determine the discount rate  we  along with our third party actuaries  considered several factors  including the june  rates of various bond indices  such as the moody s aa long term bond index  yield curve analysis results from our actuaries based on expected cash flows of our plans  and the past history of discount rates used for the plan valuation 
these assumptions follow the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we  along with our third party actuaries  review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expense and related funding requirements 
with our adoption of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
we will recognize changes in that funded status through comprehensive income in future fiscal years 
as most of our defined benefit plans and post employment obligations relate to our nonfood operations that are subject to our ongoing review of strategic alternatives  we may also experience future plan settlements or curtailments associated with divestitures or plant closings  which could have unanticipated effects on operating results 
recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas

table of contents in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
in addition  fin requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes and is effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  july  upon adoption  we currently estimate that a cumulative after tax effect adjustment of approximately million to million will be charged to retained earnings to increase our tax contingency reserves for uncertain tax positions 
this estimate is subject to revision as we complete our analysis 
recently adopted accounting standards in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year financial statements are materially misstated 
sab permits registrants to record the cumulative effect of initial adoption by recording the necessary adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings if material 
we adopted sab as of june  and noted no material impact on our financial position or results of operations as a result of the adoption

forward looking statements we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra 
this annual report on form k contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra and other applicable securities laws 
such statements can be identified by the use of the forward looking words anticipate  estimate  project  believe  intend  plan  expect  hope  or similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  contain projections regarding future developments  operations or financial conditions  or state other forward looking information 
such statements are based upon assumptions and assessments made by us in light of our experience and perception of historical trends  current conditions  expected future developments  and other factors we believe to be appropriate 
these forward looking statements involve various important risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
actual results may differ as a result of factors over which we have no  or limited  control including the strength of the economy  slower than anticipated sales growth  the extent of operational efficiencies achieved  the success of new product introductions  price and product competition  and increases in energy and raw material costs 
management believes these forward looking statements to be reasonable  however  undue reliance should not be placed on such statements that are based on current expectations 
we undertake no obligation to update such forward looking statements 
specific influences relating to these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to the potential for loss of larger programs or key customer relationships  the effect of consolidation of customers within key market channels  the continued solvency of key customers  the success and cost of new product development efforts  the lack of market acceptance of new products  the reaction of customers or consumers to the effect of price increases we may implement  changes in demand for our products  which may result from loss of brand reputation or customer goodwill

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents all have maturities of days or less 
our short term investments have interest reset periods of days or less 
these financial instruments may be subject to interest rate risk through lost income should interest rates increase during their limited term to maturity or resetting of interest rates 
as of june   there was million in short term bank loans but no long term debt outstanding 
future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and be subject to interest rate risk 
at current borrowing levels  we do not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial position
