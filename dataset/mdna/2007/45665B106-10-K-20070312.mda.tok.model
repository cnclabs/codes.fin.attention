item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview financially  was a difficult year for us as revenues declined and we were not able to meet our goal of returning to operating profitability 
our reported gross margins improved over eight points to for from in  but our revenues decreased approximately finishing the year at million compared to million in new products with higher gross margins  lower warranty costs  reductions in freight and inventory handling costs and other supply chain efficiencies contributed to the improved gross margins for the year 
we were successful in reducing our operating expenses during  posting a total reduction of million in sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses combined in compared to the reductions in our cost structure reflect the actions we initiated beginning in september as we launched a comprehensive restructuring plan which continued with further expense reduction actions as revenues fell below our expectations 
lower operating expenses are attributable to headcount reductions across the company and reductions in sales and marketing programs due to lower revenues 
in addition  strategic moves such as outsourcing our us call center to a lower cost offshore provider and divesting our wireless research and development program and tun contributed further to reductions in our expense run rates 
we posted an operating loss and net loss for of million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  for operating results were affected by the following in a million charge related to our audit committee investigations  included as a component of general and administrative expense  restructuring charges of million as further detailed below  regulatory assessments of million as further detailed below  costs related to smt of million  included as a component of other income expense  as further detailed below  impairment charge of million related to the write down of tun assets  million of which was included as a component of other income expense and million of which was included as a component of cost of revenues  write down of cost based investments in technology companies of million  included as a component of other income expense  gain on the sale of land of million  included as a component of other income expense  and income related to profits of motif of million  included as a component of other income expense 
in october  we announced that our board of directors is conducting an ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives to improve shareholder value and that banc of america securities is engaged as our financial advisor to assist the board in its evaluation 
in addition  in a series of filings with the sec beginning shortly after this announcement  our largest shareholder  caxton associates llp caxton  stated their intent to call a special meeting of our shareholders to replace all or a portion of our board 
in february  we entered into a settlement agreement with caxton 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  caxton agreed to not pursue their plans to call a special meeting of our shareholders 
in exchange  we agreed to allow caxton the option to name up to two designees to our board if we have not announced a definitive agreement for the sale of the company or a merger or other business combination by april  if this were to occur  these caxton designees would be added to the current five members of the board 
as a result of this announcement regarding strategic alternatives  in october  we implemented retention bonus programs for our executive and non executive employees other than our chief executive officer 
the non executive retention bonus program paid a bonus to all employees who remained with the company through january   and will pay a bonus to employees who remain with us through april  the executive bonus program provides for the payment of bonuses if the operating income goals are met in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the fourth quarter goal was not met 
the total cost of the retention bonus programs is estimated to be million  million of which was recognized in the fourth quarter of results of operations year ended december  dollars in thousands dollars of revenues dollars of revenues dollars of revenues revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses marketing and sales research and development general and administrative restructuring costs impairment of long lived assets regulatory assessments loss from operations other income expense interest expense interest income other  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss percentages may not add due to rounding 
revenues revenues decreased million  or in compared to and decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease in revenue in compared to was due to the following a million decrease in engine and display revenues as we completely exited those markets in late  a decrease in oem unit sales as we continued to deemphasize our oem business in  a  unit decrease in total projector units sold to  units in compared to  units in  and a decrease in average projector selling prices asps  due to both lower overall pricing and a shift in product mix 
approximately half of the decrease in revenues in compared to was due to transitioning our rear screen projection television engine business to smt during the year 
another factor contributing to the decline in projector revenues in as compared to was the impact of our decision to deemphasize our oem projector business in as we formed smt 
in addition  projector revenues were down in compared to due to asp declines and a decline in unit shipments 
specifically  average sales prices declined in compared to and projector unit shipments were down in compared to the decrease in asps in compared to was primarily due to increased pricing pressure from our asian competitors fueled in part by excess inventory available across the industry and in all geographic locations in the first half of our asps remained relatively flat in the second half of  due to our efforts to improve gross margins by focusing on core markets and geographies and not pursuing unprofitable business 
the decline in projector unit shipments in was primarily due to the intentional de emphasis on our oem projector business 
revenues from lamps and accessories increased in compared to when revenues were hampered by an industry wide shortage of lamps 
geographic revenues revenue by geographic area and as a percentage of total revenue  based on shipment destination  was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  united states europe asia other united states revenues were down in compared to primarily due to the lack of engine and display revenues in  as well as the decreases in units and asps  as discussed above 
the decreases in units and asps in compared to reflect industry dynamics including intense competition  slower than expected adoption of front projectors by consumers  difficult product transitions that resulted in missed market opportunities  and a decline in revenues from our value added reseller channel 
while we experienced a decline in revenues in the value added reseller channel  the overall market for that channel experienced above average growth during the year 
european revenues were down in compared to primarily due to decreases in units sold and asp s 
in addition  european revenues were negatively impacted by product availability for our new main stream meeting room products as our old products in this category did not meet new european regulatory requirements which went into effect on july  our entire product line is now in compliance with these new regulations 
asian revenues were down in compared to primarily due to a decrease in units  partially due to the lack of availability of china manufactured versions of our new products earlier in  and decreases in asps 
united states revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to management decisions to not participate in certain sales opportunities due to the overly aggressive pricing competition related to competitor price buy in deals and lower revenues related to transitioning our rear projection engine business to smt 
european revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to economic softness in certain key markets as well as specific industry softness in the european region 
in addition  we experienced declines in our ask branded business and our strategic decision to transition the majority of our projector oem business to smt has negatively affected european revenues as this region s revenue base historically has benefited from oem customers 
asian revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to a strategic decision not to grow this region until we had china manufacturing facilities up and running 
in addition  the china market was very slow for us in the second half of as we worked to restructure our sales and distributor relationships 
backlog at december   we had backlog of approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  given current supply and demand estimates  it is anticipated that a majority of the current backlog will turn over by the end of the first quarter of the stated backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period  nor is a backlog any assurance that we will realize a profit from filling the orders 
gross margin we achieved gross margins of in  in and in the improvement in gross margins in compared to was due to the following efficiencies achieved within our supply chain  including the reduction of inventory in order to better match the timing of product costs with revenues  reduced warranty costs  introduction of new products with improved gross margins  greater product cost reductions  an million charge for inventory write downs and accelerated tooling depreciation during compared to a charge of million in  reductions in our overall cost to serve customers  including reductions in customer program costs  and a settlement charge related to a patent infringement case during the second quarter of  with no similar charges in the decline in gross margins in compared to was due to the following asp declines discussed above combined with other end user price promotions and programs  a million charge for inventory write downs and accelerated tooling depreciation during compared to a million charge in  a settlement charge related to a patent infringement case during the second quarter of  minimal product cost reductions as we reduced the volume of procurement from our contract manufacturers and  to a large extent  sold inventory that was purchased in prior quarters  and fixed overhead costs for activities such as logistics centers  warranty  tooling amortization and inventory planning and procurement were a higher percentage than normal as a result of lower revenues 
the charge for inventory write downs in related primarily to end of life costs for various product platforms and a decline in market value on slow moving finished goods 
the charge for inventory write downs in was primarily related to our exit from the thin display business  lower of cost or market write downs on certain remanufactured projectors  service parts and slow moving finished goods inventory  and the transition of contract manufacturing from flextronics to other contract manufacturers 
of the million of inventory and equipment write downs in  million was recorded in the third quarter and included million related to the write down of inventory and accelerated tooling depreciation associated with the discontinuance of our thin display products  million for excess component exposures related to our transition from flextronics as a contract manufacturer and million related to the write down of certain other remanufactured projectors  service parts and slow moving finished goods inventory 
the inventory write downs in related primarily to end of life costs for various product platforms  a decline in market value of the inventory held by customs in china and inventory processing transition issues associated with the movement of our us logistics and factory repair activity to ups 
the inventory write downs reduced our gross margin by percentage points in  percentage points in and percentage points in we continue to focus on improving our supply chain efficiencies in order to reduce our product costs 
specifically  we are taking the following actions working closely with our contract manufacturers to control product costs  improving supply chain efficiencies by reducing product freight  handling and storage costs  managing inventory levels down further in order to increase operating inventory turns and improve cash flow  and focusing on lower cost  higher performance products 
marketing and sales expense marketing and sales expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in the decrease in marketing and sales expense in compared to was primarily due to efficiencies gained related to our previous restructuring activities  which included reductions in payroll related costs as well as reductions in sales and marketing related travel expenses 
in addition  due to a conscious effort to reduce marketing program spending  we recognized large decreases in overall spending for sales and marketing programs  such as cooperative advertising  which directly correlate with trends in revenue 
also contributing to the decrease was a million reduction in the amount of it and facilities expenses allocated to sales and marketing 
as overall it and facilities expenses have decreased  allocations to other functional areas have decreased proportionately 
these decreases were partially offset by increased advertising expenses related to the launch of several new products and our new branding campaign 
in addition  included  of stock based compensation compared to  in the decrease in marketing and sales expense in compared to was primarily due to decreased marketing program expenses related to lower revenues and changes to programs offered in as compared to some marketing programs  such as cooperative advertising  directly correlate with trends in revenue 
when revenues are lower  the related marketing program expenses are also reduced 
in addition  some marketing dollars spent on cooperative advertising programs relate to specific product promotions and are classified accordingly as a reduction of revenues and a larger portion of these expenses were classified as a reduction of revenues  versus advertising expense  in as compared to in addition  the amount of administrative expense allocated to sales and marketing was lower in as compared to as total it and facilities expenses decreased year over year 
overall spending in sales and marketing was reduced in compared to related to conscious cost cutting initiatives 
research and development expense research and development expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in the reduction in research and development expense in compared to was primarily due to efficiencies gained through our previous restructuring activities  as well as a decrease in labor related costs resulting from a reduction in headcount related to our wireless initiatives that took place late in the second quarter of also contributing to the decrease was a million reduction in the amount of it and facilities expenses allocated to research and development 
as overall it and facilities expenses have decreased  allocations to other functional areas have decreased proportionately 
partially offsetting these reductions was  of stock based compensation in compared to no stock based compensation in the reduction in research and development expense in compared to was primarily due to expected reductions related to the formation of smt and the closure of our remaining research and development facilities in norway 
these reductions included lower labor expense  travel  consulting and non recurring engineering expenses related to product design 
in addition  the amount of administrative expenses allocated to research and development was lower in compared to as overall it and facilities expenses were reduced 
partially offsetting these decreases were slight increases in consulting expenses related to third party engineering services provided in as our engineering staff was reduced 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in  and decreased million  or  in from million in general and administrative expense in included approximately million of costs related to our audit committee investigations 
in addition  included  of stock based compensation  compared to  in bad debt expense increased million in compared to in  we had a net bad debt recovery of million compared to bad debt expense of million in other areas of increased spending included fees for tax consulting and expenses related to filing and defending patents and trademarks 
these increases were offset by efficiencies gained related to our previous restructuring activities 
these efficiencies included lower headcount costs  lower travel expenses and lower rent expense related to facility consolidations 
the decrease in compared to was related to a million reduction in bad debt expense 
the reduction in bad debt expense year over year was primarily related to the recovery in of bad debt expense booked in previous periods 
we also recognized decreases in labor costs and rent expense related to our and restructuring actions 
these decreases were partially offset by increased spending on new patents and trademarks  increased legal expenses related to various legal matters including a patent infringement suit  the china customs and ofac investigations  and increased expense related to accelerated depreciation on assets that were located at our norway facility that was shut down in the first quarter of restructuring restructuring charges totaled million in and included the following a million charge related to international facility consolidation activities that were completed during the first quarter of  an  charge in the second quarter of primarily related to our contractual obligation for severance for former infocus employees terminated by smt during the second quarter of an  charge in the third quarter of for severance costs primarily related to the decision to outsource our us call center to a third party as well as other headcount reductions initiated during the third quarter  and a million charge in the fourth quarter of for headcount reductions and for changes in estimates for prior period sub lease assumptions on facility reductions 
included in the million charge was a charge of million related to severance for former infocus employees who were terminated by smt during the fourth quarter of restructuring charges totaled million in and included the following a million charge primarily related to reductions in headcount as part of a restructuring plan that was announced in september the majority of these actions  including the elimination of several senior executive and management positions  as well as other headcount reductions  were completed over a three quarter period  a million charge in the second quarter of primarily associated with severance charges for changes in supply chain management and realignment of our european sales force  and million of charges related to our december plan of restructuring associated with streamlining our operations in fredrikstad  norway  which consisted primarily of costs to vacate space under long term lease arrangements  additional severance charges in the us and europe and non cash stock based compensation expense related to former employees who transitioned to smt 
restructuring charges totaled million in and included the following a million charge in the first quarter of for consolidating employees at our research and development  factory repair and logistics site in wilsonville  oregon into our corporate headquarters building and for the transfer of our logistics and factory repair activities to ups  and a million charge in the fourth quarter of related to streamlining our operations in fredrikstad  norway 
upon formation of a new research and development subsidiary in norway for smt  a majority of our current research and development team moved to this operation 
this charge primarily related to employee severance costs 
we anticipate restructuring charges totaling approximately million to million in the first quarter of for additional facilities related restructuring as we further consolidate our facilities globally 
at december   we had a remaining accrual for all of our past restructuring activities of million 
see further detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets held and used by us and intangible assets with determinable lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
during the third quarter of  we performed an expected present value analysis with multiple cash flow scenarios  weighted by estimated probabilities  using a risk free interest rate to estimate fair value 
this analysis indicated that the book value of our long lived assets exceeded the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
based on our analyses  we determined that all of our long lived assets  other than tooling equipment related to current products  were fully impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge totaling million in the third quarter of in order to write off the remaining book value of our long lived assets other than tooling equipment used in the production of current products 
of the million charge  million was allocated to property and equipment and million was allocated to other intangible assets  including the carrying value of patents and trademarks 
the majority of the impaired long lived assets continue to be used in operations 
regulatory assessments regulatory assessments of million in included charges totaling million related to the initial settlement of our shanghai customs case  offset by the million reversal of our remaining million accrual related to our closed office of foreign assets control case 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more details regarding regulatory assessments 
other income expense interest income in was million compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to increasing interest rates  partially offset by decreasing cash and investment balances as cash was used in operations 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increasing interest rates  as well as increasing cash and investment balances in the second half of in addition  in  we received interest related to income tax refunds from income tax filings from prior years 
other  net included the following in thousands year ended december  net realized gain on the sale of equity securities income related to the profits of motif  joint venture expense related to losses of smt  joint venture write down of equity method investment in smt  joint venture charge for estimated costs to wind down smt impairment charge related to tun gains losses related to foreign currency transactions write down of certain cost based investments in technology companies gain on sale of land other motif license fees are recognized when licensees report sales and resultant royalties  which are currently contractually required on a semi annual basis and primarily fall in the first and third quarters of each year 
the decreased income related to our motif joint venture was due to lower reported revenues by motif s licensees and an increase in tax expense as motif has now utilized the majority of its income tax loss carry forwards 
smt is currently winding down its operations  including the sale of its assets and the settlement of its liabilities 
the million charge included as a component of other  net in is our best estimate of our share of the costs for the wind down 
income taxes income tax expense of million in was made up of million and million of income tax expense from us operations and foreign operations  respectively 
the million of tax expense from us operations was the result of withholding tax on foreign royalty payments received and state income taxes net of return to provision adjustments 
the million of tax expense from foreign operations was primarily comprised of million for anticipated transfer pricing adjustments  million for adjustments to various deferred tax assets that were not offset by valuation allowances  and million net tax expense on foreign operations 
income tax benefit of million in was related to million of tax benefit from closing out foreign tax exposures in prior years and million net true up benefit from our tax provision to our actual tax returns 
these tax benefits were offset by million of tax expense in certain foreign and state tax jurisdictions and million of tax expense due to valuation allowance applied to certain foreign deferred tax assets 
income tax benefit of million in primarily related to a release of previously recorded tax reserves that were resolved in the fourth quarter of  as well as tax refunds recognized as a result of net operating loss carry backs in norway from and to  offset by tax expense in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more details concerning our income tax provision 
inflation we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal on our business in  and liquidity and capital resources total cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash were million at december  at december   we had working capital of million  which included million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
the current ratio at december  and december  was to and to  respectively 
we sustained an operating loss of million in  contributing to a decrease in net working capital of million for the year 
if we continue to experience significant operating losses and reductions in net working capital  we may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing to continue current business operations 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms  if at all 
we currently have a million line of credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc wells fargo to finance future working capital requirements 
the line of credit expires march  pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  we may borrow against the line subject to a borrowing base determined on eligible accounts receivable 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants 
we were out of compliance with one of the covenants as of december  due to our loss incurred in the fourth quarter of in february  we entered into an amendment to this facility  which waived our non compliance as of december  and amended the required financial covenant for the first quarter of as of december   we did not have any amounts outstanding under this credit agreement and we do not expect to draw upon this facility prior to its expiration 
we anticipate that our current cash and marketable securities  along with cash we anticipate generating from operations  will be sufficient to fund our known operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  to the extent our operating results fall below our expectations  we may need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings 
we may also need additional capital if we pursue other strategic growth opportunities 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms  if at all 
at december  we had one outstanding letter of credit totaling million  which expired on february  the letter of credit was subsequently amended with a new expiration date of may  this letter of credit collateralizes our obligations to a supplier for the purchase of finished goods inventory 
the fair value of this letter of credit approximates its contract value 
the letter of credit is collateralized by million of cash and marketable securities  and  as such  is reported as restricted on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the million letter of credit  the million in restricted cash and marketable securities also secures our foreign currency hedging transactions 
on january   we entered into an amendment to our security agreement with wells fargo bank that increased our collateral requirements by million in connection with required security for our merchant credit card processing account 
as a result  the amount of restricted cash reported on our balance sheet will increase by million in the first quarter of the remainder of the restricted cash  totaling million  primarily related to building lease deposits and value added tax deposits with foreign jurisdictions 
accounts receivable decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in the accounts receivable balance was primarily due to lower sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of offsetting the reduction in accounts receivable due to lower sales was an increase in days sales outstanding to days at december  compared to days at december  total inventories  including consigned inventories  decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the components of inventory as of these dates 
during  we continued to work closely with our contract manufacturers to better align incoming product levels with expected sales needs in order to allow us to reduce finished goods inventory 
service inventories  which consist of service parts held for warranty or customer repair activities  remanufactured projectors and projectors in the process of being repaired  were also significantly reduced 
in addition  we recognized million of charges in related to the write down of finished goods and service inventories 
at december  and december   we had approximately weeks and weeks of inventory  respectively  in the americas channel 
annualized inventory turns were approximately times for the quarter ended december  compared to approximately times for the quarter ended december  improved velocity in our supply chain allows us to better match current costs against current sales prices  maximizing our gross margin opportunity  reducing our total investment in working capital and reducing exposure to excess and obsolete inventory 
land held for sale of million at december  related to two plots of undeveloped land adjacent to our headquarters building in wilsonville  oregon 
on june   we sold the land  receiving net proceeds of million and recognizing a gain on the sale of million in the second quarter of other current assets decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the return of million of our shanghai customs case deposit and the remaining deposit of million was expensed in the fourth quarter of see part i  item and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding this matter 
expenditures for property and equipment totaled million in and were primarily for purchases of tooling  software upgrades  tradeshow equipment and office equipment 
total expenditures for property and equipment are expected to be between million and million in other assets decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  included in other assets are building deposits  minority interest investments in technology companies and investments in our joint ventures 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million related to the write down of two separate cost based investments  reflectivity and vst international  both start up technology companies 
the write down of million in the first quarter of effectively reduced the carrying value of these cost based investments to zero 
subsequently  reflectivity was sold at a price whereby it is unlikely we will receive any return on our investment and vst international merged its operating assets with another company and became a owner of the new combined entity 
we continue to monitor the status of both companies and will record any recovery of our investment  if any  upon receipt 
we had a recognized loss on our investment in smt during of million and  in the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge to write off the remaining value of our original investment in smt 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of million related to the write down of tun assets 
offsetting these decreases was an increase of million in our investment in motif related to our share of profits offset by a dividend payment received in the second quarter of of million 
related party accounts payable decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  and represent outstanding payables to smt for the purchase of projectors and other related expenses 
accounts payable decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease is mainly attributed to reduced inventory purchases in the second half of related to the reduction in revenues compared to the prior year and lower ending inventories 
in addition  non inventory accounts payable also declined related to reduction of spending for operating expenses in other current liabilities decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to a million decrease in our accruals related to our restructuring activities and a million reduction in value added tax payable related to our european entities 
in addition  other current liabilities decreased by million as a result of the reversal of our remaining accrual related to the ofac matter  which is now closed 
offsetting these decreases is an increase of million in unearned revenue related to the sale of extended warranty contracts 
the revenue is recognized as earned over the extended warranty period 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  was as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond letters of credit purchase order commitments operating leases the letter of credit collateralized our obligations for outstanding accounts payable and future purchase commitments to a supplier for the purchase of finished goods inventory 
seasonality given the buying patterns of various geographies and market segments  our revenues are subject to certain elements of seasonality during various portions of the year 
historically  between and of our revenues have come from europe and  as such  we typically experience a seasonal downturn due to the vacation season in mid summer  which results in decreased revenues from that region in the third quarter compared to the second quarter 
conversely  we typically experience a strong resurgence of revenue from europe in the fourth quarter 
this  coupled with a strong business and retail holiday buying season in the fourth quarter  typically leads to our strongest revenues being in the final quarter of each year 
in addition  we sell our products into the education and government markets that typically see seasonal peaks in the united states in the third quarter of each year 
the first quarter of each year is typically down from the immediately preceding fourth quarter due to corporate buying trends and typical aggressive competition from our asian competitors with march fiscal year ends 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  for additional information 
allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivables credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to initiate and modify their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
in certain situations  if an account is determined to be a bad debt  we may use collection agencies to work with the customer to receive payment in return for a fee 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
bad debt expense recovery  net totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and our allowance for uncollectible accounts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and is included on the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of accounts receivable 
see schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts  for additional information 
allowance for sales returns and other deductions from revenue some distributor  dealer and retailer agreements allow for partial return of products and or price protection under certain conditions within limited time periods 
such return rights are generally limited to a contractually defined short term stock rotation and defective or damaged product although we have granted retailers return policies consistent with the retailers return policies for their customers 
we maintain a reserve for sales returns and price adjustments based on historical experience and other qualitative factors 
we also have incentive programs for dealers and distributors whereby rebates are offered based upon exceeding volume goals 
estimated sales returns  price protection and rebates are deducted from revenue 
historical return rates are monitored on a product by product basis 
as new products are introduced  these historical rates are used to establish initial sales returns reserves and are adjusted as better information becomes available 
we also regularly monitor and track channel inventory with our significant customers 
variability in channel inventory levels from quarter to quarter is further used to qualitatively adjust our returns reserves 
typically  return rates worldwide have averaged in a relatively tight range of to of sales to customers who are granted such rights 
if a dramatic change in the rate of returns were to occur  our estimate of our sales return accrual could change significantly 
one of the factors we consider in estimating future returns  for the customers who are granted such rights  is the sell through of products by our distributors and dealers 
we have controls in place to monitor channel inventory levels with these customers 
we believe the risk of returns increases when inventory held by any particular customer exceeds their near term needs 
accordingly  we defer recognition of revenue on certain channel inventory estimated to be in excess of days 
our reserves deducted from revenues and accounts receivable for sales returns  price protection and other rebates totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and historically  our actual experience for sales returns  price protection and rebates has not differed materially from our estimates 
see schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts  for additional information 
inventory valuation we regularly evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions  as well as other factors 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
finished goods are reviewed quarterly by product marketing  sales  finance and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices 
service inventory is systematically written down based on the estimated remaining service life of the inventory 
we record write downs for inventory based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand in our analysis 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change 
at december  and  our inventory reserves totaled million and million  respectively  and was recorded as a reduction of inventory on our consolidated balance sheets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
product warranties we evaluate our obligations related to product warranties on a quarterly basis 
in general  we offer a standard two year warranty and  for certain customers  products and regions  the warranty period can be longer or shorter than two years 
we monitor failure rates on a product category basis through data collected by our manufacturing sites  factory repair centers and authorized service providers 
the service organizations also track costs to repair each unit 
costs include labor to repair the projector  replacement parts for defective items and freight costs  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
any cost recoveries from warranties offered to us by our suppliers covering defective components are also considered  as well as any cost recoveries of defective parts and material  which may be repaired at a factory repair center or through a third party 
this data is then used to calculate the accrual based on actual sales for each projector category and remaining warranty periods 
for new product introductions  our quality control department estimates the initial failure rates based on test and manufacturing data and historical experience for similar platform projectors 
if circumstances change  or a dramatic change in the failure rates were to occur  our estimate of the warranty accrual could change significantly 
revenue generated from sales of extended warranty contracts is deferred and amortized to revenue over the term of the extended warranty coverage 
deferred warranty revenue totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and and is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
our warranty accrual at december  totaled million  of which million is classified as a component of current liabilities and million is classified as other long term liabilities on our consolidated balances sheets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and nol carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is unlikely  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets

if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposure our financial market risk arises from fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates 
our net investment exposure in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates at december   was approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million at december  we currently have no formal plans of liquidating any of our foreign subsidiaries  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not affect our results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in exchange rates through the sale of products denominated in non functional foreign currencies 
our purchases of inventory are largely denominated in us dollars and we anticipate to continue purchasing in us dollars in the foreseeable future  therefore we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on these purchases 
we have established a foreign currency derivative program  utilizing foreign currency forward contracts forward contracts to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are substantially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
we do not use forward contracts as speculative instruments for trading purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in our foreign currency forward contracts would not have a material effect on our results of operations 
these forward contracts are not designated as qualifying hedges and  accordingly  are marked to market at the end of each period  with the resulting gain or loss being recorded as a component of other income or expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
the table below summarizes  by major currency  the contractual amounts of our forward exchange contracts translated to us dollars as of december  and the forward contracts outstanding as of december  mature within days of year end 
the bought amounts represent the net us dollar equivalents of commitments to purchase foreign currencies  and the sold amounts represent the net us dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies 
forward contracts outstanding were as follows at december  and in thousands bought sold foreign currency euro british pound singapore dollar swedish krona norwegian kroner net amount outstanding interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our line of credit and our investment portfolio 
our million line of credit facility with wells fargo bears interest on outstanding borrowings at prime plus  however  at no time will the interest rate be below 
during the year ended december   we did not borrow under our line of credit and  therefore  a change in the prime rate would not have had any effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we mitigate interest rate risk on our investment portfolio by diversifying investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with our investment policy 
as of december   our investment portfolio included marketable debt securities of million  exclusive of million invested in money market funds  and marketable equity securities of million 
marketable equity securities are adjusted to fair market value at the end of each period with the associated unrealized gains or losses recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the marketable debt securities are carried at amortized cost  but are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
at december   the fair market value of our marketable debt securities totaled million 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
