item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in the liquidity section in this report 
competitive conditions astronics experiences considerable competition in the aerospace market sectors we serve  principally with respect to product performance and price  from various competitors  many of which are substantially larger and have greater resources 
success in the aerospace markets we serve depends upon product innovation  customer support  responsiveness  and cost management 
astronics continues to invest in developing the technologies and engineering support critical to competing in our aerospace markets 
government contracts all us government contracts  including subcontracts where the us government is the ultimate customer  may be subject to termination at the election of the government 
raw materials materials  supplies and components are purchased from numerous sources 
we believe that the loss of any one source  although potentially disruptive in the short term  would not materially affect our operations in the long term

item a 
risk factors risks related to our industry the markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events  which may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
for example  demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors  including capital investment  product innovations  economic growth  and technology upgrades 
in addition  the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to fuel price increases  labor disputes and economic conditions 
a change in any of these factors could result in a reduction in the amount of air travel 
a reduction in air travel would reduce orders for new aircraft and reductions in cabin upgrades by airlines for which we supply products and for the sales of spare parts  thus reducing our sales 
a reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or at all 
we depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and sub contractors that may not be fully funded or may be terminated  and the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales 
sales to the us government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business 
the funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations  and congressional priorities are subject to change 
in addition  government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated 
a decline in governmental expenditures may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us 
if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations  our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted 
many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers 
there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors  including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor 
failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer 
subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
in addition  a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability 
our results of operations are affected by our fixed price contracts 
the nature of our business activities involves fixed price contracts 
our contractual arrangements include customers requirements for delivery of hardware and funded nonrecurring development work that we anticipate will lead to follow on production orders 
for the year ended december   fixed price contracts represented of our sales 
on fixed price contracts  we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price 
depending on the fixed price negotiated  these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract s fixed price 
however  we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit 
contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation  including rules related to bidding  billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims  and any non compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment 
like all government contractors  we are subject to risks associated with this contracting 
these risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties 
these fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules  employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards  receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims 
we have been  and expect to continue to be  subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies 
the failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation 
it could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts 
if we are unable to adapt to technological change  demand for our products may be reduced 
the technologies related to our products have undergone  and in the future may undergo  significant changes 
to succeed in the future  we will need to continue to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive 
furthermore  our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge 
we may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive  and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers 
our new product development efforts may not be successful  which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements  and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers 
in addition  the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates  and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs 
if any of these events occur  our sales and profits could be adversely affected 
risks related to our business our products are sold in highly competitive markets 
some of our competitors are larger  more diversified corporations and have greater financial  marketing  production and research and development resources 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors develop products that are superior to our products  develop products that are more competitively priced than our products  develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
we believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality  price  design and engineering capabilities  product development  conformity to customer specifications  quality of support after the sale  timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization 
maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing  engineering  quality standards  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
if we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments  or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position  our operations and financial performance will suffer 
a write off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth and cause us to violate covenants in our bank credit facility 
goodwill and other intangible assets are a substantial portion of our other assets 
at december   goodwill was million and other intangible assets were million  of our total assets of million 
we may have to write off all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets if their value becomes impaired 
although this write off would be a non cash charge  it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly 
a write off of goodwill or other intangible assets could also cause us to violate covenants in our bank credit facility that requires a minimum level of net worth 
this could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel 
the loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business 
in addition  competition for qualified technical personnel in our industries is intense  and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract  train and retain such personnel 
future terror attacks  war  or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business 
continued terror attacks  war or other disturbances could lead to further economic instability and decreases in demand for our products  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist attacks world wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry 
the long term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown 
these attacks and the us government s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability 
our facilities could be damaged by catastrophes which could reduce our production capacity and result in a loss of customers 
we conduct our operations in facilities located in the united states and canada 
any of these facilities could be damaged by fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunication and information systems failure or similar events 
although we carry property insurance  including business interruption insurance  our inability to meet customers schedules as a result of catastrophe may result in a loss of customers or significant additional costs 
government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the united states 
in  of our sales were subject to compliance with the united states export administration regulations 
our failure to obtain the requisite licenses  meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products outside the united states 
compliance with the government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and costs 
the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position 
in order to sell our products in european union countries  we must satisfy certain technical requirements 
if we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products  our sales in europe would be restricted 
some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties 
failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems  development schedule slides  manufacturing difficulties  or similar schedule related events could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the failure of our products may damage our reputation  necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage  thereby requiring us to pay significant damages 
defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall 
we include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products 
if any of our products are defective  we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims 
such an event could result in significant expenses  disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products 
we are also exposed to product liability claims 
we carry aircraft and non aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms 
however  this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim 
a product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of a major customer or a significant reduction in sales to a major customer would reduce our sales and earnings 
in we had a concentration of sales to a major customer representing of our sales 
the loss of this customer or a significant reduction in sales to this customer would significantly reduce our sales and earnings 
we are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the near future 
as with any new program there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market 
as is customary for our business we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer 
if a program or aircraft is not successful we may have to write off all or a part of the inventory  accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program

we operate four principal facilities located in new york state  new hampshire  washington state and quebec  canada 
we serve the three primary aircraft markets which are the military  commercial transport and the business jet markets 
in  the break down of sales to the commercial transport market  the military market and the business jet market were  and  respectively  miscellaneous sales to non aerospace markets accounted for of sales 
astronics strives to offer comprehensive lighting and electrical systems for aircraft which we believe make the company unique in our ability to serve our customers 
on february   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of the general dynamics airborne electronic systems aes business unit from a subsidiary of general dynamics 
astronics acquired the business for million in cash 
the company financed the acquisition and related costs by borrowing million on its revolving line of credit and used million of cash on hand 
during the fourth quarter of we broke ground on a  square foot expansion to our east aurora  new york facility 
the budget for the building is approximately million exclusive of manufacturing equipment which will be acquired as needed 
we expect to permanently finance the project with a tax exempt bond offering expected to close during the first half of we anticipate the construction to be completed during the second quarter of the expansion will provide additional production capacity allowing for continued growth 
key factors affecting astronics growth are our ability to have our products designed into the plans for new aircraft  the rate at which new aircraft are produced  government funding of military programs  and the rates at which aircraft owners  including commercial airlines  refurbish or install upgrades to their aircraft 
once designed into a new aircraft  the spare parts business is frequently retained by the company 
astronics strategy is to increase the amount of content on aircraft platforms  evolving the company from our historic role of a components supplier to a turn key provider of complete systems 
one of the principal markets we serve is the commercial transport market 
the acquisition of astronics aes has increased our exposure to the commercial transport market 
as the financial condition of the world s airlines improves and stabilizes  the airlines are beginning to increase investments in new aircraft purchases and cabin improvements 
many airlines are expanding the number of seats equipped with in flight entertainment systems and in seat power 
this in turn has resulted in a significant increase of sales for our cabin electronics product line 
we believe we are in a strong position to continue to benefit from this trend 
our increased exposure to this market also means we have greater down side risk should the commercial transport market enter a period of retraction as it did for several years beginning in if that were to occur  it is likely that commercial airlines would reduce spending on these types of programs and have a significant negative impact on our business 
the cabin electronics product line  which is principally sold to the commercial transport market  accounted for of our sales in and of our sales the business jet market remained strong during we provide a wide range of products to the business jet market including cockpit lighting  exterior lighting and air frame power 
our products are found in aircraft manufactured by most of the leading business jet oem s such as cessna  raytheon and  bombardier 
an exciting development in the business jet market is the entry of the very light jet vlj into the market place 
we believe the introduction of vlj s will provide an opportunity for astronics to expand our core businesses 
during two vlj s that feature astronics products  the eclipse and the cessna mustang received faa certification and are expected to enter production during there is a wide range of projected demand for this new class of aircraft 
our view is that the vlj market will develop and our goal is to be positioned to take advantage of opportunities with each manufacturer 
there is risk involved with any new aircraft should projected production be delayed or not achieved it would impact astronics growth opportunities and expected profits 
we believe that the business jet markets will continue to provide opportunities for growth provided the economy remains healthy 
our military market sales are typically comprised of several significant programs such as the power converter for the tactical tomahawk and taurus missiles  complemented by many spare part orders covering many aircraft platforms 
a large development effort over the past several years has been the exterior lighting suite for the f joint strike fighter 
this aircraft is expected to enter low rate production in and we are in the process of negotiating a contract to support the low rate production phase of the program 
the military market is dependent on governmental funding which can change from year to year 
risks are that overall spending may be reduced in the future and that specific programs may be eliminated 
astronics does not have significant reliance on any one program such that cancellation of a particular program will cause material financial loss 
we believe that we will continue to have opportunities similar to past years regarding this market 
we continue to look for opportunities to capitalize on our core competencies of power generation and distribution and lighting to expand our existing business and to grow through strategic acquisitions 
in  astronics continued to commit significant resources for the engineering and design of next generation products which in many cases did not enter production until late or have yet to enter production 
some of the more significant efforts during were products for the various oem s developing very light business jets such as cessna aircraft  eclipse aviation and embraer 
for the military markets our larger design and development efforts have been for the exterior lighting suite for the f joint strike fighter and several smaller programs 
for the foreseeable future we expect that we will continue to have opportunities requiring levels of engineering resources comparable to we are entering with strong momentum 
each of the markets that we serve is presenting opportunities that we expect will provide continued growth for the company 
we are projecting revenues to be million driven by a strong global and aerospace economy 
we ended the year with a backlog of million of which approximately million is expected to be delivered during provided that the economy maintains its strength we anticipate that new aircraft build rates and aircraft operator spending will continue to increase over the next several years providing increased opportunities to grow revenue and profits 
we expect discretionary spending by the airlines will continue as the global commercial transport market continues its recovery 
we expect that the military market will continue to offer opportunities for us to increase the value of the content that we provide on a growing base of aircraft platforms 
challenges facing us include improving shareholder value through profitability 
increasing profitability is dependent on many things such as increased build rates for existing aircraft  market acceptance and economic success of new aircraft such as the cessna mustang and eclipse business jets  continued government funding of defense programs such as the f joint strike fighter and v osprey and the company s ability to obtain production contracts for parts we currently supply or have been selected to design and develop for these programs 
in addition we are faced with continued increasing health care and corporate governance costs  particularly those required by sarbanes oxley legislation 
finally  many of our newer development programs are based on new and unproven technology 
we are challenged to develop the technology on a schedule that is consistent with specific aircraft development programs 
we will continue to address these challenges by working to improve operating efficiencies and focusing on executing on the growth opportunities currently in front of us 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are affected by management s application of accounting policies  which are discussed in note of
