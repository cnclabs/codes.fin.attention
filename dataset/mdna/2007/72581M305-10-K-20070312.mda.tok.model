we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force and indirectly through distributors and manufacturers representatives 
we sell to distributors in japan  taiwan  china and europe  and our manufacturers representatives support some of our european and korean sales 
sales to distributors represented   and of total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our distributors typically provide engineering support to our end customers and often have valuable and established relationships with our end customers 
in certain countries it is customary to sell to distributors 
while distributor payment to us is not dependent upon the distributor s ability to resell the product or to collect from the end customer  the distributors may provide longer payment terms to end customers than those we would offer 
historically  significant portions of our revenue have been generated by sales to a relatively small number of end customers and distributors 
revenue attributable to our top five end customers represented  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
significant portions of our products are sold overseas 
sales outside the us accounted for approximately  and of total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our integrators  branded manufacturers and branded suppliers incorporate our products into systems that are sold worldwide 
all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
in april  we initiated a plan to improve our breakeven point by reducing manufacturing overhead and operating expenses and focusing on our core business 
the plan included integrating the internet protocol television iptv technology that we acquired from equator technologies  inc equator with our advanced television technology product development 
we are no longer pursuing stand alone digital media streaming markets that are not core to advanced television 
this focus and integration is expected to result in lower compensation costs  allow us to consolidate facilities and reduce rent expense 

table of contents in november  we initiated an additional restructuring plan to further reduce operating expenses 
this new plan includes further consolidation of our north american operations in order to achieve reduced compensation and rent expenses  while at the same time making critical infrastructure investments in people  process and information systems to improve our operating efficiency 
during the year ended december   we incurred  related to the restructuring plans announced in  which consists of the write off of licensed technology  tooling and software and other assets of  and costs related to termination and retention benefits of  and consolidation of leased space of  we performed an impairment analysis as of march  on the intangible developed technology  customer relationships and trademark assets acquired from equator and recorded impairment losses of  in the first quarter of  which was the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the assets 
the estimated fair value was determined using the discounted cash flow method 
the new cost basis of these acquired intangible assets is being amortized over their remaining useful lives 
we performed an impairment analysis as of june  on goodwill and recorded an impairment loss of  in the second quarter of  which was the excess carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in a manner consistent with a purchase price allocation in a business combination 
goodwill was determined to have no implied fair value and as a result  the entire balance was written off 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on a continual basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  warranty obligations  inventories  property and equipment  intangible assets  stock based compensation  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when an authorized purchase order has been received  title and risk of loss have transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
this generally occurs upon shipment of the underlying merchandise 
sales returns and allowances 
our customers do not have a stated right to return product except for replacement of defective products under our warranty program discussed below 
however  we have accepted customer returns on a case by case basis as customer accommodations in the past 
as a result  we provide for these returns in our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the reserve for returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 

table of contents certain of our distributors have stock rotation provisions in their distributor agreements  which allow them to return of the products purchased in the prior six months in exchange for products of equal value 
we analyze historical stock rotations at the end of each reporting period 
to date  returns under the stock rotation provisions have been minimal 
certain distributors also have price protection provisions in their distributor agreements with us 
under the price protection provisions  we grant distributors credit if they purchased product for a specific customer and we subsequently lower the price to the customer such that the distributor can no longer earn its negotiated margin on in stock inventory 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for price protection credits based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
the reserve for price protection is included in our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
product warranties 
we warrant that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of twelve months from delivery 
warranty repairs are guaranteed for the remainder of the original warranty period 
our warranty is limited to repairing or replacing products  or refunding the purchase price 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for warranty returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  which include actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  should actual product failure rates or product replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we offer credit to customers after careful examination of their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical write off experience and the age of outstanding receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation 
we record a reserve against our inventory for estimated obsolete  unmarketable  and otherwise impaired products by calculating the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we review our inventory at the end of each reporting period for valuation issues 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected at the time the reserve was recorded  additional inventory write downs may be required 
useful lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the remaining useful life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if there is an indicator of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of each asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized 
we test goodwill annually for impairment and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that it might be impaired 
the impairment test is performed in 
table of contents accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level 
we have assigned all goodwill to a single  enterprise level reporting unit 
the impairment test consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value is then compared to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment test in the first quarter of each year 
stock based compensation 
in accordance with sfas r  share based payment  we estimate the fair value of share based payments using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires certain estimates  including an expected forfeiture rate and expected term of options granted 
we also make decisions regarding the method of calculating expected volatilities and the risk free interest rate used in the option pricing model 
the resulting calculated fair value of share based payments is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period  generally the vesting period 
when there are any changes to the assumptions used in the option pricing model  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  there will be variations in the calculated fair value of the share based payments  causing variation in the compensation cost recognized 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
should we determine that we will be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  a decrease to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the statement of operations or equity in the period such determination was made 
tax contingency reserves are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying applications of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our tax contingency reserves contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued

table of contents revenue by market as a percentage of total revenue was as follows year ended december  multimedia projector advanced television digital streaming media devices lcd monitor other multimedia projector multimedia projector revenue increased in compared to the increase is primarily attributable to our end customers strength in the market  as well as stabilization in the market share of digital light processing dlp technology compared to high temperature polysilicon technology 
during  dlp based products  which generally do not incorporate our technology  grew in market share compared to high temperature polysilicon based products 
the market split stabilized in  enabling us to recapture market share 
units sold and asp in the multimedia projector market increased and  respectively  in compared to multimedia projector revenue decreased in to  due to market share lost to dlp products 
units sold and asp in the multimedia projector market decreased and  respectively  in compared to we expect multimedia projector revenue to decrease up to in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  primarily due to seasonal softness in orders as well as supply constraints on one of our end of life products 
advanced television advanced television revenue decreased in compared to the decrease is primarily attributable to the loss of a key original equipment manufacturer customer in europe  customer transitions from our older generation products ahead of our newer products coming to market due to delays in product development  and weakness in the market in china and europe 
units sold and asp in the advanced television market decreased and  respectively  in compared to advanced television revenue increased in compared to  which was driven by overall growth in consumer demand for increasingly feature rich lcd televisions  progressive scan televisions  plasma displays and digital rear projection televisions 
units sold in the advanced television market increased  while asp decreased in compared to we expect advanced television revenue to decrease to in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  primarily due to customers working down inventory levels from the holiday season  supply constraints on an end of life product and seasonal softness in the first quarter 
digital streaming media devices revenue in the digital streaming media devices market resulted from our acquisition of equator in june this market includes videoconferencing  set top box  and other miscellaneous applications 

table of contents in april  we initiated a plan whereby we are integrating the iptv elements of the equator technology we acquired with our advanced television technology product developments 
while we are continuing to provide customers with existing products  we are no longer pursuing stand alone digital media streaming markets that are not core to advanced television 
as a result  we expect to see revenue from existing customers in this market decreasing over time as customers switch to next generation designs from other suppliers 
in the first quarter of  we expect our digital streaming media devices revenue to decrease approximately compared to the fourth quarter of lcd monitor revenue in the lcd monitor market has decreased as a percent of total revenue from through this decrease is primarily attributable to our decision to focus on higher end products and discontinue development of mainstream products for this market  rather than any general industry trends 
we expect lcd monitor revenue to decrease to in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of our lcd monitor revenue is highly dependent on a limited number of customers and the timing of their orders  and is heavily impacted by availability of an end of life part that is supply constrained 
other other revenue includes lcd panel timing controller revenue and revenue from small niche markets 
in the future  we expect lcd panel timing controller revenue  a developing market  to increase if we are able to secure additional design wins 
revenue from small niche markets is not expected to be significant in the near future 
cost of revenue and gross profit cost of revenue includes purchased materials  assembly  test  labor  warranty expense  royalties  provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory  amortization of acquired developed technology  amortization of the fair value adjustment on acquired inventory  stock based compensation and information technology and facilities allocations  as well as an impairment loss on acquired developed technology and a restructuring charge in  and the amortization of acquired backlog in gross profit margin was in  in and in the decrease in gross profit in is primarily due to the recognition of a  impairment loss on acquired developed technology and a restructuring charge of  partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related amortization expense of  additionally  increases in inventory scrap and provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory  charges for customer materials never utilized in production  and stock based compensation expense all contributed to the decrease in gross profit in the decrease in gross profit in from primarily resulted from an increase in acquisition related amortization of  acquisition related amortization was  or of revenue  in compared to  or of revenue  in declines in gross profit margin are characteristic of our industry and the markets we serve  and we expect declines to occur again in the future  although we cannot predict when or how severe they will be 
as a result  we actively seek ways to reduce the cost to manufacture our products and introduce new products with higher margins 

table of contents estimated amortization of acquired developed technology is    and  for the years ending december    and  respectively 
we expect our gross profit margin to be between and for the first quarter of research and development research and development expense includes compensation and related costs for personnel  depreciation and amortization  fees for outside services  expensed equipment  and information technology and facilities allocations 
research and development expense increased  or  to  in from  in this increase is primarily due to the following offsetting factors depreciation and amortization expense increased  primarily due to increased licensed technology and software asset purchases made at the end of stock based compensation expense increased  as a result of our adoption of sfas r on january  under sfas r  we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option pricing model and recognize stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
previously  stock based compensation expense was recognized only in the event options were granted at an exercise price less than the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
facilities and information technology expenses allocated to research and development increased the increase in facilities and information technology expenses was driven by increases in depreciation and amortization expense  outside services  and telephone and other communications charges 
compensation expense decreased  while headcount in our research and development cost centers was consistent at at december  and  the restructuring plans we initiated in april and november have shifted research and development to locations in asia from locations in north america 
development related expenses  including non recurring engineering and outside services  decreased due to the timing of projects in process 
research and development expense increased  or  to  in from  in this increase is primarily due to the following factors compensation expense increased  due to an increase in headcount in research and development cost centers to at december  from at december  this increase includes in our shanghai design center  and that resulted from our acquisition of equator 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in tualatin headcount  which was primarily attributable to the restructuring we initiated in october of development related expenses  including non recurring engineering and outside services  increased  depreciation and amortization expense increased  primarily due to increased licensed technology and software asset purchases 
facilities and information technology expenses allocated to research and development increased  the increase in facilities and information technology expenses was driven by increased headcount in information technology departments and rent expense  which were in part attributable 
table of contents to the addition of equator  and increased depreciation and amortization expense  expensed equipment and software  and telephone and other communications charges

travel related expenses increased we expect to continue to make investments in our selling  general and administrative infrastructure to support the global expansion and scalability of our business systems and increased sales related efforts 

table of contents impairment loss on goodwill we recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisitions of equator in june  ndsp in january  and panstera in january as the market value of our common stock fell below our book value during the second quarter of  we performed an additional goodwill impairment test on june  in the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of  which represented the excess carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in a manner consistent with a purchase price allocation in a business combination 
at the time of the impairment analysis  goodwill was determined to have no implied fair value 
impairment loss on acquired intangible assets we recorded intangible customer relationships and trademark assets in connection with the acquisition of equator in june during the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss on the customer relationships and trademark assets of  which represented the excess carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the assets 
as of december   the net book value of the customer relationships intangible asset is  which will be amortized over the asset s remaining useful life of approximately months 
at the time of the impairment analysis  the trademark asset was determined to have no remaining value 
restructuring in april  we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our breakeven point by reducing manufacturing overhead and operating expenses and focusing on our core business 
the plan included integrating the iptv technology we acquired from equator with our advanced television technology product development 
we are no longer pursuing stand alone digital media streaming markets not core to advanced television 
the focus and integration is expected to result in lower compensation costs  allow us to consolidate facilities and reduce rent expense 
in november  we initiated an additional restructuring plan to further reduce operating expenses 
this new plan includes further consolidation of our north american operations in order to achieve reduced compensation and rent expenses  while at the same time making critical infrastructure investments in people  process and information systems to improve our operating efficiency 
during  we recognized  in restructuring expense  of which  is included in cost of revenue 
total restructuring expense includes  for the write off of certain assets  including licensed technology and tooling   for termination and retention benefits and  for costs associated with the consolidation of lease space 
as of december   we have accrued restructuring expenses of approximately  in our consolidated balance sheet  which consist of termination and retention benefits payable of  and accrued remaining lease payments of  as we continue implementing the restructuring plan announced in november  we expect to incur restructuring charges of  to  over the next several quarters 
in october  we initiated a restructuring plan to improve the effectiveness and timeliness of our product development efforts in order to reduce our overall development costs 
the restructuring resulted in a reduction in force of employees during the fourth quarter of these employees were given severance benefits  which were expensed and paid in the fourth quarter of the total amount of these benefits was approximately  as of december   we had a nominal amount accrued related to this restructuring  which was paid in january 
table of contents amortization of acquired intangible assets we recorded intangible customer relationships and trademark assets in connection with the acquisition of equator in june  and an intangible assembled workforce asset as a result of the jaldi asset acquisition in september these acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the following useful lives customer relationships and assembled workforce  three years  and trademark  one year

interest income increased  or  in from and  or  in from the increase in interest income in from is attributable to higher average rates of return on invested funds  and the increase in from is attributable to the investment of the proceeds from the issuance of our convertible subordinated debentures in may and june interest expense consists primarily of interest payable on the debentures 
interest expense increased in from and  in from the increase in interest expense in from is due to the issuance of the debentures in may and june during the fourth quarter of  our claim against funds placed in escrow in connection with the equator acquisition was settled 
we received proceeds net of legal fees of  which is included in interest and other income  net for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  we realized a loss on the sale of marketable securities of the proceeds from the sale of these marketable securities were used to fund the acquisition of equator 
debt issuance costs related to the debentures have been capitalized and are included in long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
the debt issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over seven years and have a remaining useful life of approximately years as of december  
table of contents provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of for the year ended december  the benefit is primarily attributable to an income tax refund that will be received through a net operating loss carryback to a prior year  plus the recognition of deferred tax assets in profitable cost plus foreign jurisdictions 
these benefits are partially offset by current tax expense in profitable cost plus foreign jurisdictions  as well as additional accruals for exposures in foreign jurisdictions 
we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against our us and canadian deferred tax assets as of december  as it is not more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of these assets in future periods 
we considered future taxable income by jurisdiction  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies when making this assessment 
we recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december  despite the recognition of a pre tax book loss 
this is primarily attributable to the fourth quarter addition of approximately  of valuation allowance against essentially all deferred tax assets and contingent amounts for exposures in foreign jurisdictions 
the tax detriment of these items was partially offset by federal  state and foreign tax credits and tax exempt interest generated during the year  and a refund relating to our canadian subsidiary s foreign research and experimentation credits 
we recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december  tax expense was lower than the expected expense based on the statutory rates due to several permanent differences  primarily relating to federal and state research and experimentation tax credits 
the tax benefit of these items is partially offset by an increase in the federal tax rate from to  along with contingent amounts established for exposures in foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   we have generated deductible temporary differences along with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have approximately   and  of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and approximately   and  of tax credit carryforwards to offset future tax for federal  state and foreign purposes  respectively 
utilization of a portion of the remaining net operating loss and credit carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions  and the net operating loss carryforwards acquired from equator in the amount of approximately  federal and  state may not be realizable due to tax regulations relating to changes in the business activities of the acquired entity 
the carryforwards began expiring in liquidity and capital resources at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of  short and long term marketable securities of  and working capital of  cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was  compared to and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations during is primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable and inventory offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued current and long term liabilities and the net loss during the year

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity 
table of contents has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
the provisions of sfas should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption  with certain exceptions 
we are currently in the process of assessing the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin is an interpretation of sfas  accounting for income taxes and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early application encouraged if financial statements  including interim financial statements  have not been issued in the period of adoption 
the provisions of fin shall be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not criteria at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year  presented separately  which is the difference between the net amount of assets and liabilities recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the application of fin and the net amount of assets and liabilities recognized as a result of applying the provisions of fin we are in the process of assessing the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is the impact of interest rate fluctuations on interest income earned on our investment portfolio 
we mitigate risks associated with such fluctuations  as well as the risk of loss of principal  by investing in high credit quality securities and limiting concentrations of issuers and maturity dates 
derivative financial instruments are not part of our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had convertible subordinated debentures of million outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 
interest rate changes affect the fair value of these notes  but do not affect our earnings or cash flow 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our sales 
we have employees located in offices in canada  japan  taiwan and the people s republic of china and as such  a portion of our operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we cannot reasonably estimate the effect that an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our operating results or cash flows 
currently  we do not hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations
