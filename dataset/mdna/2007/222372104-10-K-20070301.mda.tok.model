risk factors of this report 
overview this section gives an overview of critical items that are discussed in more detail throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
who we are we are a diversified financial services company engaged in real estate finance related businesses 
we organize our business into five segments mortgage banking  banking  capital markets  insurance and global operations 
results of operations following is a summary of our key performance measurements for the years ended december  and years ended december  change in millions  except per share amounts consolidated company revenues net earnings diluted eps total assets in billions key segment pre tax earnings mortgage banking banking capital markets insurance key operating statistics in billions total loan fundings mortgage banking loan sales ending loan servicing portfolio ending assets of banking operations our consolidated net earnings for were  million  an increase of from s net earnings of  million 
the increase in our earnings resulted primarily from an increase in earnings from our banking and capital markets segments  which produced pre tax earnings of  million and million  respectively  increases of and from the prior year 
these increases partially were offset by a decrease in the profitability of our mortgage banking segment 
the increase in profitability of our banking segment was primarily due to a increase in average interest earning assets in banking operations from the increase in profitability of our capital markets segment was due to an increase in revenue from all of the segment s activities 
our mortgage banking segment remains the largest contributor to our earnings 
the mortgage banking segment is comprised of three sectors loan production  loan servicing and closing services 
in  the mortgage banking segment contributed of consolidated pre tax income  or  million 
this was a decrease of from  primarily due to a decrease in the profitability of our production sector 
the production sector s results were negatively impacted by reduced loan production and sales  along with our continuing investment in increasing the sector s production capacity 
loan production was affected by the reduced size of the mortgage market  which we estimated was trillion for compared to trillion for based on our estimates of the size of the mortgage market  we increased our consolidated market share to for from in the year ago period 
our market share growth came from increased production primarily from our retail channel 
credit historically  our primary source of credit risk has been the continuing investment and or obligations we retain either in the form of credit enhancing subordinated interests  representations and warranties issued when we sell or securitize loans or corporate guarantees 
estimated credit losses are considered in the valuation of our subordinated interests  however  the entire carrying value of such interests is generally at risk in that cash flow accruing to these interests is available to absorb credit losses in the loan pools underlying such subordinated interests 
we held billion of subordinated interests at december   an increase of from december  our recorded liability for representations and warranties was million at december   an increase of from december  our corporate guarantees provided in the financial statements at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the contractual limit of our corporate guarantees exceeded the amounts recorded by million and million at december  and  respectively 
as our portfolio of investment loans has grown  our portfolio credit risk has also grown 
our allowance for credit losses was million at december   an increase of from december  the increase in our allowance for loan losses reflects prevailing real estate market and economic conditions and the seasoning of the bank s investment loan portfolio 
we expect the allowance for loan losses to increase  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our loan portfolio as our loan portfolio continues to season and as current market conditions develop 
however  we believe that our investment criteria have provided us with a high quality investment portfolio and that our credit losses should stay within acceptable levels 
we also believe our allowances and provisions for credit losses are adequate pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles 
liquidity and capital as part of our ongoing capital optimization plan  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to billion 
in connection with this program  we repurchased billion of our common stock in november and financed this activity through the issuance of junior subordinated debentures 
the transaction is subject to a market price adjustment payment based on the actual volume weighted average price of our common stock during the repurchase period 
the price adjustment payment will be settled  at our election  in our common stock or cash 
the final settlement is expected to occur in the second quarter of at december   we exceeded the regulatory capital requirements to be classified as well capitalized  with a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based ratio of 
our public ratings were classified investment grade  with long term ratings of a  a and a by standard poors  moody s investors service and fitch  respectively 
outlook we estimate the mortgage market for to be trillion as compared to our estimate of trillion for we believe that this decline will result in further industry consolidation as companies either exit the business or attempt to align themselves with stronger entities 
in addition to lower mortgage loan volumes in  we believe that the industry will also experience continued pressure on margins and housing prices  as well as increased defaults and foreclosures 
in early  we have observed an increase in investor yield requirements for nonprime loans  which may adversely impact the gain on sale realized from such loans 
the increased investor yield requirements  separately or combined with the trend of increasing defaults and foreclosures  may also have a negative impact on the value of our credit subordinated securities 
in addition  increasing defaults and foreclosures  along with a slowdown in home price appreciation or price depreciation in some markets and worsening economic conditions may result in higher credit losses in the future 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies with the greatest impact on our financial condition and results of operations that require the most judgment  and which are most likely to result in materially different amounts being recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions  pertain to our mortgage securitization activities  our investments in msrs and retained interests  our measurement of provisions and reserves associated with the credit risk inherent in our operations and our use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
our critical accounting policies involve the following five areas accounting for gain on sales of loans and securities  accounting for msrs and retained interests  including valuation of msrs and retained interests  valuation of liabilities incurred in sale or securitization of loans  allowance for loan losses  and accounting for derivatives and our related interest rate risk management activities 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for servicing of financial assets sfas  which amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for  and reporting of  the recognition and measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas has changed the company s accounting policies relating to gain on sale of loans and securities and the accounting for msrs subsequent to their initial recognition  effective january  gain on sale of loans and securities when we sell loans in the secondary mortgage market  we generally do not sell the msrs that are created 
depending on the type of securitization  we may also retain other financial interests  including interest only securities  principal only securities and residual securities 
we determine the gain on sale of a security or loans by allocating the carrying value of the underlying mortgage loans between securities or loans sold and the interests we continue to hold  based on their relative fair values 
the gain on sale we report is the difference between the proceeds we receive from the sale and the cost allocated to the securities or loans sold 
the proceeds include cash and other assets obtained primarily msrs less any liabilities incurred ie  liabilities for representations and warranties or other recourse provisions 
the timing of gain recognition is dependent on the terms of the transaction meeting very specific accounting criteria and  as a result  the gain on sale may be recorded in a different form or in a different accounting period from when the transfer of the loans is completed 
in addition  the amount of gain on sale recorded is influenced by the values of the msrs and retained interests at the time of sale 
see the valuation of msrs and retained interest section of this report for a discussion of the judgments and estimates involved in the valuation of msrs and retained interests 
here is an example of how this accounting works carrying value of mortgage loans underlying a security fair values security msrs retained interests liabilities incurred sales proceeds cash msrs liabilities incurred fair value used to allocate basis loans sold sales proceeds retained interests computation of gain on sale of security sales proceeds less cost allocated to loans sold  gain on sale initial recorded value of retained interests   the carrying value of mortgage loans includes the outstanding principal balance of the loans  net of deferred origination costs and fees  any premiums or discounts and any basis adjustment resulting from hedge accounting 
valuation of msrs and retained interests the precise market value of msrs and retained interests cannot be readily determined because these assets are not actively traded in stand alone markets 
considerable judgment is required to determine the fair values of our msrs and retained interests  and the exercise of such judgment can significantly impact the company s earnings 
small changes in the assumptions used to estimate the value of msrs and retained interests can have a significant effect on our estimates of value 
similarly  relatively small changes in value of these assets can have a material effect on earnings for a particular period 
as a result  senior financial management exercises extensive and active oversight of this process 
the company s asset liability committee  which is comprised of several of our senior financial executives  ultimately determines the valuation of msrs and retained interests 
our msr valuation process combines the use of a discounted cash flow model and extensive analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value at each balance sheet date 
the cash flow assumptions and prepayment assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model are based on market factors and encompass the historical performance of our msrs 
we believe that the assumptions we use are consistent with assumptions and data used by market participants valuing similar msrs 
the key assumptions used in the valuation of msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds and the discount rate projected london inter bank offering rate libor plus option adjusted spread 
these variables can  and generally do  change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change 
the current market data utilized in the msr valuation process and in the assessment of the reasonableness of our valuation is obtained from peer group msr valuation surveys  msr market trades  msr broker valuations and prices of interest only securities 
the following table shows the key assumptions we used to determine the fair values of our msrs at december  and the value sensitivity of our msrs to changes in such assumptions 
msrs dollar amounts in thousands fair value of msrs fair value as a percentage of msr portfolio weighted average service fee multiple of net service fee weighted average life in years weighted average annual prepayment speed impact of adverse change impact of adverse change impact of adverse change weighted average oas impact of adverse change impact of adverse change impact of adverse change option adjusted spread over libor 
the yield implied in the market value of the msrs was at december  for our retained interests  we also estimate fair value through the use of discounted cash flow models 
the key assumptions used in the valuation of our retained interests include mortgage prepayment speeds  discount rates  and for retained interests containing credit risk  the net lifetime credit losses 
for further discussion of credit risk  see section in this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk retained in loan sales 
we develop cash flow  prepayment and net lifetime credit loss assumptions based on the historical performance of the loans underlying our retained interests 
we believe that such empirical data are consistent with assumptions that other major market participants use in determining such assets fair values 
the process for estimating lifetime credit losses used in the valuation of residual interests or the valuation of liabilities incurred is similar 
see the section following entitled valuation of liabilities incurred in the sale of loans for additional discussion of estimated lifetime credit losses 
the following table shows the key assumptions we used to determine the fair values of our retained interests at december   and the fair value sensitivity of our retained interests to changes in such assumptions 
retained interests dollar amounts in thousands fair value of retained interests weighted average life in years weighted average annual prepayment speed impact of adverse change impact of adverse change impact of adverse change weighted average annual discount rate impact of adverse change impact of adverse change impact of adverse change weighted average net lifetime credit losses impact of adverse change impact of adverse change impact of adverse change these sensitivities shown for msrs and retained interests are solely for illustrative purposes and should be used with caution 
this information is furnished to provide the reader with a basis for assessing the sensitivity of the values presented to changes in key assumptions 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a given percentage variation in individual assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated 
in addition  in the above tables  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the msrs or retained interests is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may coincide with changes in another  which could compound or counteract the sensitivities 
valuation of liabilities incurred in sale of loans we incur liabilities in our loan sales and securitizations through representations and warranties we make or through other recourse provisions  such as corporate guarantees 
an active market to transfer the liabilities relating to representations and warranties and corporate guarantees does not exist 
therefore  management must estimate the fair value of such liabilities 
when credit risk is retained through liabilities incurred in the sale or securitization of loans  the lifetime credit losses are estimated as follows and are discounted at a risk free rate of return 
lifetime credit losses are developed by estimating when and how many loans will default and multiplying that amount by how much of the loan will be uncollectible loss severity 
default rates are estimated using default curves used for pricing securities backed by the type of loans for which the obligation is being retained 
loss severities are estimated using multi attribute severity models similar in nature to those used to calculate probability of default 
our process for estimating lifetime credit losses benefits from the extensive history and experience we have developed from our mortgage loan servicing portfolio 
this estimation process is also subject to the uncertainties that reliance on historical information factors giving rise to losses and offsetting recoveries does not accurately reflect current conditions or predict future events 
the effect of changes in certain key assumptions on our estimated liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is as follows liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees in thousands liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees at december  impact of a change in default rates on the liability of a adverse change adverse change adverse change impact of a change in loss severity on the liability of a adverse change adverse change adverse change credit risk is an integral consideration in the valuation of retained interests 
the impact of changes in credit loss assumptions on the value of retained interests is included in the section  valuation of msrs and retained interests 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is our best estimate of the credit losses incurred in our loan investment portfolio 
we continually assess the credit quality of our portfolios of loans held for investment to identify and provide for losses incurred 
once a loan is included in our investment portfolio  how we assesses loan credit quality is based on whether the loan is part of a pool of homogeneous loans or is individually evaluated for impairment 
homogeneous loan pools our mortgage loan portfolios are comprised primarily of large groups of homogeneous loans that are secured by residential real estate and are made to consumers 
we do not evaluate individual homogenous loans for impairment 
we estimate the losses incurred in our homogeneous loan pools by estimating how many of the loans will default and how much of the loans balances will be lost in the event of default 
we estimate how many of our homogeneous loans will default based on the loans attributes occupancy  loan to value  borrower credit score  etc 
which is further broken down by present collection status delinquency 
this estimate is based on our historical experience with our loan servicing portfolio 
the likelihood of default is based on analysis of movement of loans with the measured attributes from each delinquency category to default over a twelve month period 
loans more than days past due are assigned a rate of default that measures the percentage of such loans that will default over their lives as we assume that the condition causing the ultimate default presently exists 
we estimate how much of the defaulted loans balances will be lost based on our estimate of the average loss severity for defaulted loans by type prime mortgage  nonprime mortgage or prime home equity loans 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the loss is confirmed 
individually evaluated loans on a regular basis  we individually evaluate loans in our warehouse lending portfolio for impairment based on borrower provided financial information and our assessments of collateral 
we have an internally developed loan rating system for our warehouse lending loans that is used to determine when an allowance for loan loss is required for a given loan 
we charge off losses in individually evaluated loans when the loss is confirmed 
the charge off is based on our estimate of value of the collateral securing the loan 
we develop an allowance for losses on warehouse lending loans for which specific losses have not been identified 
this allowance is developed by applying credit loss factors applicable to the individual loan s assigned ratings 
sensitivity of estimates our allowance estimation process benefits from the extensive history and experience we have developed in our mortgage loan servicing activities 
however  this process is subject to risks and uncertainties  including reliance on historical loss information that may not represent current conditions and the proper identification of factors giving rise to credit losses 
for example  new products may have default rates and loss severities which differ from those products we have historically offered and upon which our estimates are based 
we address this risk by actively monitoring the delinquency and default experience of our homogenous pools by considering current economic and market conditions 
based on our assessments of current conditions  we make appropriate adjustments to our historically developed assumptions when necessary to adjust historical factors to account for present conditions 
our senior management is actively involved in the review and approval of our allowance for loan losses 
the following example illustrates the sensitivity of our allowance for loan losses to changes in assumptions allowance for loan losses in thousands allowance for loan losses at december  impact of a change in default rates on the required allowance of adverse change adverse change adverse change impact of a change in loss severity on required allowance of adverse change adverse change adverse change these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
in the preceding tables  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the allowance for loan losses is calculated independently without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another which might compound or counteract the sensitivities 
derivatives and interest rate risk management activities we use derivatives extensively in connection with our interest rate risk management activities 
we record all derivative instruments at fair value 
we may qualify some of our interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting 
a primary requirement to qualify for hedge accounting is the documented expectation and demonstration initially and on an ongoing basis that our interest rate risk management activity is highly effective 
we use standard statistical measures to determine the effectiveness of our hedging activity 
if we are unable to  or choose not to  qualify certain interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting  then a possible earnings mismatch may be created because  unlike the derivative instruments  the change in fair value of the related asset or liability may not be reflected in current period earnings 
this issue is potentially most significant with our inventory of loans held for sale  which is required to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or market and our debt instruments and other liabilities that are carried at historical cost 
in connection with our mortgage loan origination activities  we issue interest rate lock commitments irlcs to loan applicants and financial intermediaries 
an irlc guarantees a loan s terms  subject to credit approval  for a period typically between seven and days 
the majority of our irlcs qualify as derivative instruments and  therefore  are required to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in current period earnings 
however  there is no active market for irlcs that can be used to determine their fair value and as result we utilize an alternative method for estimating the fair value of our irlcs 
we estimate the fair value of an irlc based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan  adjusted for the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc 
the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is based on quoted mbs prices and is measured from the date we issue the commitment 
therefore  at the time of issuance the estimated fair value of an irlc is zero 
after issuance  the value of an irlc can be either positive or negative  depending on the change in value of the underlying mortgage loan 
the primary factor influencing the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc is the change  if any  in mortgage rates subsequent to the commitment date 
in general  the probability of funding increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicant s committed rate 
the probability that a loan will fund within the terms of the irlc also is influenced by the source of the application  age of the application  purpose for the loan purchase or refinance and the application approval rate 
we have developed closing ratio estimates using empirical data that take into account all of these variables  as well as renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
these closing ratio estimates are used to calculate the aggregate balance of loans that we expect to fund within the terms of the irlcs 
results of operations comparison year ended december  and year ended december  consolidated earnings performance net earnings for were  million  a increase from our diluted earnings per share were  a increase from the year ago period 
the increase in our earnings resulted primarily from the banking segment  which produced pre tax earnings of  million  an increase of from the prior year  and our capital markets segment  which produced pre tax earnings of million  an increase of from the prior year 
the increase in profitability of our banking segment was primarily due to a increase in average interest earning assets in banking operations from the prior year 
the increase in profitability of our capital markets segment was due to increased revenue from all sources 
the increase in earnings from our banking and capital market segments was partially offset by a decrease in the profitability of our mortgage banking segment  which produced pre tax earnings of  million for  a decrease of from the decrease in the profitability of our mortgage banking segment was primarily due to a decline in the profitability of our loan production sector  as the increase in revenues from higher gain on sale margins was more than offset by increased operating expenses as the company continued to build its production capacity 
operating segment results pre tax earnings loss by segment are summarized below years ended december  in thousands mortgage banking loan production loan servicing loan closing services total mortgage banking banking capital markets insurance global operations other total the pre tax earnings loss of each segment include intercompany transactions  which are eliminated in the other category 
mortgage loan production by segment and product  net of intersegment sales  is summarized below years ended december  in millions segment mortgage banking banking operations capital markets conduit acquisitions total mortgage loan fundings commercial real estate product prime mortgage prime home equity nonprime mortgage commercial real estate acquisitions from third parties 
our total loan production was billion for  a decrease from the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in total us residential mortgage production  offset by an increase in our market share 
the following table summarizes loan production by purpose and by interest rate type years ended december  in millions purpose non purchase purchase interest rate type fixed rate adjustable rate mortgage banking segment the mortgage banking segment includes the loan production  loan servicing and loan closing services sectors 
the loan production and loan closing services sectors generally perform most profitably when mortgage interest rates are relatively low and the demand for mortgage loans is high 
conversely  the loan servicing sector generally performs well when mortgage interest rates are relatively high and loan prepayments are low 
we generally expect the natural counterbalance of these sectors  which we refer to as the macro hedge  to reduce the impact of changes in mortgage interest rates on our earnings over the long term 
loan production sector the loan production sector sources mortgage loans through the three production channels of chl the retail channel consumer markets and full spectrum lending  wholesale lending channel and correspondent lending channel 
these loans are funded through any one of these channels or through countrywide bank 
the following table summarizes mortgage banking loan production by channel  by mortgage loan type  by purpose and by interest rate type years ended december  in millions channel originated retail consumer markets full spectrum lending wholesale lending total originated purchased correspondent lending mortgage loan type prime mortgage prime home equity nonprime mortgage purpose non purchase purchase interest rate type fixed rate adjustable rate billion and billion of these loans were funded by countrywide bank during and  respectively

in and  billion and billion of mortgage loans  respectively  or of mortgage banking loan production in each period  was sold 
expenses in dollars and as a percentage of loans produced increased from the prior year  primarily due to costs incurred to support our investment in expanding the loan sales force and distributed branch network in furtherance of our long term strategy of market share growth 
in addition  a lower deferral rate of expenses under sfas contributed to the increase in expenses 
we have adjusted our production capacity in markets where declines in production require such adjustments 
we continue to expand our loan production capacity in markets where we have identified opportunities for growth 
following is a summary of our loan production channels sales organizations december  sales force branches call centers sales force branches call centers channel retail consumer markets full spectrum lending wholesale lending correspondent lending the primary capacity constraint in our loan origination activities is the number of loan operations personnel we have on staff 
management adjusts staffing levels to account for changes in the current and projected near term mortgage market 
the following table summarizes the number of people included in the loan production sector workforce december  sales operations regular employees temporary staff administration and support total loan production sector workforce loan servicing sector our loan servicing sector includes a workforce of approximately  who service almost million mortgage loans 
the loan servicing sector s results include fees and other income earned and expenses incurred for servicing loans for others  the financial performance of our investments in msrs and retained interests and the risk management activities related to these assets  and profits from our subservicing activities 
the long term performance of this sector is affected primarily by the level of interest rates  the corresponding effect on the level of projected and actual prepayments in our servicing portfolio  projected and actual credit losses  our operational effectiveness and our ability to manage interest rate risk 
our servicing portfolio grew to trillion at december   a increase from december  at the same time  the overall weighted average note rate of loans in our servicing portfolio increased to from at december  the following table summarizes the results for the loan servicing sector years ended december  amount percentage of average servicing portfolio amount percentage of average servicing portfolio dollar amounts in thousands servicing fees  net of guarantee fees escrow balance income miscellaneous fees income from retained interests realization of expected cash flows from mortgage servicing rights amortization of mortgage servicing rights operating revenues direct expenses allocated corporate expenses total expenses operating earnings interest expense change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights recovery of mortgage servicing rights impairment of retained interests servicing hedge losses valuation changes  net of servicing hedge pre tax earnings average servicing portfolio pre tax earnings in the loan servicing sector were million during  a decrease of million from the decrease in pre tax earnings is primarily due to increased interest expense substantially offset by an improvement in operating earnings 
the increase in interest expense was driven by a larger average investment in servicing sector assets  increased leverage on those assets and increased cost of debt 
the increase in operating earnings was due mainly to a larger portfolio and higher escrow balance benefit resulting from an increase in the escrow earnings rate 
as a result of the adoption of sfas  msrs are carried at fair value with the change in value recorded in current period earnings 
the primary factors causing a change in fair value of msrs are changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions  primarily due to changes in interest rates and other market factors shown as change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights in the preceding table and realization of expected cash flows from msrs 
loan closing services sector this sector is comprised of the landsafe companies  which provide credit reports  flood determinations  appraisals and title reports primarily to the loan production sector and to third parties as well 
the landsafe companies produced million in pre tax earnings in  representing a decrease of from the decrease in landsafe s pre tax earnings was primarily due to the decline in loan production 
banking segment the banking segment includes the investment and fee based activities of countrywide bank banking operations  along with the activities of countrywide warehouse lending cwl  a provider of mortgage inventory financing to other mortgage bankers 
the bank also produces loans for sale through our mortgage banking segment 
this activity is a mortgage banking activity and the mortgage loan production  the related balance sheet and the income relating to the holding and sale of these loans are included in the mortgage banking segment 
the banking segment achieved pre tax earnings of  million during  compared to  million for the prior year 
following is the composition of pre tax earnings years ended december  in thousands banking operations cwl allocated corporate expenses total banking segment pre tax earnings not included in calculation of banking operations efficiency ratio 
banking operations sources the loan production for its investment portfolio from the mortgage banking production channels and through purchases from nonaffiliated entities 
following is a summary of banking operations loan production and purchase volume by channel years ended december  in millions purchases correspondent lending wholesale lending consumer markets the loan production retained in our investment portfolio was billion in  compared to billion in this decline contributed to slower asset growth in our banking operations 
our strategic plan calls for continued long term growth in bank assets  however  many factors may impact the asset growth in any period 
these include general mortgage market conditions  the availability of assets which meet the yield requirements of our banking operations and our consolidated capital and earnings considerations 
the revenues and expenses of banking operations are summarized in the following table years ended december  dollar amounts in thousands interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses non interest income non interest expense pre tax earnings efficiency ratio after tax return on average assets non interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income plus non interest income 
the banking operations efficiency ratio reflects the expense structure resulting from its relationship with chl 
if the banking operations of countrywide bank were a stand alone entity  the nature and amount of its expenses would differ from those reported 
for example  the fulfillment fees paid by countrywide bank to the loan production sector for origination costs incurred on investment mortgage loans funded by countrywide bank are generally determined on an incremental cost basis which is less than would be incurred in an arms length transaction 
the components of net interest income of banking operations are summarized below years ended december  average balance interest income expense annualized yield rate average balance interest income expense annualized yield rate dollar amounts in thousands interest earning assets mortgage loans securities available for sale short term investments fhlb securities and frb stock total earning assets allowance for loan losses other assets total assets interest bearing liabilities money market deposits and savings accounts company controlled custodial deposits time deposits total interest bearing deposits fhlb advances other borrowed funds total borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities and equity non interest bearing checking other liabilities shareholder s equity total non interest bearing liabilities and equity total liabilities and shareholder s equity net interest income net interest spread net interest margin average balances include nonaccrual loans 
average balances and yields for securities available for sale are based on average amortized cost computed on the settlement date basis 
represents an intercompany rate paid to the loan servicing sector 
calculated as yield on total average interest earning assets less rate on total average interest bearing liabilities 
calculated as net interest income divided by total average interest earning assets 
the dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense change depending upon changes in interest rates and in the relative volumes of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes attributable to i changes in volume changes in average outstanding balances multiplied by the prior period s rate  ii changes in rate changes in average interest rate multiplied by the prior period s volume  and iii changes in rate volume changes in rate multiplied by the change in volume which were allocated proportionately to the changes in volume and the changes in rate and included in the relevant column below are as follows vs 
increase decrease due to volume rate total changes in thousands interest earning assets mortgage loans securities available for sale short term investments fhlb securities and frb stock total interest income interest bearing liabilities money market deposits and savings accounts company controlled custodial deposits time deposits total deposits fhlb advances other borrowed funds total borrowings total interest expense net interest income the increase in net interest income is primarily due to a billion or increase in average interest earning assets  combined with a basis point increase in net interest margin 
the increase in the net interest margin from the prior year was a result of the reduced impact of teaser rates earned on recently funded pay option arm loans owing to the reduced level of additions in combined with an increase in the proportion of the non interest bearing liabilities and equity used to finance interest earning assets 
these benefits were partially offset by an increase in in the repricing lag between the libor rates to which most of the banking operations liabilities are indexed and the mta index month treasury average to which an increasing percentage of its assets are indexed 
the banking operation s provision for loan losses increased by million during compared to this increase reflects increased delinquencies and loss levels resulting from seasoning of loans acquired during the past years of rapid portfolio growth  as well as prevailing real estate and market conditions 
in addition  current portfolio growth has also contributed to the increase in the provision for loan losses 
the increase in the banking operation s provision for loan losses is partially offset by provision reductions which occur when the bank requires the mortgage banking segment to purchase loans sourced by the production sector for underwriting or processing defects or other matters 
the provision for loan losses and the related allowance for loan losses is impacted by many factors  including economic conditions for example  housing prices  interest rates and unemployment rates  the borrower s credit profile  the loan s payment requirements  delinquency  loan seasoning and prepayments 
banking operations holds a substantial investment in pay option arm loans 
these loans have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually  resulting in the potential for negative amortization 
minimum monthly payments may increase by no more than per year unless the unpaid balance increases to a specified limit  which is no more than of the original loan amount  at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established 
to ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan  the fully amortizing loan payment amount is re established after either five or ten years and again every five years thereafter 
assuming today s interest rates remain unchanged  most borrowers who consistently make the minimum required payment will have the contractual right to make less than the full interest payment for three to four years from the date of funding  at which time the negative amortization cap will be reached and a new monthly payment amount will be required 
the resulting payment adjustment could be substantial 
we manage the credit risk relating to pay option arm loans through a variety of methods  including active borrower communications both before and after funding and through our underwriting standards 
our underwriting standards conform to those required to make the pay option arm loans salable into the secondary market at the date of funding  including a requirement that the borrower meet secondary market debt service ratio tests based on the borrower making the fully amortizing loan payment and assuming the loan s interest rate is fully indexed 
a fully indexed note rate equals the sum of the current index rate plus the margin applicable to the loan

a fico score is a measure of borrower creditworthiness determined using a statistical model 
fico scores range from approximately to  with a higher score indicating an individual with a more favorable credit profile

the banking segment also includes the operations of cwl

net interest income from custodial balances increased in the current year primarily due to an increase in the earnings rate from during  to during  and to a lesser extent to an increase of million  or  in average custodial balances over the prior year 
interest income on custodial balances is reduced by the interest we are required to pass through to security holders on paid off loans 
we are required to pass through a full month s interest to security holders on paid off loans  regardless of the payoff date  at the underlying security rates  which were substantially higher than the short term rates earned by us on the payoff float 
the amount of such interest passed through to the security holders was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense allocated to the loan servicing sector increased primarily due to the effect of rising interest rates  combined with an increase in total servicing sector assets and increased leverage of those assets 
the decrease in net interest income from the capital markets securities portfolio is attributable to a decrease in the net interest margin from in to in  partially offset by an increase of in the average inventory of securities held 
the decrease in the net interest margin earned on the securities portfolio is primarily due to the flattening and inversion of the yield curve 
the decline in net interest income was offset by an increase in gain on sale of loans 
the increase in the provision for loan losses is due to the continuing growth and seasoning of the banking segment s loan portfolio 
in addition  deteriorating credit performance of loans held for investment in our mortgage banking segment during contributed to the increase in the provision for loan losses

realization of expected cash flows from mortgage servicing rights effective january   we adopted sfas and elected to carry our msrs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
the change in fair value of the msrs that is included in earnings for consists of two primary components a reduction in fair value due to the realization of expected cash flows from the msrs and a change in value resulting from changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions  primarily due to changes in interest rates  and other market factors 
the realization of expected cash flows from msrs during resulted in a value reduction of  million 
change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights we recorded an increase in the fair value of the msrs in of million primarily as a result of the increase in mortgage rates during the period 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights we recorded amortization of msrs of  million  or an annual rate of  during the amortization rate of the msrs was dependent on the forecasted prepayment speeds at the beginning of the period 
recovery of mortgage servicing rights during  we recovered previously recorded impairment of msrs of million  primarily driven by an increase in mortgage interest rates during the period 
impairment of retained interests in  we recognized impairment of retained interests of million 
the collateral underlying certain of the retained interests residual securities is fixed rate for a defined period of time while the pass through rate is floating 
an increase in projected short term interest rates during the period caused compression of the spread on such residuals  which resulted in a decline in their value 
our interest only securities also decreased in value  caused primarily by an increase in market yields required on these securities 
in  we recognized impairment of retained interests of million largely due to the compression of the spread on our residual securities 
servicing hedge losses the servicing hedge is designed to supplement the macro hedge and to offset a portion of the change in value of msrs and retained interests caused by changes in interest rates recorded in current period earnings

in a stable interest rate environment  we expect to incur no significant declines in value of msrs other than recovery of our investment through the realization of cash flows 
however  we expect to incur expenses related to the hedge costs 
the level of servicing hedge gains or losses in any period depends on various factors such as the size and composition of the hedge  the shape of the yield curve and the level of implied interest rate volatility

the increase in the provision for loan losses is due to the continuing growth and seasoning of the banking segment s loan portfolio  along with million of estimated losses incurred as a result of hurricane katrina 
the allowance for loan losses increased by from million at december   to million at december   primarily due to growth in loans held for investment at countrywide bank 
loan servicing fees and other income from msrs and retained interests loan servicing fees and other income from msrs and retained interests are summarized below years ended december  in thousands servicing fees  net of guarantee fees income from retained interests late charges prepayment penalties global operations segment subservicing fees ancillary fees total loan servicing fees and income from msrs and retained interests includes contractually specified servicing fees 
the increase in servicing fees  net of guarantee fees  was principally due to a increase in the average servicing portfolio  plus an increase in the overall annualized net service fee earned from of the average portfolio balance during to during the increase in income from retained interests was due primarily to a increase in the average investment in these assets 
this income excludes any impairment charges  which are included in recovery impairment of retained interests in the consolidated statement of earnings 
retained interests include interest only and principal only securities as well as residual interests that arise from the securitization of mortgage loans  particularly nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights we recorded amortization of msrs of  million  or an annual rate of  during as compared to  million  or an annual rate of  during the amortization rate of msrs is dependent on the forecasted prepayment speeds at the beginning of each quarter during the period 
on average  prevailing mortgage rates at the beginning of the quarterly periods during were slightly higher than in in addition  the average of the portfolio note rates was lower over the same period 
as a result  the average forecasted prepayment speeds were lower in the current period 
this resulted in a lower amortization rate for than in dollar amortization was higher because the msr asset balance was higher during recovery impairment of mortgage servicing rights during  we recovered previously recorded impairment of msrs of million  compared to impairment of million in total recovery of msrs during resulted from an increase in the estimated fair value of msrs resulting primarily from the increase in mortgage interest rates during the period 
msr impairment in resulted generally from a decrease in the msrs estimated fair value driven by a slight decrease in mortgage rates during the period 
impairment of retained interests in and we recognized impairment of retained interests of million and million  respectively  resulting from a decline in the value of such securities 
the collateral underlying certain of these residuals is fixed rate for a defined period of time while the pass through rate is floating 
an increase in projected short term interest rates during both periods caused compression of the spread on such residuals  which resulted in a decline in their value 
servicing hedge losses the servicing hedge generated losses of million and million during and  respectively 
during these losses resulted from increases in long term treasury and swap rates and mortgage rates as well as the decay in option time value 
during the losses primarily resulted from the decay in option time value as long term treasury and swap rates remained substantially unchanged 
net insurance premiums earned the increase in net insurance premiums earned of million was primarily due to an increase in premiums earned on the voluntary homeowners and auto lines of business and in reinsurance premiums earned

compensation expenses increased in most other business segments and corporate areas  reflecting growth in the company 
incremental direct costs associated with the origination of loans are deferred when incurred 
subsequent treatment of these costs is based on whether the loans are held for sale or held for investment 
if the loan is sold  the costs deferred are included as a component of gain on sale  if the loan is held for investment  the deferred costs are amortized to interest income over the life of the loan

the overall objective of the company s interest rate risk management activities is to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
the company manages price risk through the natural counterbalance of its loan production and servicing businesses 
the company also uses various financial instruments  including derivatives  to manage price risk related specifically to the values of its irlc  mortgage loans and mbs held by the company pending sale mortgage loan inventory  msrs and retained interests and trading securities  as well as a portion of its debt 
the company manages interest rate risk in its banking segment by funding the segment s interest earning assets with liabilities of similar duration or a combination of derivative instruments and certain liabilities that create repricing characteristics that more closely reflect the repricing behaviors of those assets than the liabilities alone 
interest rate lock commitments and mortgage inventory we are exposed to price risk relative to our mortgage loan inventory and our irlcs 
the mortgage loan inventory is comprised of mortgage loans held pending sale  and is presently held for an average of approximately days 
irlcs guarantee the rate and points on the underlying mortgage or group of mortgages for a specified period  generally from seven to days 
with regard to loans held for sale  we are exposed to price risk from the time an irlc is made to a mortgage applicant or financial intermediary to the time the resulting mortgage loan is sold 
for loans held for investment  we are exposed to price risk from the time an irlc is made to a financial intermediary to the time the loan is purchased 
during these periods  the company is exposed to losses if mortgage rates rise  because the value of the irlc or mortgage loan held for sale declines 
to manage this price risk the company uses derivatives 
managing the interest rate risk related to irlcs is complicated by the fact that the ultimate percentage of applications that close within the terms of the irlc is beyond our control and is driven primarily by changes in mortgage rates in the marketplace 
in general  the percentage of applications that ultimately close within the terms of the irlc increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicants committed rates 
the closing percentage is also influenced by the source and age of the applications  purpose for the loans purchase or refinance and the application approval rate 
we have developed closing ratio estimates using historical experience that take into account all of these variables  as well as renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
those closing ratios are used to estimate the aggregate balance of loans that we expect to fund within the terms of the irlcs 
our closing ratio estimates are revised periodically 
to manage the price risk associated with irlcs  we generally use a combination of net forward sales of mbs and put and call options on mbs  us treasury futures and eurodollar futures 
we generally enter into forward sales contracts of mbs in an amount equal to the portion of the irlcs expected to close  assuming no change in mortgage rates 
we acquire put and call options to protect against the variability of the rate of loan closings caused by changes in mortgage rates 
to manage credit spread risk associated with our irlcs  we may enter into credit default swaps 
we manage the price risk related to our mortgage loan inventory primarily by entering into forward sales of mbs and eurodollar futures contracts 
the value of these forward mbs sales and eurodollar futures moves in the opposite direction of the value of the mortgage loan inventory 
to manage credit spread risk associated with our mortgage loan inventory  we may enter into credit default swaps 
we manage the price risk and credit risk related to our commercial mortgage loans using interest rate swaps  total rate of return and credit default swaps 
we actively manage the risk profiles of our irlcs and mortgage loan inventory on a daily basis 
a more detailed description of the derivative instruments we use in our risk management activities related to the irlcs and mortgage loan inventory is presented below forward sales of mbs an obligation to sell mbs at a specified price on a specified date in the future

short eurodollar futures contracts a standardized exchange traded contract  the value of which is tied to spot eurodollar rates at specified future dates 
the value increases when eurodollar rates rise 
interest rate floors represents a right to receive cash if a reference interest rate falls below a contractual strike rate  therefore  its value increases as the reference interest rate falls 
the reference interest rates used in the company s interest rate floors include mortgage rates  treasury rates and us dollar usd libor 
total rate of return swaps an agreement to pay or receive the total return on a financial index or security in exchange for the payment or receipt of a floating rate of interest over the term of the contract 
for use in the risk management of the commercial mortgage portfolio  the company pays the return on a published cmbs index and receives the floating rate of interest 
the value of these contracts increases as the value of the index declines 
credit default swaps an agreement to purchase credit event protection based on a financial index or security in exchange for paying a fixed fee or premium over the term of the contract 
for use in the risk management primarily of commercial mortgage loans  the company receives credit protection and pays a fixed fee or premium 
the value of these contracts increases when the probability of the occurrence of a credit event rises 
mortgage servicing rights msrs and retained interests our msrs and retained interests are generally subject to loss in value when mortgage rates decline 
declining mortgage rates normally precipitate increased mortgage refinancing activity 
increased refinancing activity reduces the life of the loans underlying the msrs and retained interests  thereby reducing their value 
reductions in the value of these assets impact earnings primarily through change in fair value and impairment charges 
to moderate the effect on earnings caused by a rate driven decline in fair value  we maintain a portfolio of financial instruments  including derivatives  which generally increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline the servicing hedge 
we use the following financial instruments in our servicing hedge interest rate floors a right to receive cash if a reference interest rate falls below a contractual strike rate

these contracts increase in value as rates rise 
mortgage forward rate agreement a mutual agreement to exchange a single cash flow at a forward settlement date  based on the basis point difference between the forward fixed rate and floating rate set equal to the day forward current coupon mortgage rate  known as the constant mortgage maturity index  on the settlement date 
for use in the servicing hedge  we generally receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate 
such contracts increase in value as the spread between the current coupon mortgage rate and the swap curve tightens  or when interest rates fall 
interest rate caps a right to receive cash if a reference interest rate rises above a contractual strike rate 
the value increases as the reference interest rate rises 
the reference interest rates used in the company s interest rate caps include mortgage rates  us treasury rates and usd libor 
these instruments are combined to manage the overall risk profile of the msrs and retained interests 
we actively manage our msr and retained interests risk profile on a daily basis 
securities trading activities within our capital markets operations  we maintain a trading portfolio of fixed income securities  primarily mbs 
we are exposed to price changes in our trading portfolio arising from interest rate changes during the period we hold the securities 
to manage this risk  we use the following derivative instruments forward sales of to be announced tba mbs an obligation to sell at a specified price on a specified date in the future  agency pass through mbs that have not yet been issued

banking operations the primary component of the earnings of our banking operations is net interest income from our mortgage loan and securities investment portfolios 
in our banking operations  we invest primarily in adjustable rate and short duration residential mortgages 
our securities portfolio is comprised primarily of short duration sequential collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mbs 
we manage our interest rate risk primarily by matching our short duration assets with interest bearing liabilities that have similar duration and re pricing characteristics 
deposits are priced to encourage consumers to choose maturity terms consistent with our assets 
interest rate swaps are also used to efficiently and cost effectively modify the repricing characteristics of our liabilities to be more closely aligned with our interest earning assets 
long term debt and deposit liabilities management s objective in financing the activities of the company is to ensure access to reliable and cost effective funding from a variety of sources in order to meet the company s financing requirements under various market conditions 
these financing activities subject the company to interest rate risk 
specifically  the company is exposed to the risk that the interest expense it incurs on its long term borrowings will change at a different speed than the income it earns on the assets financed by the long term debt  contributing to variability of net interest income earnings 
to address this risk  management seeks long term debt structured to reprice in a manner similar to the assets it is financing 
however  the company may not be able to obtain access to borrowings structured to match the repricing characteristics of the assets being financed at optimal interest rates ie  cost 
management addresses this constraint  in part  by entering into interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements designed to modify the structure of its borrowings 
these agreements have the effect of changing the structure of a debt agreement to one that approximates the repricing characteristics of the assets financed 
impact of changes in interest rates on the net value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments and msrs we perform various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses incorporate assumed changes in the interest rate environment  including selected hypothetical  instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
we employ various commonly used modeling techniques to value our financial instruments in connection with these sensitivity analyses 
for mortgage loans  mbs  mbs forward contracts  collateralized mortgage obligations  interest only securities and msrs  option adjusted spread oas models are used 
the primary assumptions used in these models for the purpose of these sensitivity analyses are the prepayment speeds and implied market volatility of interest rates 
for options and interest rate floors  an option pricing model is used 
the primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates 
retained interests  with the exception of interest only securities  are valued using a zero volatility discounted cash flow model 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment rates  discount rates and credit losses 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value of our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments as of december   given several hypothetical  instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve change in fair value change in interest rate basis points in millions msrs and financial instruments msr and retained interests impact of servicing hedge mortgage based swap based treasury based msrs and retained interests  net interest rate lock commitments mortgage loan inventory impact of associated derivative instruments mortgage based us treasury based eurodollar based interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loan inventory  net banking operations securities portfolio mortgage loans held for investment deposit liabilities federal home loan bank advances countrywide bank  net notes payable and capital securities impact of associated derivative instruments swap based notes payable and capital securities  net insurance company investment portfolios net change in fair value related to msrs and financial instruments net change in fair value related to broker dealer trading securities the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments as of december   given selected hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve change in fair value change in interest rate basis points in millions net change in fair value related to msrs and financial instruments net change in fair value related to broker dealer trading securities these sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed at a particular point in time  are based on the hedge position in place at that particular point in time  only contemplate certain movements in interest rates  do not incorporate changes in interest rate volatility or changes in the relationship of one interest rate index to another  are subject to the accuracy of various assumptions used  including prepayment forecasts and discount rates  and do not incorporate other factors that would impact the company s overall financial performance in such scenarios  most significantly the impact of changes in loan production earnings that result from changes in interest rates 
not all of the changes in fair value would affect current period earnings 
for example  changes in fair value of securities accounted for as available for sale securities are recognized as a component of shareholders equity  net of income taxes  and our debt is carried at its unpaid balances net of issuance discount or premium 
absent hedge accounting  changes in the market value of our debt are not recorded in current period earnings 
for these reasons  the preceding estimates should not be viewed as an earnings forecast 
market risk foreign currency risk to diversify our funding sources on a global basis  we issue medium term notes denominated in foreign currency in addition to us dollars 
we manage the associated foreign currency risk through cross currency swap transactions 
the terms of the cross currency swaps have the effect of converting all foreign currency denominated medium term notes into us dollar obligations  thereby eliminating the associated foreign currency risk 
as a result  potential changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies denominating such medium term notes would not have a net financial impact on future earnings  fair values or cash flows 
credit risk management credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or an institution to honor its contractual obligations to us 
credit risk arises in many of our business activities including lending activities  securities trading activities and interest rate risk management activities 
we actively manage credit risk to maintain credit losses within levels that achieve our profitability and return on capital objectives while meeting our expectations for consistent financial performance 
management s credit committee  comprised of our chief risk officer and other senior executives  has primary responsibility for setting strategies to achieve our credit risk goals and objectives 
those goals and objectives are documented in our credit policy 
mortgage credit risk overview in our mortgage lending activities  we manage our credit risk through credit policy  underwriting  quality control and surveillance activities as well as through use of credit enhancements  especially nonrecourse and limited recourse securitizations 
we also employ proactive collection and loss mitigation efforts 
loan quality our credit policy establishes standards for the determination of acceptable credit risks 
those standards encompass borrower and collateral quality  underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards and procedures 
borrower quality includes consideration of the borrower s credit and capacity to pay 
we assess credit and capacity to pay through the use of credit scores  application of a mortgage scorecard  and manual or automated underwriting 
we evaluate collateral quality through the use of appraisals  property inspections and or automated valuation model 
underwriting guidelines facilitate the uniform application of underwriting standards to all borrowers regardless of race  religion or ethnic background 
uniformity in underwriting also provides a means for measuring and managing credit risk 
our conventional conforming underwriting guidelines are based on the guidelines accepted by fannie mae and freddie mac 
our underwriting guidelines for fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans comply with guidelines established by the us department of housing and urban development or the veterans administration 
our underwriting guidelines for non conforming mortgage loans  prime home equity loans  and nonprime mortgage loans have been designed so that these loans are salable in the secondary mortgage market 
we developed these guidelines to meet the requirements of private investors  rating agencies and third party credit enhancement providers 
these standards and procedures encompass underwriter qualifications and authority levels  appraisal review requirements  fraud controls  funds disbursement controls  training of our employees and ongoing review of their work 
we help to ensure that our origination standards are met by employing accomplished and seasoned management  underwriters and processors and through the extensive use of technology 
we also employ proprietary underwriting systems in our loan origination process that improve the consistency of underwriting standards  assess collateral adequacy and help to prevent fraud  while at the same time increasing productivity 
we supplement our loan origination standards and procedures with a post funding quality control process 
our quality control department is responsible for completing loan audits that may consist of a re verification of loan documentation  an underwriting and appraisal review  and  if necessary  a fraud investigation 
we also employ a pre and post funding proprietary loan performance evaluation system 
this system helps to identify fraud and poor performance of individuals and business entities associated with the origination of our loans 
the combination of this system and our audit results allows us to evaluate and measure adherence to prescribed underwriting guidelines and compliance with laws and regulations 
sale of loans nearly all of the mortgage loans that we originate or purchase in our mortgage banking and capital markets segments are sold into the secondary mortgage market primarily in the form of securities  and to a lesser extent as whole loans 
in connection with such sales  we have liability under the representations and warranties we make to purchasers and insurers of the loans 
in the event of a breach of such representations and warranties  we may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans with the identified defects or indemnify the investor or insurer 
in such cases  we bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans 
our representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits 
however  our contractual liability arises only when the representations and warranties are breached 
we attempt to limit our risk of incurring these losses by structuring our operations to ensure consistent production of quality mortgages and servicing those mortgages at levels that meet or exceed secondary mortgage market standards 
we make significant investments in personnel and technology to ensure the quality of our mortgage loan production 
the liability for this recourse resulting from a breach of our representations and warranties totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in this liability is due mainly to the addition of the liabilities related to securitizations in the current period together with an increase in loan sales  which generally have more extensive representations and warranties than securitizations 
the expense of million  million and million for  and  respectively  associated with the liability for representations and warranties was recorded as a component of gain on sale of loans in the consolidated income statement 
we generally sell our prime mortgage loans on a non recourse basis  either in the form of securities or as loans 
in addition  we may sell a portion of our nonprime and prime home equity loans on a non recourse basis in the form of whole loans 
securitization as described below  the degree to which we retain credit risk on loans that we sell through securitizations depends on the structure of the securitization 
our prime mortgage loans generally are securitized on a non recourse basis  while prime home equity and nonprime mortgage loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for credit losses 
conforming conventional loans we generally pool conforming conventional loans into mbs guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac 
subject to certain representations and warranties we make  nearly all conventional loans securitized through fannie mae or freddie mac are sold on a non recourse basis 
we pay guarantee fees to these agencies to compensate them for their assumption of credit risk on the securitized loans 
fha insured and va guaranteed loans fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans are generally pooled into mbs guaranteed by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae 
we are insured against foreclosure loss by the fha or partially guaranteed against foreclosure loss by the va 
fees charged by the fha and va for assuming such risks are paid directly by the borrower 
we are exposed to credit losses on defaulted va loans to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the va is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred 
we pay guarantee fees to ginnie mae for ginnie mae s guarantee on its securities of timely payment of principal and interest 
ginnie mae does not assume mortgage credit risk associated with the loans securitized under its program 
non conforming conventional prime loans non conforming conventional prime mortgage loans are generally pooled into private label non agency mbs 
such securitizations involve some form of credit enhancement such as senior subordinated structures  including residual interests  overcollateralization or mortgage pool insurance 
securitizations that involve senior subordinated structures contain securities that assume varying levels of credit risk 
holders of subordinated securities are compensated for the credit risk assumed through a higher yield 
when we sell the subordinated securities created in connection with these securitizations we transfer the related credit risk subject to representations and warranties we make when the loans are securitized 
when we retain the subordinated securities  generally the residual interests  we are in the first loss position  however  the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the residual securities 
in some cases a portion of the retained residual interest is deposited into a net interest margin nim security  which enables us to sell some of the future residual cash flows and retain a smaller residual interest back end nim residual 
the holder of the back end nim residual is in the first loss position  however  the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the back end nim residual 
prime home equity loans prime home equity loans are generally pooled into private label asset backed securities 
we generally securitize these loans with limited recourse for credit losses through retention of residual interests and other subordinated interests  such as transferor s interests 
we  as the holder of the residual interest are in the first loss position  however  the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the residual interest 
these securities generally contain credit enhancement in the form of over collateralization and guarantees provided by a third party surety 
in some cases  the securitizations also contain mortgage pool insurance or a limited corporate guarantee as a form of credit enhancement 
nonprime mortgage loans nonprime mortgage loans are generally pooled into private label asset backed securities 
we generally securitize these loans with limited recourse for credit losses through retention of residual interests  the value of which ranges from to of the principal balance of the loans 
the holder of the residual interest is in the first loss position  however  the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the residual interest 
in some cases  such limited recourse securitizations have contained lender paid mortgage insurance as a form of credit enhancement or a limited corporate guarantee from us 
we also have pooled a portion of our nonprime mortgage loans into securities guaranteed by fannie mae 
in such cases  we have paid fannie mae a guarantee fee in exchange for fannie mae assuming a portion of the credit risk of the underlying loans 
in some cases a portion of the retained residual interest is deposited into a net interest margin nim security  which enables us to sell some of the future residual cash flows and retain a smaller residual interest back end nim residual 
the value of the back end nim residuals ranges from to of the principal balance of the loans underlying the residual security 
the holder of the back end nim residual is in the first loss position  however  the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the back end nim residual 
our exposure to credit losses related to our recourse securitization activities is limited to the carrying value of our subordinated interests and to the contractual limit of reimbursable losses under our corporate guarantees less the recorded liability for such guarantees 
these amounts are as follows december  in thousands subordinated interests prime home equity residual securities prime home equity line of credit transferor s interests nonprime residual securities prime residual securities subordinated mortgage backed pass through securities corporate guarantees in excess of recorded liability expected future credit losses are considered in the determination of the fair value of the subordinated interests 
the total credit losses incurred for  and related to all of our mortgage loan sales activities are summarized as follows years ended december  in thousands nonprime and prime securitizations with retained residual interest repurchased or indemnified loans prime home equity securitizations with retained residual interest nonprime securitizations with corporate guarantee prime home equity securitizations with corporate guarantee va losses in excess of va guarantee portfolio lending activities in our banking segment  our portfolio of loans held for investment includes mortgage loans originated or purchased for investment purposes and mortgage loan warehouse lending advances 
in our mortgage banking segment  loans held for investment include mortgage loans repurchased due to violations of representations and warranties  government guaranteed or insured loans repurchased from ginnie mae securitizations in lieu of continuing to advance delinquent principal and interest installments to security holders  and loans transferred from loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value 
mortgage loans originated or purchased for investment our portfolio of mortgage loans originated or purchased for investment is held in our banking operations 
banking operations manages credit risk through the establishment of underwriting standards  which include assessing both a borrower s quality and the adequacy of collateral securing the loan 
the various positive and negative factors presented in a loan application are balanced in the assessment of the acceptability of the loan s risk to us 
for example  a borrower with a very strong credit rating may present a superior credit risk  even if the proposed loan includes a high loan to value ratio 
conversely  a borrower who presents a weaker credit rating  but who is applying for a loan with a low loan to value ratio  may also present a positive credit risk 
our banking operations portfolio of loans held for investment is summarized below december  unpaid principal balance average note rate average original fico score average original combined loan to value ratio dollars in thousands mortgage loans pay option arms hybrid arms helocs fixed rate seconds fixed rate firsts other arms total mortgage loans warehouse lending advances secured by mortgage loans commercial real estate total loans purchase premiums and discounts and deferred loan origination fees and costs  net allowance for loan losses banking operations portfolio of loans held for investment a commonly used measure of consumer creditworthiness is the borrower s fico score  a measure of borrower creditworthiness developed by fair isaac corporation and used by many lenders  including countrywide  to assess a prospective borrower s credit history and the impact of the prospect s current borrowing arrangements on their ability to repay a loan 
borrowers can be assigned a fico score of between least creditworthy and most creditworthy based on their payment history  current indebtedness  length of credit history  recently established credit and types of credit used 
the following is a breakdown of banking operations portfolio of residential mortgage loans held for investment by original fico score bands december  original fico score unpaid principal balance in thousands below as discussed above  we assess a loan s quality by considering the borrower s credit profile and the quality of collateral securing the loan 
where a proposed loan s combined loan to value ratio is higher than a specified level  which is usually for conventional loans  we generally require the borrower to supplement the collateral with primary mortgage insurance 
in addition  we have taken steps in recent years to credit enhance our investment loan portfolio by acquiring supplemental mortgage insurance coverage 
prior to  such coverage provided protection on second lien mortgages only 
during  we began purchasing coverage on first lien pay option arms as well 
as of december   billion of banking operations residential loan portfolio was covered by supplemental mortgage insurance purchased by the bank on specified pools of loans 
the maximum coverage available under these policies on a combined basis is million 
while these policies provide for first loss coverage  some bank purchased policies require premium adjustments if claims exceed specified levels 
furthermore  coverage limits vary by policy  with some policies having limits at the pool level  and others at the loan level 
following is a summary of our banking operations residential mortgage loans  together with applicable mortgage insurance  by original combined loan to value ratio at december  december  original combined loan to value unpaid principal balance upb with lender purchased mortgage insurance upb with borrower purchased mortgage insurance in thousands these amounts may include loans with borrower paid mortgage insurance 
subsequent to december   we acquired additional policies such that the specific pools of loans aggregating billion are covered under supplemental mortgage insurance with a maximum available coverage under all polices of million as of february  while we make loans on a nationwide basis  our portfolio of residential mortgage loans originated for investment purposes is concentrated in the states of california  florida and virginia at december  as shown in the following table state unpaid principal balance total balance in thousands california southern northern florida virginia all other states total a significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of pay option arm loans 
these loans are different than traditional loans in that they may allow paying less than full interest payments thereby increasing the loan balance in the early periods of a loan s life 
while we believe that we have prudently underwritten these loans  such loans present additional risks 
pay option arm loans have interest rates that adjust monthly and contain features that allow the borrower to defer making the full interest payment for at least the first year of the loan 
after this option period  minimum monthly payments increase by no more than per year unless the unpaid balance increases to a specified limit  which is no more than of the original loan amount  at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established 
to ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan  the fully amortizing loan payment amount is re established after either five or ten years and again every five years thereafter 
due to the lack of significant historical experience at countrywide  the credit performance of these loans has not been established for the company 
due to pay option arm loans amortization characteristics  the loss that the company would realize in the event of default may be higher than that realized on a traditional loan that does not provide for deferral of a portion of the fully amortizing loan payment 
countrywide s pay option arm loans are designed with features that address the risk of borrower default and the increased risk of loss in the event of default 
specifically  countrywide s underwriting standards conform to those required to make the pay option arm loans salable into the secondary market at the date of funding  including a requirement that the borrower meet secondary market debt service ratio tests based on their making the fully amortizing loan payment assuming the loan s interest rate is fully indexed 
a fully indexed loan rate equals the sum of the current index rate plus the margin applicable to the loan 
the loans terms limit the amount of potential increase of loss in the event of default by restricting the amount of interest that may be added to the loan s balance as described in the preceding paragraph 
in addition  we address the increased risk through active written communication with our borrowers including brochures explaining the loan to prospective borrowers welcome brochures sent to new borrowers informing them of the risk of habitually making minimum monthly payments specialized monthly statements with extensive information on the loan  including a reminder that making less than the minimum payment can increase the loan s balance warning notices to borrowers whose loan balances have increased past certain levels  informing the borrower how much their payment will increase if their payment pattern continues

the ratio of the lower of the amount of all loans secured by the property to the original appraised value or purchase price of the property 
a fico score is a measure of borrower creditworthiness determined using a statistical model 
fico scores range from approximately to  with a higher score indicating an individual with a more favorable credit profile 
the increase in delinquency is due to seasoning of the pay option arm loan portfolio 
management expects the delinquency rate in the company s pay option arm loan portfolio to increase as this product continues to season 
as discussed in the business regulation interagency guidance on residential mortgage products section of this report  pay option arm loans are subject to regulatory underwriting and borrower disclosure requirements 
the impact of this guidance on the industry and us is uncertain at this time 
nonperforming assets comprised of non accrual loans and foreclosed assets and the allowance for loan losses related to mortgage loans originated or purchased for investment at period end are summarized as follows december  december  amount of banking operations assets amount of banking operations assets dollar amounts in thousands nonaccrual loans residential foreclosed real estate residential total nonperforming assets amount of nonaccrual loans amount of nonaccrual loans allowances for credit losses allowance for loan losses residential liability for unfunded loan commitments total allowances for credit losses year ended december  year ended december  amount net charge offs as average investment loans amount net charge offs as average investment loans net charge offs banking operations the increase in our nonperforming assets and the increase in the allowance for loans losses from reflect prevailing real estate market and economic conditions and the growth and seasoning of our investment loan portfolio 
we expect the level of nonperforming assets and credit losses to increase  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our loan portfolio as our loan portfolio continues to season and as current market conditions develop 
however  we believe that our investment criteria have provided us with a high quality investment portfolio and that our credit losses should stay within acceptable levels 
we also believe our allowances and provisions for credit losses are adequate pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles 
the provision for loan losses and the related allowance for loan losses is affected by many factors  including economic conditions for example  housing prices  interest rates and unemployment rates  the borrower s credit profile  the loan s payment requirements  and loan seasoning and prepayments 
mortgage warehouse lending advances we hold a portfolio of commercial loans made to other mortgage lenders to finance their inventories pending sale to countrywide and other lenders 
the average loan balance was million at december  these loans are underwritten by assessing the creditworthiness of the borrowers 
the borrowers ability to repay their loans is assessed by reviewing both borrower provided financial information and publicly available credit rating information and press coverage  as well as updating operational controls  product risk and assessments of collateral 
we monitor the length of time that advances are outstanding against specific loans and may require the borrower to pay off aged advances 
we also monitor the fair value of our collateral to ensure that the level of collateral posted is adequate to repay our advance in the event of default by our borrower and we may require our warehouse lending borrowers to post specified levels of cash collateral to supplement the mortgage loan collateral 
we also regularly review updated financial information of borrowers  including pipeline and hedging positions 
other mortgage loans held for investment other loans held for investment are held in our mortgage banking segment and include loans we have repurchased either to remedy a violation of a representation or warranty made in a loan sale  to minimize the cost of servicing a severely delinquent loan insured or partially guaranteed by the fha or va or in connection with a clean up call 
we make provisions for losses that may arise from breaches of representations and warranties when we record the sale of these loans and we adjust our estimates for losses on these loans quarterly 
we record such loans at fair value when they are repurchased and any resulting loss is charged against the liability we established when the loans were sold 
in addition  we may determine that a small percentage of the loans that we originate or purchase for sale will not be sold because of a defect  which may include a document deficiency or deterioration of the credit status of the loan while it was held for sale 
such loans are transferred to the held for investment category at the lower of cost or fair value and any loss is recorded as a component of gain on sale of loans or securities in current period earnings 
subsequent losses that may result from deteriorations in the credit quality of the loans are included in our provision for loan losses 
mortgage loans held for sale at december   mortgage loans held for sale amounted to billion 
while the loans are in inventory of the mortgage banking and capital markets segments  we bear credit risk after taking into consideration primary mortgage insurance which is generally required for conventional loans with a loan to value ratio greater than  fha insurance or va guarantees 
these loans are carried at lower of cost or market value  which incorporates a reduction in value for impaired loans 
a small portion of loans held for sale have been placed on nonaccrual status 
this includes distressed loans that are generally purchased at a discount as part of the conduit activities of the capital markets segment and loans whose credit quality has deteriorated during the time that they have been held for sale 
nonperforming assets  which includes loans held for investment other than those originated or purchased for investment and loans held for sale that have been placed on nonaccrual  foreclosed assets  and the related allowance for loan losses are summarized as follows december  december  amount amount dollar amounts in thousands non accrual loans residential loans held for investment credit risk retained by countrywide commercial total non accrual loans foreclosed real estate other residential commercial total foreclosed real estate total nonperforming assets amount of nonaccrual loans amount of nonaccrual loans allowances for loan losses residential commercial n m n m n m n m year ended december  year ended december  amount net charge offs as average investment loans amount net charge offs as average investment loans net charge offs mortgage banking other excludes  million and million  at december  and  respectively  of government insured loans eligible for repurchase which are required to be included in our balance sheets but which we have not exercised the option to repurchase 
excludes nonaccrual loans that are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or fair value and government guaranteed loans held for investment  as shown below december  in thousands loans held for sale government guaranteed loans  held for investment generally these loans have been repurchased and recorded at fair value or transferred to held for investment at lower of cost or fair value 
fair values incorporate the impaired status at the date of repurchase of the loans 
losses related to subsequent deterioration in the credit quality of the loans are recorded in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses excludes any reduction to the cost basis of loans recorded to reflect fair value at repurchase or transfer to held for investment 
the decrease in the allowance for loan losses from is due mainly to a reduction in the allowance requirements for loans held for investment in the mortgage banking segment 
the reduction in the allowance requirements in the mortgage banking segment is the result of liquidation or write down and transfer of loans to held for sale as evidenced by the increase in charge offs during as of december   the majority of the loans held for investment had charge offs that were recorded in  reflecting credit impairment included in their carrying values 
as a result  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming assets decreased from to mortgage reinsurance we provide mortgage reinsurance on certain mortgage loans included in our servicing portfolio through contracts with several primary mortgage insurance companies 
under these contracts  we provide aggregate excess loss coverage in a mezzanine layer in exchange for a portion of the pools mortgage insurance premium 
as of december   approximately billion of mortgage loans in our servicing portfolio are covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance contracts place limits on our maximum exposure to losses 
at december   the maximum aggregate losses under the reinsurance contracts were limited to million 
we are required to pledge securities to cover this potential liability 
for the years ended december  and  we did not experience any losses under our reinsurance contracts 
we recorded provisions for losses related to this activity of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the accumulated liability recorded for estimated reinsurance totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
counterparty credit risk we have exposure to credit loss in the event of contractual non performance by our trading counterparties and counterparties to our various over the counter derivative financial instruments 
we manage this credit risk by selecting only counterparties we believe to be financially strong  spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties  by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty and by entering into netting agreements with the counterparties  as appropriate 
the aggregate amount of counterparty credit exposure after consideration of relevant netting agreements at december   before and after collateral held by us  was as follows december  in millions aggregate credit exposure before collateral held less collateral held net aggregate unsecured credit exposure for the years ended december   and we incurred no credit losses due to non performance of any of our counterparties 
operational risk all businesses face operational risk  which is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems or from external events 
cfc categorizes operational risk into the areas of human resources  vendor management  custody of assets  accounting and financial disclosure  technology  physical security  natural hazard and environment  fraud and embezzlement internal and external  political and governmental affairs  modeling  compliance  regulatory and governance 
cfc has documented its operational risks and corresponding controls in its proprietary risk and control assessment system 
currently  operational risks and  corresponding controls are documented in this system 
this information is utilized by executive officers and appropriate governance groups within the company for ongoing risk assessment  monitoring  testing and review 
responsibility for operational risk identification and management is assigned to each of our business units with centralized corporate oversight and support 
operational risk management is embedded into our daily activities 
examples include identification of operational risk is performed at the activity level 
key controls that address the risks are identified and monitored by management 
operational controls that affect financial reporting are also tested by business unit management independent testing and evaluation of internal controls is conducted on a sample basis by our internal audit function review of corporate processes and operational risks including the sufficiency of governance structures to mitigate those risks is conducted by an independent enterprise risk assessment function staff is dedicated to specific areas of key operational risk mitigation  such as a disaster recovery  central compliance oversight and fraud risk management oversight of operational risk on an enterprise wide basis is conducted by countrywide s operational risk committee comprised of senior cfc executives  a risk managers roundtable comprised of divisional operation risk managers  and on a divisional basis  by business unit risk committees comprised of the business unit s leaders and risk managers the processes supporting our key business activities are evaluated and redesigned as needed in a structured manner that minimizes errors and improves efficiency a corporate expectation of ethical behavior is set with a formalized code of ethics  mandatory annual compliance training  provision for anonymous reporting of suspected breaches of corporate ethics  and independent monitoring by and reporting of alleged breaches of corporate ethics to the audit and ethics committee of the board of directors 
loan servicing the following table sets forth certain information regarding our servicing portfolio of single family mortgage loans  including loans held for sale  loans held for investment and loans serviced under subservicing agreements  for the periods indicated

we attribute the overall increase in delinquencies in our servicing portfolio primarily to portfolio seasoning  changing economic and housing market conditions and increased delinquency in the loans in hurricane affected areas  which contributed basis points to the increase 
in addition  changing borrower profiles and higher combined loan to value ratios contributed to the increased nonprime delinquency 
we believe the delinquency rates in our servicing portfolio are consistent with rates for similar mortgage loan portfolios in the industry 
inflation our operations that would be most significantly impacted by an increase in inflation are our mortgage banking and capital markets segments 
interest rates normally increase during periods of rising inflation 
historically  as interest rates increase  mortgage loan production decreases 
an environment of gradual interest rate increases may  however  signify an improving economy or increasing real estate values  which in turn may stimulate increased home buying activity 
generally  in such periods of reduced mortgage loan production  the associated profit margins also decline due to increased competition among mortgage loan originators and to higher unit costs  thus further reducing our loan production earnings 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  our loan servicing earnings generally increase because mortgage prepayment rates tend to slow down  thereby extending the average life of our servicing portfolio and related msrs 
within our broker dealer operations  rising interest rates generally lead to a reduction in trading and underwriting activities in its primary niche  the mortgage securities market 
seasonality the mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends  reflecting the pattern in the national housing market 
home sales typically rise during the spring and summer seasons and decline during the fall and winter seasons 
seasonality has less of an effect on mortgage refinancing activity  which is primarily driven by prevailing mortgage rates 
in addition  mortgage delinquency rates typically rise temporarily in the winter months  driven by mortgagor payment patterns 
liquidity and capital resources we meet our financing requirements using a combination of debt and equity capital 
our short term financing needs arise primarily from our holding of mortgage loans pending sale  our warehouse lending business and the trading activities of our broker dealer 
our long term financing needs arise primarily from our investments in our mortgage loan portfolio  msrs and retained interests and the financial instruments acquired to manage the interest rate risk associated with those investments 
the structure and mix of our debt and equity capital are primarily driven by our strategic objectives but are also influenced by regulatory and credit rating agency requirements 
these requirements effect the type of financing we are able to obtain and the rate at which we are able to grow 
our primary sources of debt include the public corporate debt markets  the fhlb  the secondary mortgage market  repurchase agreements and deposits taken by our bank 
our primary source of equity capital is retained earnings 
we also have billion outstanding in junior subordinated debentures that receive varying degrees of equity treatment from rating agencies  bank lenders and regulators 
in addition  we have a billion deferred tax liability related to our msrs that would offset a portion of any potential loss in the value of our msrs  and which is generally offset against our msrs in determining our capital requirements 
from time to time  we may issue common stock  subordinated debt or other high equity content securities as a means of increasing our capital base and supporting our growth 
on november   in connection with a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors  we entered into an agreement to purchase million shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of billion under an accelerated share repurchase program 
the transaction is subject to a market price adjustment payment based on the actual volume weighted average price of our common stock during the repurchase period 
the price adjustment payment will be settled  at our election  in our common stock or cash 
the final settlement is expected to occur in the second quarter of liquidity management liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions 
we have developed a comprehensive liquidity management plan lmp to moderate this risk and ensure that we maintain adequate  appropriate and cost effective sources of liquidity under all market conditions 
a key element of the lmp is to finance our assets in a manner consistent with their liquidity profile 
liquid assets are those that can be liquidated within days under all market conditions either by sale at prices no less than values reported on our balance sheet prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or are readily able to be financed 
these assets primarily consist of mortgage loans held for sale  warehouse advance lines and trading securities 
liquid assets are financed using a combination of committed and uncommitted warehouse financing programs including unsecured commercial paper  asset backed commercial paper  federal funds  repurchase agreements and short term deposits 
less liquid assets are those that are not readily saleable into active markets 
these assets primarily consist of mortgage loans held for investment  msrs and retained interests 
less liquid assets are financed with long term capital  which we define for this purpose as equity and debt  including long term deposits  with a maturity greater than six months 
another key component of the lmp is the minimization of refinancing risk 
to that end  we manage our long term public debt maturities debt maturing after six months and committed credit facility expirations to limit the amount maturing in any given month 
we also manage the timing of our short term debt maturities to limit the amount maturing on any given day 
we diversify our financing programs  credit providers  dealers and debt investors to reduce reliance upon any one source of liquidity 
finally  we assess all sources of financing based upon their reliability  recognizing that certain of our financing programs are sensitive to temporary market disruptions and therefore may not always be available to us 
to moderate that risk  we pay commitment fees to some of our creditors to ensure access to certain funds regardless of market conditions 
to ensure compliance with the lmp  chl  csc  and countrywide bank are required to maintain adequate liquidity to operate in a normal environment  maintain adequate contingent liquidity regardless of conditions and to diversify funding sources 
each business unit has detailed metrics which are appropriate to its business line 
the metrics are compared with actual performance positions and reported to executive management monthly 
we regularly forecast our potential funding needs over a rolling twelve month horizon  taking into account debt maturities and potential peak balance sheet levels under several interest rate scenarios 
we also forecast our potential funding needs in various stress scenarios to determine our contingent liquidity needs 
based on these forecasts  we size our existing financing programs and  if necessary  establish new ones to meet expected future funding requirements 
the forecasts are also used to size our contingent liquidity sources  which are credit facilities or financing programs under which our creditors are committed to fund 
our sources of contingent liquidity include committed unsecured credit lines  committed revolving mortgage purchase agreements and secured fhlb advances 
at december   we had billion in available sources of secured and unsecured short term liquidity  of which billion is committed and therefore considered a source of contingent liquidity 
we also had billion of available borrowing capacity at the fhlb 
our long term debt typically consists of unsecured debt issued in the public corporate debt markets and secured term advances maturities greater than one year from the fhlb 
at december   we had billion in unsecured long term debt and billion of secured term fhlb advances outstanding 
see note notes payable in the financial statement section of this report for additional descriptions of our committed financing programs 
unsecured public corporate debt markets the public corporate debt markets are a key source of financing for us  due to their efficiency and low cost 
typically  we access these markets by issuing unsecured commercial paper and unsecured medium term notes 
we also have issued unsecured subordinated debt  convertible debt and junior subordinated debentures 
at december   we had a total of billion in public corporate debt outstanding 
to maintain our desired level of access to the public corporate debt markets  it is critical for us to maintain investment grade credit ratings 
we have consistently maintained investment grade credit ratings over the past years 
in  we sought and received investment grade credit ratings for countrywide bank as well 
given our current ratings  we generally have deep access to the public corporate debt markets 
current credit ratings are as follows countrywide financial corporation countrywide home loans countrywide bank rating agency short term long term short term long term short term long term standard poors a a a a a a moody s investors service p a p a p a fitch f a f a f a among other things  maintenance of our current investment grade ratings requires that we have high levels of liquidity  including access to alternative sources of funding such as committed stand by lines of credit provided by highly rated banks 
we must also maintain a conservative capital structure 
to mitigate the risk of ratings downgrades  we maintain an active dialogue with all three rating agencies  meeting throughout the year to review operational and financial performance and to address specific areas of focus 
in the event our credit ratings were to drop below investment grade  our access to the public corporate debt markets could be severely limited 
the cutoff for investment grade is generally considered to be a long term rating of bbb  or three gradations below our lowest current rating 
in the event of a ratings downgrade below investment grade  we could be required to rely upon alternative non public sources of financing  such as bank lines  increased fhlb advances and private debt placements secured and unsecured 
furthermore  we would likely be unable to retain all of our existing bank credit commitments beyond the then existing maturity dates 
as a consequence  our cost of financing would rise significantly and we may be required to curtail some of our capital intensive activities  such as our ongoing investment in our portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment  msrs and retained interests 
on the other hand  given the highly liquid nature of our mortgage inventory and broker dealer trading portfolio  we would likely be able to arrange secured financing for such assets 
over the long term  however  it would be difficult for us to compete effectively without investment grade ratings 
management believes the likelihood of a reduction in our credit ratings to below investment grade in the foreseeable future is remote 
asset backed commercial paper market an important source of funding for us is the asset backed commercial paper market 
this form of financing generally involves the temporary transfer of legal ownership of assets to a separate legal entity conduit in exchange for short term financing 
some financing programs have commercial bank sponsors that provide some form of liquidity support and or credit enhancement such as back up lines of credit 
other programs rely on market value swap contracts under which commercial banks provide protection against interest rate driven declines in values of assets transferred to a conduit 
investors that purchase secured debt  typically commercial paper  issued by these conduits look primarily to the collateral s asset value to ensure repayment  rather than to the credit standing of the company that utilizes the conduit for financing 
as such  we have been able to structure such programs so that they carry the highest short term credit ratings of a p which allows us to achieve lower funding costs 
we have used this market primarily to finance a significant portion of our mortgage loan inventory held for sale 
we use such programs as a cost effective means to expand and diversify our sources of liquidity 
at december   we had borrowed a total of billion through such asset backed financing programs 
federal home loan bank advances our bank is a member of the fhlb of atlanta and is able to participate in certain member financing programs 
under these programs  we typically pledge a security interest in certain mortgage loans to the fhlb in exchange for financing 
the amount the fhlb advances against the collateral varies depending on the lien status of the mortgages securing the advance 
the fhlb also requires that we purchase a certain percentage of its stock for every dollar we borrow 
our current stock purchase requirement is of total outstanding fhlb advances 
our fhlb advances generally have maturities of years  consistent with the weighted average expected life of our mortgage loans held for investment 
our access to such financing is limited to no more than of our bank s ending assets for the prior month 
the fhlb s financing support is uncommitted and requests for additional advances are evaluated at the time they are received 
while we normally consider uncommitted financing programs to be less reliable sources of funding  given the fhlb s status as a government sponsored entity and its mandate to provide a stable source of funds to support the residential mortgage market  we classify fhlb advances as a highly reliable source of contingent liquidity 
secondary mortgage market we rely substantially on the secondary mortgage market as a source of long term capital to support our mortgage banking operations 
most of the mortgage loans that we produce are sold in the secondary mortgage market  primarily in the form of mbs and abs 
significant portions of the mbs we sell are guaranteed by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae collectively  agency mbs 
we also issue non agency or private label mbs and abs 
private label mbs and abs are registered with the sec and have separate credit ratings 
private label mbs and abs generally require some form of credit enhancement  such as over collateralization  senior subordinated structures  primary mortgage insurance  countrywide guarantees and or private surety guarantees 
our strategy is to ensure our ongoing access to the secondary mortgage market by consistently producing quality mortgages and servicing those mortgages at levels that meet or exceed secondary mortgage market standards 
we are focused on ensuring the quality of our mortgage loan production and we make significant investments in personnel and technology to support the quality of our mortgage loan production 
repurchase agreements we also use short term repurchase agreements as a means of financing securities and mortgage loans pending sale 
although this method of financing is uncommitted and short term in nature  it has proven to be a reliable and cost effective financing alternative 
deposit liabilities we offer both retail and commercial deposit accounts which provide another source of liquidity to us 
these deposits are sourced through our banking centers  call centers  online and through deposit brokers 
as of december   our deposit balances were billion  billion of which were custodial funds that relate to our loan servicing portfolio 
a significant portion of our deposits are stable and are therefore considered to be core deposits 
capital management our capital management framework is designed to ensure that the risk taking activities by our business are supported by an adequate capital base  consistent with approved investment guidelines and risk tolerances 
our capital adequacy monitoring gives consideration to regulatory and rating agency requirements and to our estimated economic capital requirements 
economic capital we currently use economic capital concepts for assessing safety and soundness of the entire company 
we have integrated economic capital into business segment performance assessments 
business segment economic capital calculations ensure that the capital allocations are consistent  elicit disciplined risk taking  and facilitate business segment performance comparisons by senior management 
where possible  we have made conservative choices in our economic capital estimates  for example  market risk capital covers risks over time horizons longer than needed for risk management 
we define economic capital as the amount of capital required to absorb unexpected losses given our risk profile and risk management strategies 
we estimate unexpected losses based on the level of losses that we are likely to incur in severe scenarios 
we establish the severity of the scenarios based on our risk tolerances and target credit ratings for public debt market access debt market access standards 
for unhedged risks  our capital adequacy is assessed at the consolidated level  and take into account certain offsetting diversification benefits that arise across risks and business lines  where the benefits are determined to be robust 
we continue to refine our economic capital calculations and improve our estimates of required capital 
we emphasize a comprehensive measurement of company wide hedged and un hedged risks within the context of maintaining approved debt market access targets in our capital adequacy measurement processes 
our estimates of economic capital rely on a combination of internally developed risk measurement methods  external models and benchmarks 
we measure and hold economic capital for the following primary risks credit  market  operational  insurance and modeling 
credit risk this is risk of loss due to borrower defaults or declines in value due to changes in credit conditions 
credit capital is calculated at debt market access standards for the unexpected losses in excess of those we have provided for in our asset valuations and reserve calculations 
our credit risk loss estimation process considers the seasoning profile of our assets with credit risk to ensure capital sufficiency through the business cycle 
estimates of credit capital are developed separately for retail mortgage  commercial mortgage and counterparty exposures 
the amounts outstanding at the time of default exposures at default are constructed using a combination of historical data and forward simulation techniques and include the use of rating agency models that are broadly used in the mortgage backed securities market 
we estimate our credit risk as follows retail credit risk we base our estimates of credit risk on projections from internal data and external models 
we estimate subordination levels on the credit portfolio using rating agency models and review subordination levels on market transactions to determine the required capital 
we also review loss development under various stress scenarios to ensure adequacy of the capital requirement 
commercial credit risk we base our estimates of credit risk on internal data and benchmarks derived from market transactions 
counterparty credit risk for non derivative counterparty exposures  we base our estimates of credit risk on our internal risk evaluation assignments and capital assessments by type of exposure mapped to rating agency style scales 
we estimate our capital requirement for derivative counterparty exposures using a similar process as well as calculating current and potential exposure estimates using projected movements in underlying market rates 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss in value due to variations in underlying market variables such as the yield curve and market prices  which for us is predominately interest rate driven 
we assess capital separately for our trading financial instruments  which includes the activities of csc  and the non trading financial instruments by computing estimates of market value loss over a one year horizon at a confidence level consistent with our debt market access standards 
our assessments take into consideration the probabilities of large movements in underlying driver variables over the one year horizon 
our estimates of value loss are calculated using internally developed and externally sourced risk measurement technologies 
risk measurement focuses on estimating the extent of un hedged risks 
market value changes are also developed using plausible but unlikely scenarios and these scenarios are given consideration in the assessment of our market risk capital requirements 
trading financial instruments we use a value at risk measurement to estimate the potential loss in market value of an asset to a confidence level 
our value at risk measure facilitates comparisons of our market risk exposure estimates and our daily trading results over time 
we use back testing in our trading unit to verify the predictive power of our value at risk calculations 
in the back testing procedures  we compare actual profits and losses against losses indicated by the estimates from our value at risk model 
during calendar year  we had no back testing exceptions 
non trading financial instruments we compute the aggregate market risk exposure for our non trading financial instruments by developing a detailed representation of our positions  and identification and modeling of the driver variables 
we calculate market risk capital for the aggregated non trading book by computing the equivalent of a one year value at risk loss estimate consistent with debt market access standards 
for risk management purposes  value at risk loss measurements are computed over monthly horizons and a market risk profile consistent with desired debt market access standards is maintained 
during calendar year  the company s year value at risk loss estimates were well within the operating limits 
we look at the sensitivity of the non trading financial instruments in a variety of parallel and historical scenarios to assess the vulnerabilities in the risk profile 
stress testing while our value at risk estimate supplies forecasts for potentially large losses under normal market conditions  we also perform stress tests in which we value the portfolios under stylized economic scenarios of the driver risk variables outside the value at risk models 
we use market risk information provided by the stress scenarios to adjust our economic capital requirements as needed 
we develop the stress scenarios using historical information and management judgment 
we stylize the stress scenarios regularly for our trading and non trading financial instruments 
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss due to inadequate or failed processes or systems 
we have begun the process of collecting loss data for the development of our economic capital requirement  which is not yet complete 
until we complete the development of our operational loss estimation models  we are basing our estimates of required capital on the basic indicator approach described in the international basel ii accord 
a significant proportion of our risk management strategies and risk evaluation rely on internally developed and externally procured models 
further  in certain areas of our risk management we use models to establish strategies aimed at eliminating much of the risk due to fluctuations in market factors 
thus we have significant exposure to the risk that our models may be inaccurate and therefore expose us to loss 
we manage model risk throughout countrywide using a variety of techniques including independent reviews of model documentation and appropriateness at the time of model development and introduction  ongoing model monitoring through back testing and validation  and benchmarking to peer models 
ongoing model performance results are reviewed at governance forums attended by model developers and users of the models 
at present  we assess model risk capital at the consolidated level 
insurance risk insurance risk arises from unexpectedly high payouts on insurance liabilities 
our insurance operations are exposed to a variety of risks including operational  market  counterparty and catastrophic risks 
these risks arise due to our underwriting activities  portfolio investments  re insurance transfers and exposure to catastrophic natural disasters 
the bulk of the capital allocated to the insurance business is to cover catastrophic risks  the largest component of which is hurricane risk 
our insurance operations partially manage the risks by reinsuring portions of the risks 
the reinsurance activities are considered while assessing allocated capital requirements 
credit capital scenario analysis we use scenario and stress analyses to assess portfolio vulnerabilities and to complement economic capital results 
for credit exposures  we maintain a credit risk profile that has been developed to help ensure that instantaneous erosions of housing equity  or a similar shock scenario  does not lead to increases in credit capital beyond established risk tolerances 
these equity erosion tests provide valuable information about a key source of risk exposure for the company 
our estimates of aggregate economic capital are lower than the current capital requirements of the rating agencies  which are generally our operative capital requirement at this time 
regulatory capital requirements we are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the board of governors of the federal reserve and the bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the office of comptroller of the currency 
the capital adequacy guidelines require us to maintain specific capital levels based on our assets and off balance sheet items 
our policy is to maintain our regulatory capital ratios at levels that are above the well capitalized standards defined by the federal reserve board 
at december  and  the company s and the bank s regulatory capital ratios and amounts and minimum required capital ratios for each entity to maintain a well capitalized status were as follows december  minimum countrywide financial corporation countrywide bank required ratio amount ratio amount dollar amounts in thousands tier leverage capital risk based capital tier total minimum required to qualify as well capitalized 
december  minimum countrywide financial corporation countrywide bank required ratio amount ratio amount dollar amounts in thousands tier leverage capital risk based capital tier total minimum required to qualify as well capitalized 
while the bank has not historically been a source of cash to countrywide financial corporation  banking regulations limit the bank s ability to transfer funds to the parent company 
as of december   billion of the bank s retained earnings were available for payment of dividends to the parent company without prior regulatory approval 
at december   the bank s retained earnings unavailable for dividends totaled million 
cash flow year ended december  compared to cash flow used by operating activities was billion for  compared to billion for cash flow used in operating activities includes the cash used for the origination and purchase of mortgage loans held for sale and the proceeds from the sales of such mortgages 
we generally retain servicing rights and may retain other interests when these loans are sold 
the transfer of the amounts retained is a non cash investing activity 
see note supplemental cash flow information in the financial statement section of this report

in  long term debt increased billion compared to an increase in long term debt of billion in off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees in the ordinary course of our business we engage in financial transactions that are not reflected on our balance sheet 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the financial statement section of this report for a description of our consolidation policy 
such transactions are structured to manage our interest rate  credit or liquidity risks  to diversify funding sources or to optimize our capital 
substantially all of our off balance sheet arrangements relate to the securitization of mortgage loans 
our mortgage loan securitizations are normally structured as sales as specified by sfas  and as such involve the transfer of the mortgage loans to qualifying special purpose entities that are not subject to consolidation 
in a securitization  an entity transferring the assets is able to convert those assets into cash 
special purpose entities used in such securitizations obtain cash to acquire the assets by issuing securities to investors 
in a securitization  we customarily provide representations and warranties with respect to the mortgage loans transferred 
in addition  we generally retain the right to service the transferred mortgage loans 
we also generally have the right to repurchase mortgage loans from the special purpose entity if the remaining outstanding balance of the mortgage loans falls to a level where the cost of servicing the loans becomes burdensome in relation to the benefits of servicing 
our prime mortgage loans generally are securitized on a non recourse basis  while prime home equity and nonprime loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for credit losses 
during  we securitized billion in nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans with limited recourse for credit losses 
our exposure to credit losses related to our limited recourse securitization activities is limited to the carrying value of our subordinated interests and to the contractual limit of reimbursable losses under our corporate guarantees less the recorded liability for such guarantees 
for a further discussion of our exposure to credit risk  see the section in this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk management 
we do not believe that any of our off balance sheet arrangements have had  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
the sales proceeds and cash flows from our securitizations for and additional information with respect to securitization activities are included in the financial statements section of this report note loan sales

in connection with our underwriting activities  at december  we had commitments to purchase and sell new issues of securities aggregating billion and billion  respectively 
prospective trends united states mortgage market over the last decade  total mortgage indebtedness in the united states has grown at an average annual rate of 
over the long term  we believe that continued population growth  ongoing developments in the mortgage market and the prospect of relatively low interest rates support growth in the market for the foreseeable future 
some of the ongoing developments in the mortgage market that we believe will contribute to its growth include government sponsored programs targeted to increase homeownership in low income and minority communities  the growth in nonprime lending  the growth of prime home equity lending as a major form of consumer finance and the increasing efficiency of the secondary mortgage market that lowers the overall cost of homeownership 
in the short term however  the us housing market is undergoing a significant contraction and both mortgage origination volumes and growth in total mortgage indebtedness is likely to decline 
over time  the level of complexity in the mortgage lending business has increased significantly due to several factors the continuing evolution of the secondary mortgage market and demand by borrowers has resulted in a proliferation of mortgage products greater regulation imposed on the industry has resulted in increased costs and the need for higher levels of specialization interest rate volatility has risen over the last decade 
at the same time  homeowners propensity to refinance their mortgages has increased as the refinance process has become more efficient and cost effective 
the combined result has been large swings in the volume of mortgage loans originated from year to year 
these volume swings have placed significant operational and financial pressures on mortgage lenders 
to compete effectively in this environment  mortgage lenders must have a very high level of operational  technological and managerial expertise 
in addition  the residential mortgage business has become more capital intensive and therefore access to capital at a competitive cost is critical 
primarily because of these factors  the industry has undergone consolidation in recent years 
today  large and sophisticated financial institutions dominate the residential mortgage industry 
these industry leaders are primarily commercial banks operating through their mortgage banking subsidiaries 
according to the trade publication inside mortgage finance  the top originators produced of all loans originated during  up from five years ago

the loan volume for the top five originators  according to inside mortgage finance  is as follows reprinted with the permission of imf copyrighted

years ended december  institution in billions countrywide wells fargo home mortgage washington mutual citimortgage chase home finance bank of america mortgage total for top five comparative data not included for the year in which the institution was not in the top five originators 
this consolidation trend has naturally carried over to the loan servicing side of the mortgage business 
today  the top mortgage servicers combined have a share of the total mortgages outstanding  up from five years ago 
following is a year over year comparison of loan volume for the top five servicers  according to inside mortgage finance reprinted with the permission of imf copyrighted 
all rights reserved by imf 
years ended december  institution in billions wells fargo home mortgage countrywide washington mutual chase home finance citimortgage total for top five we believe the consolidation trend will continue  as the aforementioned market forces will continue to drive out weak competitors 
we believe countrywide will benefit from consolidation through increased market share and enhanced ability to recruit talented personnel 
recently  well capitalized wall street investment banking firms have increased their participation in the mortgage banking business 
we expect the entrance of these firms to the marketplace to increase competition in the near term  especially in the nonconforming and nonprime loan products 
compared to countrywide  the other industry leaders are less reliant on the secondary mortgage market as an outlet for mortgages  due to their greater portfolio lending capacity 
this could place us at a competitive disadvantage in the future if the demand for adjustable rate mortgages continues  and either the secondary mortgage market does not continue to provide a competitive outlet for these loans  or we are unable to sustain an adequate portfolio lending capacity 
housing appreciation increasing housing values affect us in several ways 
rising housing values point to healthy demand for purchase money mortgage financing and increased average loan balances and a reduction in the risk of loss on sale of foreclosed real estate in the event a loan defaults 
however  as housing values appreciate  prepayments of existing mortgages tend to increase as mortgagors look to monetize the additional equity in their homes 
over the last several years  the housing price index has significantly outpaced the consumer price index and growth in personal income 
consequently  we expect housing values to increase at a slower rate in the coming years than in the past several years 
although it is likely that certain markets will experience housing price depreciation  we believe that price depreciation will not persist nationwide for an extended period of time 
over the long term  we expect that housing appreciation will be positively correlated with both consumer price inflation and growth in personal income 
secondary mortgage market investor demand changes in investor demand for nonprime mortgage loans can have a significant impact on our ability to access the secondary mortgage market as a competitive outlet 
in  we have seen an increase in investor required yields for nonprime loans together with a lessening in the liquidity of such loans 
this trend may negatively impact our willingness to sell such loans into the secondary mortgage market  the gain we may realize on any such sales and the pricing of such loans to consumers 
in addition  the market values of the credit subordinated securities that we currently hold may be negatively affected by this trend and accordingly  our consolidated earnings may be adversely affected 
impact of declines in credit performance with the current contraction in the us housing market and the resulting slowdown in price appreciation or price depreciation in some markets  along with worsening economic conditions  the credit losses we experience may increase in the future 
in  we have observed a decline in credit performance as adjusted for age in the nonprime loans we produced  especially those funded in deterioration in the credit performance of these loans could result in increased losses  future impairment of our related credit subordinated securities and higher claims under our representations and warranties 
regulatory trends the regulatory environments in which we operate have an impact on the activities in which we may engage  how the activities may be carried out and the profitability of those activities 
therefore  changes to laws  regulations or regulatory policies can affect whether and to what extent we are able to operate profitably 
for example  as discussed in the preceding part i  item i  regulations interagency guidance on residential mortgage products  on october   the federal financial regulatory agencies issued final interagency guidance on residential mortgage products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and or interest  including interest only mortgage loans and payment option adjustable rate mortgages  which provide a borrower with flexible payment options  including payments that have the potential for negative amortization 
the impact of this guidance on the industry and the company is uncertain at this time 
the aforementioned interagency guidance notwithstanding  proposed local  state and federal legislation targeted at predatory lending could have the unintended consequence of raising the cost or otherwise reducing the availability of mortgage credit for those potential borrowers with less than prime quality credit histories 
this could result in a reduction of otherwise legitimate nonprime lending opportunities 
in addition  there may be future local  state and federal legislation that restricts our ability to communicate with and solicit business from current and prospective customers in such a way that we are not able to originate new loans or sell other products at current profit margins 
mortgage originations following is our estimate of total united states mortgage originations market for each of the last five years calendar year united states mortgage originations in billions we estimate the mortgage origination market for to be trillion 
the forecasted reduction is attributable to an expected decline in both purchase and refinance activity 
we believe that the forecasted market would still be favorable for our loan production business  although we would expect increased competitive pressures to have some impact on its profitability 
this forecast would imply declining pressure on our loan servicing business due to a reduction in mortgage loan prepayment activity 
in our capital markets segment business  such a drop in mortgage originations would likely result in a reduction in mortgage securities trading and underwriting volume and our conduit activities  which would have a negative impact on profitability
