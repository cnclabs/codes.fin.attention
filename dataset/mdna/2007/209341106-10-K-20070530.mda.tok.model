our cost of sales mainly consists of raw materials consumed in the printing process  as well as labor and outside services  such as delivery costs 
paper cost is the most significant component of our materials cost  however  fluctuation in paper pricing generally does not materially impact our operating margins because we typically quote  and subsequently purchase  paper for each specific printing project we are awarded 
as a result  any changes in paper pricing are effectively passed through to customers by our printing businesses
