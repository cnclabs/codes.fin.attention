item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements 
you should review the risk factors section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward looking statements 
please refer to special note regarding forward looking statements for more information 
the results for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future periods 
general we operate primarily in two distinct business segments i ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal recycling scrap metal recycling  and ii lead fabricating 
the scrap metal recycling segment includes scrap metal recycling yards located in buffalo  rochester  syracuse  and niagara falls  new york  and an aluminum de ox plant and a scrap handling company each located in lackawanna  new york 
we are in the process of moving our aluminum de ox plant to larger facilities we own in syracuse  new york 
the lead fabrication and recycling segment includes five lead fabrication and recycling plants located in birmingham  alabama  healdsburg and ontario  california  carson city  nevada and granite city  illinois 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
contingencies we establish reserves for estimated liabilities  which primarily includes environmental remediation 
a loss contingency is accrued when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based upon currently available facts and presently enacted laws and regulations 
these estimated liabilities are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we regularly review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are impaired  the impairment is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future discounted cash flows 
assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized as goods are shipped  which generally is when title transfers and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to customers 
brokerage sales are recognized upon receipt of materials by the customer and reported net of costs in product sales 

table of contents accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers from product sales 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
our determination of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable includes a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  past experience with the accounts  changes in collection patterns and general industry conditions 
the loss of any significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
while we believe our allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate  changes in economic conditions or any weakness in the steel  metals  or construction industry could adversely impact our future earnings 
inventory our inventories consist primarily of ferrous and non ferrous scrap metal and lead metals and lead products 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
quantities of inventories are determined based on our inventory systems and are subject to periodic physical verification using techniques including observation  weighing and estimates 
prices of commodities we own are volatile 
we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for both ferrous and non ferrous metals  which are at times volatile 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to turn our inventories promptly and efficiently 
results of operations the company is divided into two industry segments scrap metal recycling  which breaks down into two general product categories  ferrous and non ferrous metals  and lead fabrication

table of contents the results of the scrap metal recycling segment operations depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the northeastern united states 
ferrous recyclers saw higher average selling prices and higher sales volumes during and into due primarily to higher domestic and foreign demand for scrap 
the increased demand can be attributed to the broad based recovery of the us and foreign economies 
we believe that near record prices for many grades of ferrous scrap in resulted in an overall increase of available scrap 
as the chart above illustrates  in and  we saw fluctuating prices for our ferrous scrap 
demand for our scrap remained relatively consistent throughout the year 
however  markets were affected by foreign buyers leaving the market for periods of time allowing domestic consumers to reduce their purchase prices 
prices for non ferrous metals reached record levels in and as the demand for metals continued to outpace supplies 
the global aluminum industry saw a tightening in supply in both years  thus pushing aluminum prices to year highs 
the scenario was similar in the case of other non ferrous metals on account of depleting stockpiles and sustained demand 
copper prices also rose to record highs in the lead fabrication segment is impacted by the price of lead 
the lead fabrication business can be positively affected by lower pricing of raw lead metals 
between december  and december   the spot price of lead on the london metal exchange increased 
in a business environment of increasing raw material costs like this  lead fabricators rely on their ability to pass on these increased lead raw material prices to maintain their profitability 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   compared to consolidated net sales of million in the year ended december  this increase in sales is due to higher sales volume of million and higher average selling prices of million 
scrap metal recycling ferrous sales ferrous sales increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   compared to ferrous sales of million in the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a increase in sales volumes  or an additional thousand tons representing sales of million and a increase in average selling prices accounting for million of the increase in sales of ferrous products

table of contents we are involved in certain other legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of such other proceedings and litigation will not materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company does not carry  and does not expect to carry for the foreseeable future  significant insurance coverage for environmental liability other than conditions existing at the syracuse facility prior to its acquisition by the company because the company believes that the cost for such insurance is not economical 
however  we continue to monitor products offered by various insurers that may prove to be practical 
accordingly  if the company were to incur liability for environmental damage in excess of accrued environmental remediation liabilities  its financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate borrowings 
as of december   variable rate borrowings mainly consisted of outstanding borrowings of million under our senior secured credit facility 
borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest at either the prime rate of interest plus a margin or libor plus a margin 
any increase in either the prime rate or libor will increase interest expense 
we do not have any interest rate swaps or caps in place which would mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate on this indebtedness 
assuming our variable borrowings were to equal the average borrowings under our senior secured credit facility during a fiscal year  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by would increase or decrease interest expense on our variable borrowings by approximately  per year  with a corresponding change in cash flows 
commodity price risk we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for both ferrous and non ferrous metals which are at times volatile 
see the discussion under the section entitled risk factors the metals recycling industry is highly cyclical and import and export markets can be volatile 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to turn our inventories quickly instead of holding inventories in speculation of higher commodity prices 
foreign currency risk international sales account for an immaterial amount of our consolidated net sales and all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we also purchase a small percentage of our raw materials from international vendors and these purchases are also denominated in local currencies 
consequently  we do not enter into any foreign currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the currency rates
