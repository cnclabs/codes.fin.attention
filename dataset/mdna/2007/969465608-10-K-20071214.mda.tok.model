for a discussion of factors affecting our business  see item business in this annual report on form k 
overview during fiscal  we saw our net sales decrease  or primarily due to new emission standards for the nafta market that went into effect january  our nafta sales during fiscal decreased approximately from the prior year 
offsetting the reduction in sales for nafta  we saw significant increases in sales in fiscal to the european and asian markets of each over fiscal levels 
for the year ended september   we sold approximately of our products in the united states  to canada and mexico for vehicles that are in part produced for the united states market and approximately to other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of our products were sold in the united states  were sold to canada and mexico for vehicles that are in part produced for the united states market and approximately to other international markets 
net income in fiscal was  compared to net income in fiscal of  as a result of increases in cash flows from operations  we paid down our outstanding debt by  in fiscal events during the year ended september  include the following on october  the company s common stock began trading on the nasdaq global market under the trading symbol wmco

we substantially completed our previously announced realignment of our portland  oregon manufacturing operations during fiscal this realignment continued our ongoing efforts to focus on our core product lines and improve our global competitiveness 
as part of this realignment  we have outsourced all of our die casting and machining operations to high quality suppliers  primarily in asia  and have relocated the assembly of pneumatic products to our manufacturing facility in suzhou  china 
as we move forward into fiscal and beyond  we will continue to work closely with our existing and potential customers to design and develop new products and adapt existing products to new applications  and to improve the performance  reliability and cost effectiveness of our products 
results of operations financial summary dollars in thousands to to net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    research and development    selling    administration    realignment of operations nm nm operating income    as a percentage of net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling administration realignment of operations operating income nm not meaningful comparative years ended september   and percent change to to for the year ended september net sales    net sales decreased  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   primarily due to an overall decrease of in sales volumes of electronic throttle control systems in the north american market 
overall  in the north american market  sales to truck customers were down approximately while increasing sales in the off road markets offset some of that decline 
decreases in north american sales volumes were partially offset by increases of in sales volumes in both the european and asian markets 
we expect that electronic throttle control sales will increase or decrease in the future in line with changes in heavy truck and transit bus production volumes in the various geographic markets in which we serve and when new product lines are established  however  competitive pricing may continue to reduce per unit pricing 
a change in emissions regulations in the united states effective january  had a negative impact on truck sales in north america during the second through fourth quarters of fiscal  and therefore on the sales of our products to heavy truck manufacturers in the united states  however  this does not represent a change in our overall penetration of this market 
the published reports of the decline in north american heavy truck production are that overall truck production volumes in north america in calendar year declined approximately over the calendar production volumes 
as this production shift has been attributed to the change in emission standards  it is anticipated that the north american truck production volumes will increase in subsequent years  although potentially not until and potentially not to the levels 
net sales increased  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   primarily due to increased sales volumes of electronic throttle control systems  specifically in the north american  asian and european markets  and to a lesser extent increase in sales of our pneumatic control systems 
net sales to our customers in asia increased approximately over fiscal  whereas net sales in north america and europe increased and  respectively 
percent change to to for the year ended september gross profit    gross profit was  or  of net sales for the year ended september   a decrease of  from the gross profit of  or  of net sales in the comparable fiscal period 
the decrease in gross profit in fiscal is primarily driven by a decrease in sales of electronic throttle and pneumatic control systems to north american heavy truck customers offset by an increase in sales to transit bus and off road customers in north america and higher sales volumes in other foreign markets 
during fiscal  we substantially completed our realignment of operations  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  and as a result of this realignment we have experienced an overall reduction in labor costs and material costs due to continued efforts in global sourcing and the production of our own internally developed contacting and non contacting sensors 
offsetting these realignment and sourcing savings  gross profit was negatively impacted by significantly higher purchase prices for certain raw materials  an increase in freight costs resulting from our global sourcing efforts  and an overall increase in overhead expenses primarily due to the costs associated with our manufacturing facility in suzhou  china 
gross profit was  or  of net sales for the year ended september   an increase of  from the gross profit of  or  of net sales in the comparable fiscal period 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal is primarily driven by a increase in sales of electronic throttle and pneumatic control systems to heavy truck  transit bus and off road customers 
gross profits also improved through lower component sourcing costs for some of our components as we shift suppliers to lower cost  high quality suppliers primarily in china  a reduction in our warranty liability of as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  and reductions in pension and post retirement benefit costs of approximately during the year gross profit was negatively impacted by significantly higher purchase prices for zinc and aluminum  higher overhead expenses due to costs associated with our manufacturing facility in suzhou  china  which opened during the second quarter of fiscal  and increased labor costs to support our higher sales volumes 
percent change to to for the year ended september research and development    research and development expenses decreased for the year ended september  compared to the same period in fiscal this decrease in research and development expense is primarily attributable to the timing of projects in development and the establishment of our internal conceptual design center  which has allowed us to reduce our needs for outside services for projects 
the company s research and development expenditures will fluctuate based on the programs and products under development at any given point in time 
research and development expenses increased for the year ended september  compared to the same period in fiscal this increase in research and development expense is primarily attributable to an increase in development efforts for new products  markets and sensors  resulting in slightly higher staffing levels and an overall increase in project expenses over the prior year 
percent change to to for the year ended september selling    selling expenses increased for the year ended september  as compared to the same period in fiscal the increase in selling expenses is the result of our continued efforts to expand our selling and marketing presence globally  specifically in europe and asia 
selling expenses increased for the year ended september  as compared to the same period in fiscal beginning in the second half of fiscal and throughout all of fiscal  we took several steps to expand our sales efforts  including the addition of sales personnel in the united states  china and europe and increased promotional materials 
additionally  we opened our europe and china sales offices in mid fiscal  and accordingly we did not incur significant costs associated with these offices in fiscal as compared to fiscal percent change to to for the year ended september administration    administration expenses for the year ended september  increased as compared to the same period in fiscal the increase in administration expenses is primarily a result of recording an additional of environmental liability at september  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
administration expenses also increased during fiscal as the company incurred costs to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we recorded total costs of approximately in fiscal related to the evaluation and audit of our internal controls 
legal fees  including those associated with the class action lawsuit  which is also discussed in note  decreased approximately 
during the years ended september  and  we recorded stock option compensation expense of and  respectively  in administration expense as a result of sfas no 
r as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
administration expenses for the year ended september  decreased as compared to the same period in fiscal included in administration expenses in the year ended september  were one time compensation and relocation costs incurred in fiscal with the commencement of employment of our president and chief executive officer and management fees  which were reduced as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  legal costs decreased from the prior year 
offsetting these reductions was an increase in information technology expenses to support our international operations and stock option compensation expense of percent change to to for the year ended september realignment of operations nm nm the company recorded expenses of for the year ended september  related to its realignment of operations as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded expenses of in fiscal year percent change to to for the year ended september interest income interest expense   interest expense on debt decreased for the year ended september  compared to the same period in fiscal due to significant reductions in debt levels 
during fiscal  we paid down  of long term debt and at september  our remaining outstanding long term debt balance is  we expect interest expense on debt to decrease significantly in the future as we anticipate paying down our outstanding debt in fiscal interest expense on debt decreased for the year ended september  compared to the same period in fiscal due to reductions in debt levels  partially offset by higher overall interest rates 
percent change to to for the year ended september other income  net  nm nm other income was  in fiscal and consisted primarily of a gain from the extinguishment of old outstanding accounts payable balances of various insolvent subsidiaries as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements and a gain from the extinguishment of old and disputed outstanding accounts payable balances related to an active subsidiary 
also included in other income in fiscal is a gain related to the sales and disposal of certain property  plant and equipment 
other income was in fiscal and consisted primarily of a gain from the extinguishment of old outstanding accounts payable balances of various insolvent subsidiaries as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements and a gain from the extinguishment of old and disputed outstanding accounts payable balances related to an active subsidiary 
other income of in fiscal consisted primarily of a gain from the extinguishment of old outstanding accounts payable balances of various insolvent subsidiaries as discussed in note  a gain from the extinguishment of old and disputed outstanding accounts payable balances related to an active subsidiary  and a loss associated with the disposal of certain property  plant and equipment 
percent change to to for the year ended september gain on put call option agreement nm nm as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the put call option agreement was terminated during the first quarter of fiscal and as a result of this termination a gain of was recognized 
the gain for the year ended september  relates to the change in the net value of the put call option agreement from september  to september  percent change to to for the year ended september income tax expense    in fiscal  the company recorded income tax expense of  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the overall tax rate was in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to an increase in our state tax rate and the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion at the end of calendar the fiscal tax rate included a reduction in deferred tax assets due to a change in state tax law  resulting in an overall increase in our tax rate in fiscal the company was in a net operating loss carry forward position during fiscal  and by the first quarter of fiscal the company had utilized all of its available federal net operating loss carry forwards 
federal net operating losses are subject to provisions of the internal revenue code  which potentially restrict the utilization of this type of tax attribute in the event of an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code section 
changes in ownership could significantly defer the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards 
the company does not believe that prior recapitalization transactions coupled with other changes in ownership  created a change in ownership as defined by the internal revenue code section financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations was  for the year ended september   an increase of from the cash generated from operations of  for the year ended september  cash flows from operations included net income of  and a non cash deferred tax provision of cash flows from operations for the year ended september  included net income of  and a non cash deferred tax provision of  related to utilization of our remaining net operating loss as well as certain credits 
changes in working capital items used cash of  for the year ended september  compared to  in the corresponding prior year period 
timing of collections on receivables and sales levels generated cash of in fiscal compared with an increase of  of receivables in the same period of fiscal cash was used to increase inventory levels during fiscal and the first half of fiscal to facilitate switching of suppliers to lower cost suppliers  primarily in china  our realignment efforts and to support increasing operations in our suzhou  china manufacturing facility 
we feel that inventory levels reached their maximum levels in mid fiscal and continue to decline as supplier switching and the realignment are fully completed 
for the year ended september  changes in inventory generated cash of compared to a use of cash of  for the year ended september  reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses in fiscal is primarily a result of decreases in inventory levels whereas in fiscal when inventory levels were significantly increased  accounts payable and accrued expenses also increased 
cash flows for the years ended september  and included payments to fund our pensions plans of  and  respectively 
we believe we will continue to generate positive cash flow from continuing operations 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended september  and included  of purchases of property  plant and equipment offset slightly by of proceeds from the sales of certain property  plant and equipment 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended september  and was comprised solely of purchases of property  plant and equipment 
we expect our cash use for investing activities to at least remain constant and potentially increase in the future as we continue to purchase capital equipment to expand and support our operations worldwide 
we currently anticipate spending approximately  in capital expenditures for the year ended september  cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended september   compared to cash used in financing activities of  for the year ended september  the use of cash for financing activities for fiscal primarily relates to the payment of  related to the fiscal excess cash flow requirement of our loan agreement with merrill lynch  scheduled quarterly debt payments on our merrill lynch term loan and an additional term loan payments of  additionally  we received cash proceeds of from the exercise of stock options 
the use of cash for financing activities for fiscal primarily relates to the repurchase of common stock from aip of  scheduled debt payments on our merrill lynch term loan and payment of  related to the fiscal excess cash flow requirement of our loan agreement with merrill lynch 
additionally  we received cash proceeds of from the exercise of stock options 
contractual obligations as of september  at september   our contractual obligations consisted of bank debt  operating lease obligations  a services agreement and a license agreement 
we do not have any material letters of credit  purchase commitments  or debt guarantees outstanding at september  maturities of these contractual obligations consist of the following payments due by period less than more than total year years years years term loan   revolver operating leases   mmt license minimum royalties management services agreement certain liabilities  including those related to our pension and post retirement benefit plans  are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets but are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of stated maturities 
we have net obligations at september  related to our pension plans and post retirement medical plan of  and  respectively 
we funded  to our pension plans in fiscal and we expect to make payments of  in fiscal to fund our pension plans 
at september   we had  available under our revolving credit facility plus cash and cash equivalents at september  of  we believe these resources  when combined with cash provided by operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs on a short term and long term basis as well as our capital expenditure needs 
included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is approximately of accounts payable related to closed insolvent subsidiaries of the company 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  a debtor can only relieve itself of a liability if it has been extinguished 
accordingly  a liability is considered extinguished if a the debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its obligation for the liability or b the debtor is legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability  either judicially or by the creditor 
during the years ended september   and  the company was judicially released from and reversed  and  respectively  of old accounts payable resulting in a gain  which has been recorded in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company expects to reverse amounts in future periods based on the recognition of the liabilities being judicially released in accordance with sfas no 
of in fiscal  and in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  cost of sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment  which is when title and risk of loss transfers to customers  and when all of the following have occurred a firm sales agreement is in place  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are reported net of estimated returns  rebates and customer discounts 
discounts and rebates are recorded during the period they are earned by the customer 
warranty we provide a warranty covering defects arising from products sold 
the product warranty liability is based on historical return rates of products and amounts for significant and specific warranty issues 
the warranty is limited to a specified time period  mileage or hours of use  and varies by product  application and customer 
the company has recorded a warranty liability  which in the opinion of management is adequate to cover such costs 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  they are subject to change and such change could be material 
legal we are involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceedings from time to time 
such litigation involves uncertainty as to possible losses we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
in connection with such claims and lawsuits  we estimate the probability of losses based on advice of legal counsel  the outcomes of similar litigation  legislative development and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
we expense legal expenses related to claims in the period incurred 
a significant change in our estimates  or a result that materially differs from our estimates  could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
environmental we estimate the costs of investigation and remediation for certain soil and groundwater contaminants at our portland  oregon facility 
the ultimate costs to the company for the investigation  remediation and monitoring of this site cannot be predicted with certainty due to the often unknown magnitude of the pollution or the necessary cleanup  the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods  the amount of time necessary to accomplish such cleanups and the evolving nature of cleanup technologies and governmental regulations 
the company has recognized a liability for environmental remediation costs for this site in an amount that management believes is probable and reasonably estimable 
when the estimate of a probable loss is within a range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued when no estimate within the range is better than another 
in making these judgments and assumptions  the company considers  among other things  the activity to date at the site and information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors 
the company regularly monitors its exposure to environmental loss contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  it is at least reasonably possible that a change in the estimated liability accrual will occur in the near future 
pensions and post retirement benefit obligations pension and post retirement benefit obligations and net period benefit cost are calculated using actuarial models 
the most important assumptions that affect these computations are the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rates 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
these assumptions are evaluated at least annually and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
our discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments 
to determine our discount rate  we discounted the expected benefit payments using the citigroup pension discount liability index yield curve 
the equivalent level interest rate that produces the same present value of benefits was then determined 
our assumed rate does not differ significantly from this benchmark rate 
we assumed a discount rate of to determine our pension benefit obligations at september  and a rate of to determine our net periodic benefit cost in fiscal a decrease in these discount rates would have increased our pension benefit obligations at the end of fiscal by  and increased our net periodic benefit cost in by a increase in discount rates would have decreased our pension obligations at september  by  and decreased our net periodic benefit cost in by to determine the discount rate for our post retirement benefit plan  we also discounted the expected benefit payments using the citigroup pension discount liability index yield curve 
a decrease in discount rate for our post retirement benefit plan would have increased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and increased our post retirement benefit expense in by a increase in discount rate would have decreased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and decreased our post retirement benefit expense in by to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current asset allocations and the historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets obtained from our investment portfolio manager 
information regarding our asset allocations is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have impacted net periodic benefit cost in fiscal by our post retirement plan does not contain any plan assets 
we assumed healthcare cost trend rates for our post retirement plan of in  decreasing gradually to in and remaining at thereafter 
a increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have increased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and increased post retirement benefit expense in by a decrease in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have decreased the post retirement benefit obligation by at the end of fiscal and decreased post retirement benefit expense in by stock based compensation expense as of october   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires us to measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards  and awards we grant  modify  repurchase or cancel in the future  at fair value and recognize compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when calculating fair value including estimated stock price volatility  expected term and expected forfeitures 
factors considered in estimating forfeitures include the types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
we recorded of stock based compensation expense for the year ended september  stock based compensation expense recorded during the year ended september  in our consolidated statement of operations included in cost of sales  in research and development  in selling and the remaining in administration expense 
we recorded of stock based compensation expense for the year ended september  stock based compensation expense recorded during the year ended september  in our consolidated statement of operations included in cost of sales  in research and development  in selling and the remaining in administration expense 
income taxes for each jurisdiction that we operate in  we are required to estimate our annual effective tax rate together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and unless we believe that recovery is more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
our income tax provision on the consolidated statement of operations is impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
this process is complex and involves significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 quantifying financial misstatements  which expresses the staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
registrants are required to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on the current year financial statements 
the financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material  after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
sab no

in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which clarifies the accounting uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  the company will adopt fin in the first quarter of fiscal the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of investments 
the company s primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate risk the company has a five year revolving and term loan agreement with its primary lender merrill lynch 
interest rates under the agreement are variable and are based on the election of the company of either a libor rate or prime rate 
as of september   the outstanding balance on the term loan was  and there was no balance outstanding on the revolving loan 
the average effective annual interest rate on the term loan was as of september  the company does not believe that a hypothetical change in end of the period interest rates or changes in future interest rates on these variable rate obligations would have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company has not hedged its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
foreign currency risk we sell our products to customers in the heavy truck  transit bus and off road equipment industries 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  the company had foreign sales of approximately and of net sales  respectively 
all worldwide sales in fiscal and  with the exception of and  respectively  were denominated in us dollars 
during fiscal  we established a manufacturing facility in suzhou  china and we opened sales offices in shanghai  china and ismaning munich  germany 
we purchase components internationally for use in both our products whose sales are denominated in us dollars and other currencies 
although the company is expanding its international exposure  it does not believe that changes in future exchange rates would have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows at this time 
as a result  the company has not entered into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions to hedge against foreign currency risk 
the company will continue to assess its foreign currency risk as its international operations  international purchases and sales increase 
investment risk the company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments 
the company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable and long term obligations 
the company s cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable balances are short term in nature  and  thus  the company believes they are not exposed to material investment risk
