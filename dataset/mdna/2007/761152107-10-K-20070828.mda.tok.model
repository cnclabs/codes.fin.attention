we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering a customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first in  first out method 
we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the likelihood of any material inventory write downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or rapid changes in customer demand 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends  significant changes in our strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  and a significant change in the economic and or political conditions in certain countries 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in  and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
provision for warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model  which takes into consideration actual  historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products 
this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related 
table of contents to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision 
although we engage in product improvement programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 
revenue recognition 
revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment  at which time title transfers to the customer 
revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received 
royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned 
service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract 
revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract 
revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract 
freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue 
all freight related expenses are charged to cost of sales 
we do not recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities 
however  as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders  one time special pricing to support new product introductions  sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price breaks for regular order volumes 
the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue 
in our domestic sales activities we use a number of manufacturer representatives to sell our products 
these representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force 
we do not sell our products to these representatives  and do not recognize revenue on such shipments 
our products are predominantly therapy based equipment and require no installation 
as such  we have no significant installation obligations 
stock based compensation 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we measure the compensation of all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant 
such value is recognized as compensation expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including the type of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
voluntary product recall expenses 
we recognized an accrual for the estimated cost of the voluntary product recall at the time the liability was probable and the related expenses could be reasonably estimated 
the amount of this accrual was determined taking into consideration the future probable expenses directly related to the product recall including expected return rates for the affected units  unit replacement costs  legal  consulting  logistical and administrative expenses 
should actual product recall costs differ from our estimated costs or should we receive additional feedback from our ongoing discussions with regulatory bodies  revisions to our estimated product recall accrual may be required
