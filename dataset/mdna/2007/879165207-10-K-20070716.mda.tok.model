item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal year  revenues declined  and the company sustained a net loss  primarily due to the lower revenues 
sales in the prior fiscal year were higher due to the shipment of the t m and the t n with the us army and shipment of the t n to royal australian air force  through our distributor  as well as the final shipments of the an apm to the us navy and sales of the t the delay in government contract awards contributed to this decline in revenues as well as the continued financial difficulties in the commercial airline industry and the increased competition 
over the last two years the company won competitive awards from the us navy for two multi year contracts for the an upm craft and the an arm itats 
these contracts include multi year deliveries  commencing late in calendar year  and have an aggregate value of approximately million 
the products under these contracts represent cutting edge technology  and should provide tel with a competitive advantage for years to come see item description of business 
the company s backlog at march  has significantly increased to approximately million  including million attributed to the an arm itats contract 
the gross profit on the million initial portion of the itats contract will be significantly less than tel s historical gross profit due to the use of an engineering subcontractor  and the competitiveness of the bidding process 
design validation for the an usm is not expected to begin until late in  with shipments to begin late in calendar year commercial backlog also increased as a result of orders from the company s distributors 
a substantial part of the company s business comes from orders that are filled in less than a year  and therefore  are not reflected in the backlog 
the company has recently hired a new director of business development to pursue these opportunities as well as long term government contracts 
research and development expenditures will continue to remain high in order to support the two new large contract awards previously discussed 
the company has been able to partially offset the research and development expenditures by implementing a profit improvement plan  which resulted in substantial reductions in operating expenses 
as a consequence of this temporary significant decline in revenues exceeding operating costs  operating profits  working capital  stockholders equity  and cash have declined for the current fiscal year 
however  the company believes that it has adequate liquidity  resources and backlog to fund operating plans during this interval  and until deliveries of its new units commence
