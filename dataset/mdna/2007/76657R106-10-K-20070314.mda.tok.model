overview we are a leading provider of customer experience management software solutions for companies of all sizes 
our on demand software is designed to go beyond traditional customer relationship management crm solutions to help companies improve their customer experiences  while reducing operating costs 
our software solutions support a business s external customer facing channels as well as sales  marketing and customer service operations 
we released our initial version of rightnow service in this product addressed the new customer service needs resulting from the increasing use of the internet as a customer service channel 
since then  we have significantly enhanced product features and functionality to address customer service needs across multiple communication channels  including web  interactive voice  email  chat  telephone and proactive outbound email communications 
we have also added several products that are complementary to our rightnow service solution  including rightnow marketing  rightnow sales  and rightnow feedback which automate aspects of marketing campaigns sales operations  and customer monitoring 
in may  we purchased the assets of convergent voice  and added voice enabled crm capabilities to our product portfolio 
in may  we purchased salesnet  inc  a provider of salesforce automation solutions 
to date  approximately to of our revenue has been generated by the rightnow service suite 
during  we signed new customers and added approximately customers through our acquisition of salesnet  inc  to bring our customer base to approximately  our products served more than billion customer interactions  or unique sessions hosted by our solutions 
our software solutions are available either on a hosted basis  where they are deployed in our co location facilities and accessed on demand by our clients  or on a non hosted basis  where our clients deploy them in their own facilities 
approximately of our clients have elected the hosted option as of december  we distribute our solutions primarily through direct sales efforts and to a lesser extent through indirect channels 
business model changes to better align with industry practice  we have changed the nature of the majority of our product offerings beginning in from software license arrangements to service arrangements eg a subscription or hosting services 
as the industry and business models for software as a service or on demand have evolved  the standard form of arrangements are service agreements rather than licenses of software that can be hosted 
we believe providing offerings in this manner will ultimately increase our market penetration 
accordingly  our terms of sale have been revised to provide a hosting service where the customer accesses the software and data via the internet 
our previous terms of sale provided the customer a software license  and customer choice to have the software hosted by us  by themselves or by someone else 
we believe that revenue recognition for service arrangements will not be materially different from our previous term license arrangements  as revenue under either type of contract is generally recognized ratably over the period of the agreement 
we also believe that additions to deferred revenue will be less than recent history because  under service agreements  only the amount currently due from the customer is recorded to accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
under license agreements  we record the full customer commitment to receivables and deferred revenue whether or not currently due because we have the contractual right to collect the entire arrangement fee 
in addition  in we have begun to essentially discontinue selling perpetual software licenses  which represented of our revenue for although we expect to ultimately increase the lifetime value of our customer arrangements through subscriptions  the substantial elimination of perpetual license sales will materially and adversely impact our operating results for when compared to as perpetual revenue has generally been recognized in full upon delivery of the license 
lastly  our policy for subscription contract acquisition costs  such as sales commissions  is to recognize them in proportion to the revenue recognized under the subscription arrangement 
since we expect the majority of new business to be subscriptions in  we believe this policy will have a material and beneficial impact on our and operating results 
commissions paid on sales of licenses in will continue to be expensed when earned 
sources of revenue our revenue is comprised of fees for software  hosting and support  and fees for professional services 
software  hosting and support revenue includes fees earned under software license agreements and subscription services agreements 
license agreements typically include a software license  hosting services  and support services 
our hosting services provide remote management and maintenance of our software and customers data which is physically located in third party facilities 
customers access hosted software and data via secure internet connection 
support services include technical assistance for our software products and unspecified product upgrades on a when and if available basis 
license agreements can be over time a term license or perpetual 
for term licenses  software  hosting and support revenue is recognized ratably over the length of the agreement 
the majority of our revenue over the past three years has been from the sale of two year term licenses 
perpetual license revenue is recorded in full upon delivery of the license  and the hosting and support elements are recognized ratably over the contractual period 
perpetual license revenue has ranged from to of our revenue during the past three years 
subscription agreements  which we began to sell in when we acquired salesnet  inc  include a bundled fee to access the software and data via our hosting services  and support services 
subscription revenue is recorded ratably over the length of the agreement 
we refer to recurring revenue in this report  which includes software  hosting and support revenue from term license and subscription agreements  and post contract support services 
our sales agreements generally include capacity based fees  which are measured primarily by web pages served  user seats  outgoing email transactions  or minutes used  and certain fixed fees 
a number of our agreements provide for additional fees for usage above established levels  which are billed and recognized into revenue when earned 
professional services revenue is comprised of revenue from consulting  education and development services  and reimbursement of related travel costs 
consulting and education services include implementation and best practices consulting 
development services include customizations and integrations for a client s specific business application 
professional services revenue ranged from to of total revenue in the past three years 
professional services are sold with initial license agreements and periodically over the client engagement 
the average deployment time for our clients is approximately days 
our typical education courses are billed on a per person  per class basis 
depending on the size and complexity of the client project  our consulting or development services contracts are either fixed price fixed scope or  less frequently  billed on a time and materials basis 
we have determined that the professional services element of our software arrangements is not essential to the functionality of the software 
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and related expenses such as employee benefits and payroll taxes for our hosting  support and professional services organizations  third party costs and equipment depreciation relating to our hosting services  third party costs for voice enabled crm applications  travel expenses related to providing professional services to our clients  amortization of acquired intangible assets and allocated overhead 
we allocate most overhead expenses  such as office supplies  computer supplies  utilities  rent  depreciation for furniture and equipment  payroll taxes and employee benefits  based on headcount 
as a result  overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
beginning january   cost of revenue also includes stock based compensation expense 
our hosting costs are affected by the percentage of clients who license our products on a hosted basis and the number of times our clients and their customers use our solutions  which we refer to as customer interactions 
as a result of economies of scale in our hosting infrastructure and declines in computer hardware and telecommunications costs  we were able to reduce hosting costs as a percentage of total revenue in  and hosting costs increased slightly in  mostly due to the addition of a european hosting center which was in service in the quarter ended september  as our client base and solutions usage grows  we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our hosting services  technical support and professional services 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for employees in sales and marketing  including commissions and bonuses  advertising  marketing events  corporate communications  product management expenses  travel costs and allocated overhead 
beginning january   sales and marketing expenses also include stock based compensation expense 
we expense our sales commissions on license arrangements when earned  which is typically at the time the related sale is invoiced to the client 
for subscription arrangements  we expense the related sales commission in proportion to the revenue recognized 
since the majority of our historical revenue has been from license arrangements recognized over time  we have experienced a delay between increasing sales and marketing expenses and the recognition of corresponding revenue 
we expect significant additional increases in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars as we continue to hire additional sales and marketing personnel and increase the level of marketing activities 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses for development personnel and costs related to the development of new products  enhancement of existing products  translation fees  quality assurance  testing and allocated overhead 
beginning january   research and development expenses also include stock based compensation expense 
to date  we have not capitalized any software development costs because the timing of the commercial releases of our products has substantially coincided with the attainment of technological feasibility 
as a result  research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
we intend to continue to expand and enhance our product offerings 
to accomplish this  we plan to hire additional personnel and  from time to time  contract with third parties 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we seek to expand our technology and product offerings 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses for management  finance and accounting  legal  information systems and human resources personnel  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
beginning january   general and administrative expenses also include stock based compensation expense 
we anticipate that we will incur additional employee salaries and related expenses  professional service fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  valuation of receivables and deferred tax assets  and accounting for share based compensation 
revenue recognition we account for the majority of our sales arrangements in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
the application of these rules requires judgment  including the identification of individual elements in multiple element arrangements  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  including vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  for some or all elements 
customers may receive certain elements upon delivery or over time 
for example  our term license arrangements are bundled to include a software license which is delivered immediately  and hosting and support services  which are delivered continuously over the length of the agreement 
fair value for each element does not exist since none are sold separately  and consequently  the revenue is recognized ratably over the length of the agreement 
under a perpetual license arrangement  vsoe of the hosting and support elements is based on the price charged at renewal when sold separately  and therefore the license element is recognized immediately into revenue upon delivery using the residual method  and the hosting and support elements are recognized ratably over the contractual term 
we acquired salesnet  inc in may and we account for its sales arrangements under emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
under these arrangements  fees charged for access to the software  hosting services  and support services are recognized ratably over the length of the agreement  and fees charged for professional services are recognized when delivered 
we believe the fees for professional services qualify for separate accounting because a the services have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  b objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for these services  and c performance of the services is considered probable and does not involve unique customer acceptance criteria 
beginning in  we changed the nature of our product offerings from license arrangements to subscription service arrangements 
subscription arrangements do not provide the customer a contractual right to take possession of the software without significant penalty 
we expect to account for sales of subscription service arrangements under eitf as described above 
changes to the elements in our sales arrangements  or our ability to establish vsoe or fair value for those elements  may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 
our standard payment terms are net  although payment within days is considered normal 
we provide extended payment terms in certain circumstances 
in such cases  judgment is required in determining whether our fee is fixed or determinable and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
changes to our practice of providing extended payment terms or providing concessions following a sale  may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly assess the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices and  in so doing  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current creditworthiness  customer concentration  age of the receivable balance  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates and exceed our related loss allowance 
income taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
when applicable  a valuation allowance is established to reduce any deferred tax asset when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have established a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding the realization of our net operating loss carryforwards  tax credits  and deductible timing differences 
the uncertainty of realizing these benefits is based primarily on our lack of taxable earnings 
share based compensation we have adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  sfas r beginning january  utilizing the modified prospective method 
this statement requires the cost of share based payment arrangements to be recorded in the statement of operations 
prior to  the estimated cost of share based payment arrangements was disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements 
share based compensation amounts are affected by our stock price as well as our assumptions regarding the expected volatility of our stock  our employee stock option exercise behaviors  and the related income tax effects 
our assumptions are based primarily on our historical information  some of which was developed when we were a private company 
recently issued accounting standards in march  the emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
 how taxes collected and remitted to government authorities should be presented in income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the issue addresses how nondiscretionary amounts assessed by government authorities in connection with a transaction with a customer  such as sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes  should be presented in the financial statements 
the conclusion is that the presentation of taxes within the scope of this issue on either a gross included in revenues and costs or net excluded from revenues basis is an accounting policy decision 
the company s policy is to present revenue on a net basis 
sfas  fair value measurements  defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies when other accounting pronouncements require fair value measurements  it does not require new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standard board issued fasb interpretation  accounting for income tax uncertainties fin 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
the recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
we believe there will be no material impact to our consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption of fin results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated  expressed as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  revenue software  hosting and support professional services total revenue cost of revenue software  hosting and support professional services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss the following table sets forth our on demand customer interactions and our revenue by type and geography expressed as a percentage of total revenue for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  customer interactions in millions revenue by type recurring term licenses  hosting and support perpetual licenses professional services revenue by geography in united states europe asia pacific overview of total revenue for increased over  consisting of similar percentage gains in both software  hosting and support revenue and professional services revenue 
within software  hosting and support  recurring revenue increased during while perpetual license revenue increased only 
recurring revenue increased in due to growth in the number of customers and higher average revenue per customer 
we believe perpetual license revenue grew at a much slower pace due to an accelerated market adoption of on demand  or software as a service  where customers would rather rent the software and hosting service over time as opposed to owning a software license outright 
we added customers to our base in  of which approximately were included as part of our acquisition of salesnet  inc in may  total active customers at december  were approximately  revenue per customer improved from the release of new products and customer purchases of additional capacity 
sales to customers greater than billion in annual revenues and the public sector made up approximately of total revenue in  up from approximately of total revenue in and in during we continued to invest in our operations by adding capacity and a new european data center for our hosting operations  sales and marketing personnel to focus on new customer acquisition  professional services personnel to support our solution offerings  and software developers to broaden and enhance our solution offerings 
these investments  and the addition of million of stock based compensation expense in  caused total expenses to increase during the increase in operating expenses combined with a lower proportion of perpetual license revenue resulted in an operating loss of of revenue in for the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations compared to million of cash in  and increased our deferred revenue to million at december  from million one year earlier  mostly due to increases in the number and average size of sales transactions in as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
this deficit and our historical operating losses were primarily the result of costs incurred in the development  sales and marketing of our products and for general and administrative purposes

total active customers increased to approximately  at december  as compared to approximately  at the end of  due in part to our acquisition of salesnet  inc in may   and from our focus on new customer acquisition in our sales and marketing organizations

new product sales increased in over and included rightnow voice  rightnow sales  and rightnow marketing 
customer interactions  a measure of unique customer sessions hosted in our data centers  exceeded billion in  a increase over our client retention rate was approximately in and beginning january   software  hosting and support revenue includes the value of certain tools that had been categorized as professional services revenue in prior periods 
this change in revenue classification follows the transfer of ongoing development and support responsibility for these tools from the professional services organization to the product development organization effective january  perpetual license revenue increased  or  in over  and decreased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in the mix of perpetual license revenue affects our profitability in any given period since it is recorded in full into revenue upon delivery instead of being recorded ratably into revenue over time  as is the case with term licenses 
over the past eight quarters  perpetual license revenue has ranged from to of total revenue  but has consistently decreased as a percent of our overall new business 
we believe this decrease results from accelerating customer adoption of on demand software 
beginning in  we changed the nature of our sales arrangements from software licenses to subscriptions  which is expected to largely eliminate new sales of perpetual licenses 
consequently  we expect a substantial decline in perpetual revenue in when compared to professional services revenue increased million  or  in over  due to growth in the average number of customers and growth in average professional services revenue per customer 
average revenue per customer increased during and primarily due to our focus on expanding services offered in conjunction with our broader product offerings 
we also increased our capacity to deliver professional services by growing headcount in that organization to at december  from at december  the mix of professional services revenue affects our profitability from period to period due to the lower gross profit earned on professional services as compared to the gross profit earned on software  hosting and support revenue 
professional services revenue represented of total revenue in and as compared to of revenue in we expect professional services revenue to range between and of total revenue in the future 
total revenue for was million  an increase of million  or  over total revenue of million for software  hosting and support revenue for was million  an increase of million or over software  hosting and support revenue of million for recurring software  hosting and support revenue grew in to million from million in  primarily due to a increase in average revenue per client  combined with an increase in average number of clients 
average revenue per client increased from the release of new products  capacity upgrades  and contract renewals 
new products introduced in recent years represented approximately of total sales in  and included sales of rightnow marketing  rightnow sales  and rightnow voice 
growth in average number of clients occurred because of an emphasis within our sales organization on new client acquisition  combined with our annualized client retention rate 
perpetual software license revenue increased in to million  up from million in we believe perpetual license revenue increased in because of the growing strategic importance of our products in client organizations  our growing proportion of business with large enterprises  and longer client planning horizons 
professional services revenue increased to million in from million in average professional services revenue per client increased during  while average number of clients increased

as noted above under business model changes  we changed the nature of our sales arrangements from licenses to subscriptions beginning in under license arrangements  we expense sales incentives when earned  which is typically upon contract signing 
under subscription arrangements  we defer the related sales incentive costs and expense them in proportion to the revenue recognized 
since we expect the majority of our new sales in to be subscriptions  this accounting treatment  on its own  would be expected to decrease sales and marketing expenses as a percent of total revenue in as compared to however  because of the move to largely eliminate perpetual revenue in and expected additional investment in sales and marketing personnel and programs in  we expect full year sales and marketing expenses to remain approximately constant as a percent of revenue when compared to sales and marketing expenses of million in were  or million  greater than expenses of million in the average employee count in our sales and marketing organizations grew to in from in  causing salaries and related expenses to increase million

average employee count in our general and administrative organization in was compared to in  which caused salaries and related expenses to increase  during audit and related compliance costs increased  in  mostly due to being the initial year of our required internal controls reporting under the sarbanes oxley act of stock based compensation expense we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment  beginning january  using the modified prospective method 
financial statements for prior years have not been restated to conform to the presentation 
total stock based compensation expense for was million  which has been recorded to each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
we estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees and non employee directors using the black scholes merton option pricing model  which involves complex assumptions regarding our stock price volatility and the expected stock option exercise behavior of our employees 
for  we expect total stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
the actual expense could differ materially from this estimate due to differences between actual experience and our assumptions as to the number of option awards granted or forfeited  changes in our stock price volatility and expected term of option awards  and changes in our stock price 
interest and other income expense  net year ended december  percent change percent change amounts in thousands interest income interest expense n m n m other income expense n m n m total interest and other income expense  net n m interest income increased in over due to growth in the average yield to maturity in our investment portfolio  as well as growth in our cash and short term investment balances 
investment yields have risen along with the periodic increases in the federal funds rate 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of short term  investment grade government and corporate debt instruments 
interest income increased in as compared to due to a full year of interest earnings on our cash and short term investments for we invested the majority of the million proceeds from our initial public offering in august interest expense for and  comprised of the interest component under various capital lease obligations  was substantially less than due to the pay off of our then outstanding debt in the third quarter of other income expense consists primarily of gains or losses on asset sales and foreign currency transaction gains or losses  which individually and in aggregate have been insignificant for the past three years 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of  in   in  and  in  consists primarily of the federal alternative minimum tax  foreign withholding taxes  and various state income taxes 
our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credits  federal alternative minimum taxes  foreign rate differentials  and non deductible meal and entertainment expenses 
our effective tax rate in will depend on a number of factors  such as the amount and mix of stock based compensation expense to be recorded under sfas r  the level of business in state and foreign tax jurisdictions  management s expectation of the realization of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance  and other factors 
at december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets that have been reserved in full by a valuation allowance 
in the future  if available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets are realizable  an adjustment to decrease the valuation allowance would increase income or reduce goodwill  in the period such determination was made 
if and when that happens  our effective income tax rate will increase to more closely approximate the federal statutory rate 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters through december  this information is unaudited but  in management s opinion  has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that our management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented 
this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

professional services revenue has ranged from to of total revenue  and generally increased in dollar terms due to the expansion of our service offerings 
quarter to quarter variations in professional services revenue occurs because of customer scheduling requirements  and training and education of newly hired personnel 
cost of revenue for software  hosting and support  and professional services  as a percent of total revenue  trended higher in due to investments in hosting capacity  the addition of stock based compensation expense  and lower perpetual license revenue 
the mix of term and perpetual software licenses sold in each quarter impacts our quarterly results of operations 
for example  in the quarters ended march  and december   perpetual licenses represented a lower proportion of total revenue than in other periods  and consequently  income from operations was also lower in those periods 
over the past eight quarters  perpetual license revenue has trended lower as a percent of our overall new business  which we believe is caused by accelerating customer adoption of on demand software 
beginning in  we have essentially eliminated perpetual revenue from our business model and expect a substantial reduction in perpetual revenue when compared to sales and marketing expenses have increased in absolute dollar costs  and increased as a percent of revenue in  mostly due to revenue growth  higher advertising and promotional expenses  the inclusion of stock based compensation expense  and lower perpetual revenue 
for the quarters ended september   and december   sales and marketing expenses were lower as a percentage of revenue due to the timing of employee additions and marketing campaigns  and relatively lower commissions expense 
consequently  operating income in those quarters was unusually high 
we expect to substantially reduce perpetual revenue from our results for  and to defer commissions expense pertaining to subscription agreements and recognize them in proportion to the revenue recognized beginning in as a percent of revenue  we expect sales and marketing expenses to stay approximately constant for the full year as compared to the amount and timing of our operating results generally will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our level of actual and anticipated business activities 
factors affecting quarterly operating results can include  but are not limited to our ability to retain and increase sales to existing clients  attract new clients and satisfy our clients requirements  changes in the volume and mix of term and perpetual licenses sold in a particular quarter  because perpetual license revenue is recorded into revenue upon delivery whereas term licenses are recorded into revenue ratably over the period of the license  our policy of expensing sales commissions pertaining to license arrangements when earned  which is typically at the time of invoice  while the majority of our revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over future periods  changes in the mix of revenue between professional services and software  hosting and support  because the gross margin on professional services is typically lower than the gross margin on software  hosting and support  changes in the mix of voice self service applications sold and or usage volume  because the gross margin on voice self service applications is typically lower than the gross margin on our sales  marketing and service applications  the timing and success of new product introductions or upgrades by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  our ability to expand our operations  and the amount and timing of expenditures related to this expansion  the cost and availability of hosting services at co location facilities  our ability to realize efficiencies from our hosting and technical support operations  changes in the payment terms for our products and services  the purchasing and budgeting cycles of our clients  the rate of success of our domestic and international expansion  our ability to retain  recruit and hire key executives and technical and sales and marketing personnel  costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies  products or businesses  changes in our assumptions of stock price volatility or employee exercise behaviors  or changes in the number of stock options granted and vesting requirements in any particular period  which effects the amount of stock based compensation expense  seasonality in certain of our clients purchasing habits  and general economic  industry and market conditions 
our revenue and operating results have been difficult to forecast and may fluctuate  and we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful 
as a result  you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future performance 
we have experienced seasonality in certain aspects of our business  including lower perpetual license sales in the us in the quarter ending march  and increased purchasing when our clients fiscal years are ending 
our us federal government clients fiscal years end in september and most of our japanese clients fiscal years end in march 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  percent change percent change amounts in thousands deferred revenue cash provided by operating activities we have historically funded our operations with cash from operations  equity financings and debt borrowings 
in august we completed our initial public offering of approximately million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
the majority of the offering proceeds are invested in short term  investment grade  government and corporate debt securities 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments  totaled million 
in addition to our cash and short term investments  other sources of liquidity at december  included a million bank line of credit facility  under which there were no borrowings in or operating activities provided million of cash during the year ended december  as compared to million in and million in the majority of our cash from operations in all three years was from net income loss adjusted for non cash charges and growth in deferred revenue  partially offset by growth in receivables 
we typically bill customers on net day terms at the beginning of the contract period  which is reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
in periods of increasing sales  we would expect growth in accounts receivable and deferred revenue which  historically  has provided funding for operations 
a change in the billing practice resulting in delayed payment terms could have a material adverse effect on cash provided from operating activities and growth in deferred revenue 
we expect no impact to cash flow from operations as a result of our policy to defer sales commissions under subscription arrangements 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable represented approximately of current accounts and term receivables at december  and  respectively 
accounts written off in were relatively constant as a percentage of new billings from the previous year 
we regularly assess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual write offs could exceed our estimates and adversely affect operating cash flows in the future 
we have approximately million of payments due in under contractual obligations and purchase commitments for operating and capital leases  hosting services and other items 
total purchase commitments at december  were million to be paid per the schedule below 
we believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations to satisfy these commitments in investing activities consumed million in  which included million net purchases of short term investments  million to acquire salesnet  inc  and million for capital expenditures 
capital asset additions during the past three years consisted of equipment acquisitions for our hosting operations and employee growth  and are expected to range between million and million for business acquisitions in consumed million for the assets of convergent voice 
investing activities provided million during  mostly due to the liquidation of short term investments 
financing activities provided million in  million in and million in in we received million of proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock 
other financing sources included the exercise of employee stock options under our equity incentive plan and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we had borrowed million under long term debt agreements during the first six months of  and subsequently paid down all outstanding long term debt during the third quarter of in  we borrowed  related to tenant improvements at our headquarters office facility 
we believe our existing cash and short term investments  together with funds generated from operations  should be sufficient to fund operating and investment requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth and expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the possible acquisition of complementary products or businesses  the timing and extent of spending required for research and development efforts  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
additional equity or debt financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k promulgated by the sec

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuation due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound  australian dollar and japanese yen  because our contracts are frequently denominated in local currency 
in the future  we may utilize foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures 
we do not currently have any such contracts in place  nor did we enter into any such contracts during the years ended december  or december  interest rate sensitivity net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock are invested in short term  interest bearing securities  which are subject to credit and interest rate risk 
our portfolio is investment grade and diversified among issuers and security types to reduce credit risk 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a large portion of our investment portfolio in instruments with short maturities or frequent interest rate resets 
we also manage interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents such that we are able to hold investments until maturity 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from the level at december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately
