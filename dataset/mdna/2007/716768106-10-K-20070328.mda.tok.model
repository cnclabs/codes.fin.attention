we complement our extensive product assortment with a wide selection of value added pet services  including grooming  training  boarding and day camp 
all our stores offer complete pet training services  and virtually all our stores feature pet styling salons that provide high quality grooming services 
in fiscal  we began a national roll out of the petshotel concept at selected locations

com  our equine e commerce site and an equine catalog 
on february   we announced our intent to exit the equine product line  including the sale or discontinuation of statelinetack 
com and the equine catalog 
we expect to complete the exit of the equine product line in fiscal executive summary fiscal diluted earnings per common share increased to  on net income of million  compared to diluted earnings per common share of on net income of million in fiscal net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal due to new store openings and an increase in comparable store sales 
we added net new stores during fiscal  and at the end of the fiscal year  operated stores 
in addition  we opened new petshotels during fiscal we expect to open approximately net new stores and new petshotels in fiscal 
table of contents comparable store sales  or sales in stores open at least a year  increased during fiscal on top of a increase during fiscal we project comparable store sales growth in the mid single digits for fiscal services sales increased to million  or of net sales for fiscal services sales increased to million  or of net sales during fiscal gross margins decreased to of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal operating  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal during fiscal  we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million and we declared cash dividends totaling per share 
cash capital expenditures for were million  and we anticipate spending between million and million for capital expenditures in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates for inventory valuation reserves  insurance liabilities and reserves  reserve for closed stores  reserves against deferred tax assets and tax contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation reserves we have established reserves for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventories 
distribution centers and forward distribution centers perform cycle counts encompassing all inventory items at least once every quarter or perform an annual physical inventory 
stores perform physical inventories at least once a year  and between the physical inventories  stores perform counts on certain inventory items 
most of the stores do not perform physical inventories during the last quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday season  but continue to perform counts on certain inventory items 
as of the end of a reporting period  there will be stores with certain inventory items that have not been counted 
for each reporting period presented  we estimate the inventory shrinkage based on a two year historical trend analysis 
changes in shrink results or market conditions could cause actual results to vary from estimates used to establish the inventory reserves 
we also have reserves for estimated obsolescence and to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at their recorded cost 
obsolescence reserves are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value 
factors included in determining obsolescence reserves include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of merchandise  seasonal trends and decisions to discontinue certain products 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may require additional reserves 
as of january  and january   we had inventory valuation reserves of million and million  respectively 

table of contents reserve for closed stores we continuously evaluate the performance of our retail stores and periodically close those that are under performing 
closed stores are generally replaced by a new store in a nearby location 
we establish reserves for future occupancy payments on closed stores in the period the store is closed  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
these costs are classified in operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
we calculate the costs for future occupancy payments  net of expected sublease income  associated with closed stores using the net present value method  at a credit adjusted risk free interest rate  over the remaining life of the lease 
we can make no assurances that additional charges for these stores will not be required based on the changing real estate environment 
as of january  and january   we had stores included in our closed store reserve  of which were under sublease agreements 
in addition to the stores under sublease agreements as of january   we have assumed that five stores will have sublease income in future periods  which represents a million reduction to the reserve 
if these sublease assumptions were extended by a year from the anticipated commencement date of the assumed sublease term  the reserve would increase by approximately million 
we closed stores in fiscal of which one closed as scheduled due to lease expiration and three stores closed under lease termination agreements 
we closed seven stores in fiscal  of which two stores closed as scheduled due to lease expiration and two stores were closed under lease termination agreements 
the closed store reserves were as follows in thousands january  january  total remaining gross occupancy costs less expected sublease income interest costs closed store reserve insurance liabilities and reserves we maintain standard property and casualty insurance on all our properties and leasehold interests  product liability insurance that covers products and the sale of pets  self insured health plans  employer s professional liability and workers compensation insurance 
property insurance covers approximately billion in buildings and contents  including furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements and inventory 
under our casualty and workers compensation insurance policies as of january   we retained an initial risk of loss of million for each policy per occurrence 
we establish reserves for losses based on periodic independent actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses for which claims have been incurred but not reported 
loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events  and changes in such assumptions could result in an adjustment to the reserves 
as of january  and january   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserves related to casualty  self insured health plans  employer s professional liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
income taxes we establish deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance on the deferred income tax assets to reduce the total to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances at january  and january  were principally to offset certain deferred income tax assets for operating and capital loss carryforwards 

table of contents we accrue for potential income tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon our view of the likely outcomes of current and future audits 
we adjust our accrual for income tax contingencies for changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties  such as amendments to existing tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
at january   we had an accrual for income tax contingencies of million 
if the amounts ultimately settled with tax authorities are greater than the accrued contingencies  we must record additional income tax expense in the period in which the assessment is determined 
to the extent amounts are ultimately settled for less than the accrued contingencies  or we determine that a liability to a taxing authority is no longer probable  the contingency is reversed as a reduction of income tax expense in the period the determination is made 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in any of these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
results of operations the following table presents the percent to net sales of certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income fiscal year ended jan

 statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income tax expense income tax expense net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal net sales increased million  or  to billion  compared to net sales of billion in fiscal  due to the addition of net new stores since january  and a increase in comparable store sales for fiscal our comparable store sales growth was for fiscal we believe the increase in our comparable store sales growth rate during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to general economic conditions 
fiscal included a dramatic increase in fuel prices which affected consumer spending 
in addition  we lost days of sales from temporary store closures due to the effect of hurricanes in the third quarter of fiscal services sales  which are included in our net sales and include grooming  training  boarding and day camp operations  increased by  or million  to million 
this increase was primarily due to continued strong demand for our grooming and training services as well as the addition of new petshotels during fiscal gross profit gross profit decreased to of net sales for fiscal from for fiscal 
table of contents services sales increased as a percentage of net sales 
services sales generate lower gross margins than product sales as we include service related labor in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  however  services generate higher operating margins than product sales 
in addition  we opened petshotels in fiscal compared to in fiscal petshotels have higher costs as a percentage of revenue in the first several years 
we also experienced higher redemptions of promotional offers in our petperks program  which are recorded as a reduction in sales  in fiscal compared to fiscal also contributing to the gross profit percentage decline was a revision of our early pay discounts recognition policy 
historically  discounts were recognized as they were taken against payments 
under our revised policy  discounts are recorded as a reduction of inventory and recognized as a reduction in cost of sales as inventory is sold 
we recorded a million charge in the second quarter of fiscal for this change 
we do not anticipate this recognition policy change will have a material impact on our future results of operations 
we also incurred approximately million additional expense in the second and third quarter of fiscal as well as a shift in mix from higher margin hard goods towards consumables primarily in the second quarter of fiscal as we worked through an unplanned re racking project in our phoenix distribution center 
in addition  we had some higher costs in our supply chain to increase service levels to our stores during the holiday season 
these negative margin impacts were partially offset by continued positive results from improved buying practices and pricing initiatives 
in addition  fiscal included charges to increase our inventory obsolescence reserve  and we did not experience the same level of obsolescence expense in fiscal we also capitalized more costs into ending inventory as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to for fiscal from for fiscal net expenses resulting from legal settlements reflected a year over year increase 
fiscal included a million expense to accrue for an ongoing legal proceeding 
fiscal included reductions in expenses from an million legal settlement gain and a million credit card settlement gain 
fiscal also included a reduction in expense due to a correction in stock based compensation 
we accelerated several initiatives  which include strengthening our distribution processes  improving our information systems and investing in our associates and their education  originally planned for fiscal and into also contributing to the increased expenses was the review of a potential acquisition we ultimately chose not to pursue 
other professional fees also increased as we invested in projects to continue to improve our supply chain and information technology infrastructure 
the increased expenses described above were partially offset by several factors 
we saw a decrease in advertising expense due to higher expenses for our mart to smart advertising initiative in fiscal we have also allocated more of our marketing spending to petperks promotional offers in fiscal  which are recorded as a reduction of sales 
depreciation expense in fiscal was lower as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal  as a significant asset reached the end of its depreciable life in fiscal stock compensation expense was lower as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher forfeitures in fiscal as well as a change in forfeiture assumptions for the remaining options and restricted stock 
interest income interest income increased to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal primarily due to higher rates of return on our investments in auction rate securities 
interest expense interest expense increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in capital lease obligations in fiscal 
table of contents income tax expense in fiscal  the million income tax expense represents an effective rate of  compared with fiscal income tax expense of million  which represents an effective tax rate of 
during fiscal  we settled an audit with the internal revenue service 
this included settlement of an affirmative issue we raised during fiscal with respect to the characterization of certain losses 
the settlement resulted in an overall benefit of million 
we also recorded tax benefits of approximately million primarily due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax positions and additional federal and state tax credits 
during fiscal  we recorded a reduction to income tax expense of approximately million as the period of assessment  during which additional tax may be imposed for years prior to fiscal  expired for several jurisdictions 
as a result  we determined that approximately million of tax contingency reserves were no longer required  with approximately million as an increase to additional paid in capital 
we also recorded additional tax expense of approximately million resulting from corrections of our deferred tax assets 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal net sales increased million  or  to billion  compared to net sales of billion in fiscal  due to the addition of net new stores and a increase in comparable store sales for fiscal our comparable store sales growth was for fiscal we believe the decrease in our comparable store sales growth rate during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to general economic conditions  including increased fuel prices  which caused a decrease in consumer spending 
in addition  we lost days of sales from store closures due to the effect of hurricanes in the third quarter of fiscal services sales  which are included in our net sales and include grooming  training  boarding and day camp operations  increased by  or million  to million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in grooming volume during fiscal gross profit gross profit increased as a percentage of net sales to for fiscal  from for fiscal the increase reflects higher margins on product sales due to improved buying practices  our ongoing pricing strategies and increased inventory levels resulting in more of our costs capitalized in inventory 
these increases were partially offset by various fixed and variable expenses in cost of sales including occupancy  warehousing and transportation costs and inventory related costs 
store and occupancy costs increased as we opened more stores and opened our illinois distribution facility 
warehousing and transportation costs increased due to additional variable expenses from our illinois distribution facility and higher fuel prices 
inventory related costs increased due to higher inventory shrinkage results and higher obsolescence charges 
in addition  gross profit on our services decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the increase in variable and infrastructure expenses associated with the opening of new petshotels 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses  or og a  decreased as a percentage of net sales to for fiscal  from for fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by decreases in compensation costs and legal settlements  partially offset by increases in advertising and store opening expenses 
compensation costs decreased as a result of a reduction in stock based compensation recognized  charges incurred in fiscal related to workers compensation reserves which were not incurred at the same levels in fiscal and lower bonus expense recognized in fiscal legal settlements recorded as a reduction of og a expenses were larger in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a one time legal settlement recorded in the first quarter of fiscal and a visa mastercard settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal advertising expenses 
table of contents increased as a result of our mart to smart advertising initiative 
store opening expenses increased as a result of an increase in new store openings and the timing of openings 
interest income interest income increased to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal primarily due to an increase in interest rates 
interest expense interest expense increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in capital lease obligations in fiscal income tax expense for fiscal  income tax expense was million representing an effective rate of 
for fiscal  income tax expense of million represented an effective rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to a tax benefit of million recorded in fiscal related to the expected utilization of million of net operating losses previously considered unavailable 
we also recorded additional tax expense of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and million in the third quarter of resulting primarily from adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
offsetting these increases to the effective rate  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a reduction to income tax expense of million related to reductions in certain tax reserves that we determined would no longer be needed

ars generally have long term maturities beyond three months but are priced and traded as short term instruments 
restricted cash and short term investments  including million in ars  represent funds used to guarantee our letters of credit under our letter of credit facility established during the second quarter of fiscal cash provided by operations decreased million to million in  compared with million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities was generated primarily by net income of million and non cash depreciation and amortization expenses of million and stock based compensation of million

we record occupancy costs as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
licensing fees are determined by fixed costs per square foot  adjusted for the number of days the hospitals are open and sales volumes achieved 
we recognized licensing fees of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we also charge mmih for its portion of specific operating expenses and treat the reimbursement as a reduction of the stores operating expenses 
receivables from mmih totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively  and were included in receivables in the consolidated balance sheets

the credit facility and letter of credit facility are secured by substantially all our personal property assets  our subsidiaries and certain real property 
in february  we increased the letter of credit facility to million 
seasonality and inflation our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we typically realize a higher portion of our net sales and operating profit during the fourth fiscal quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
controllable expenses  such as advertising  could fluctuate from quarter to quarter in a fiscal year 
net sales of certain products and services designed to address pet health needs are seasonal 
because our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area  net sales also may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions  which are more prevalent during certain seasons of the year 
as a result of our expansion plans  the timing of new store openings and related preopening costs  the amounts of net sales contributed by new and existing stores and the timing and estimated obligations of store closures  our quarterly results may fluctuate 
finally  because new stores tend to experience higher payroll  advertising and other store level expenses as a percentage of net sales than mature stores  new store openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until these stores become established 
we expense preopening costs associated with each new location as these costs are incurred 
while neither inflation nor deflation has had  nor do we expect them to have  a material impact on operating results  we can make no assurances that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future
