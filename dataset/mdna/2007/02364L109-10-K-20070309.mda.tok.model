critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue net of contractual allowances and cost recognition including the estimated cost of off site medical claims  allowance for doubtful accounts  loss contracts  professional and general liability self insurance retention  other self funded insurance reserves  legal contingencies  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  and share based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue and cost recognition the company s contracts with correctional institutions are principally fixed price contracts with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing arrangements  such as stop loss provisions and aggregate limits for off site or pharmaceutical costs 
such contracts typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options and generally may be terminated by either party without cause upon proper notice 
revenues earned under contracts with correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are rendered 
cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income when the service is performed 
revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three general categories fixed fee  population based  or cost plus a fee 
for fixed fee contracts  revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service contract irrespective of inmate population 
revenues for population based contracts are calculated either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate multiplied by the average inmate population for the period of service 
for cost plus a fee contracts  revenues are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual fee 
normally  contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a portion of the company s risk related to cost increases 
off site utilization risk is mitigated in the majority of the company s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off site expenses  stop loss provisions  cost plus a fee arrangement or  in some cases  the entire exclusion of certain or all off site service costs 
pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the company s contracts 
typically under the terms of such provisions  the company s revenue under the contract increases to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off site expenses or pharmaceutical costs 
for contracts which include such provisions  the company recognizes the additional revenues that would be due from clients based on its estimates of applicable contract to date costs incurred as compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs 
because such provisions typically specify how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and require all such additional revenue to be ultimately settled based on actual expenses  the additional revenues are initially recorded as unbilled receivables until the time period for billing has been met and actual costs are known 
any differences between the company s estimates of incurred costs and the actual costs are recorded in the period in which such differences become known along with the corresponding adjustment to the amount of recorded additional revenues 
under all contracts  the company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related criteria 
if necessary  the company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined 
revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are recognized upon delivery of the related products 
healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians  nurses and other healthcare professionals including any related benefits and all other direct costs of providing and or administering the managed care including the costs associated with services provided and or administered by off site medical providers  the costs of professional and general liability insurance and other self funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below 
the cost of healthcare services provided  administered or contracted for are recognized in the period in which they are provided and or administered based in part on estimates  including an accrual for estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date 
the company estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using actual utilization data including hospitalization  one day surgeries  physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and their corresponding costs  which are estimated using the average historical cost of such services 
an actuarial analysis is also prepared at least quarterly by an independent actuary to evaluate the adequacy of the company s total accrual related to contracts which have sufficient claims payment history 
the analysis takes into account historical claims experience including the average historical costs and billing lag time for such services and other actuarial data 
additionally  the company s utilization management personnel perform a monthly review of inpatient hospital stays in order to identify any stays which would have a cost in excess of the historical average rates 
once identified  reserves for such stays are determined which take into consideration the specific facts of the stay 
actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the company s current estimates 
the differences could be material if significant adverse fluctuations occur in the healthcare cost structure or the company s future claims experience 
changes in estimates of claims resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made 
in  and  the company recorded decreases of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to its prior year claims liabilities as a result of differences between actual and estimated claims experience 
additionally  reserves have been recorded for the company s self insurance retention for certain reported as well as unreported professional and general liability claims associated with the delivery of medical services and included in accrued expenses and noncurrent portion of accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents the company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred ie  expected future healthcare costs and maintenance costs will exceed anticipated future revenue and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value 
the company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  significant one time events  contractual rights  client funding and or political pressures  discussions with clients and historical experience 
if circumstances change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted and such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period in which they are recorded 
unbilled accounts receivable generally represent additional revenue earned under shared risk contracting models that remain unbilled at each balance sheet date  due to provisions within the contracts governing the timing for billing such amounts 
the company s more significantly aged receivable balances  net of reserves  are discussed below 
beginning in september  management made a decision to temporarily suspend billings to spp customers until certain findings of the audit committee s internal investigation into matters at spp had been reviewed by the company 
primarily as a result of this decision  spp had approximately million in unbilled receivables at december  in february of  spp submitted invoices to its customers for these amounts 
as of february   less than million of these receivables remain outstanding 
with respect to phs accounts receivable  at december   the company had approximately million of billed receivables due from clients whose contracts terminated prior to january  approximately million of this amount is due from clients whose contracts expired prior to january  in addition to the billed receivables due from these former clients  the company also has approximately million of unbilled receivables related to these former clients which represent aggregate risk sharing receivable amounts which remain unbillable at december  based on stated contract terms 
this unbilled receivable amount relates to one client whose contract expired prior to january  the company believes that these receivables are contractually due under the terms of the respective expired contracts and therefore has recorded no additional reserves related to these amounts 
however  due to the age of the receivables and the lack of an ongoing business relationship between the company and the clients  there is a heightened risk of uncollectibility related to these receivables 
the company and its clients will  from time to time  have disputes over amounts billed under the company s contracts 
the company records allowances for doubtful accounts in circumstances where it concludes that a loss from such disputes is probable 
at december   the company is involved in a dispute with a current client where the client has withheld approximately million from payments of receivables due the company 
the company has recorded approximately million of contractual allowances related to this matter which it estimates as the amount due to the client for the period in question related to staffing penalties under the contract 
at december   the company is involved in a dispute with another current client over billed receivables totaling approximately million 
the company has recorded no reserves related to this amount as it believes the risk of loss is not probable 
phs is currently involved in three lawsuits with its former client  baltimore county  maryland the county 
as of december   phs has approximately million of receivables due from this former client  primarily related to services rendered between april  and september  the county has refused to pay phs for these amounts and therefore  on october   phs filed suit against the county in the circuit court for baltimore county  maryland seeking collection of the outstanding receivable balances and damages for breach of contract  quantum meruit and unjust enrichment 
the company believes  in the case of the lawsuit filed in october that it has a valid and meritorious cause of action and  as a result  has concluded that the outstanding receivables  which represent services performed under the relationship between the parties  are probable of collection 
in the case of the two declaratory judgment actions described in part i item legal proceedings  the company believes it has valid contractual and legal arguments  however  an adverse result in either or both of these cases could have a negative impact on the company s ability to collect the outstanding receivable amount 
for more information about the baltimore county contract  see part i item legal proceedings 
as stated in each of the cases above  the company believes the recorded amounts represent valid receivables which are contractually due from clients  and other than the recorded reserves  expects full collection 
however  due to the factors discussed above  there is a heightened risk of uncollectibility related to each of these circumstances which may result in future losses in excess of such reserves 
nevertheless  the company intends to take all necessary and available measures in order to collect these receivables 

table of contents changes in circumstances related to the matters discussed above  or any other receivables  could result in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts or the estimate of contractual adjustments in future periods 
such change  if it were to occur  could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial position in the period in which the change occurs 
loss contracts on a quarterly basis  the company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a loss contract reserve for succeeding periods 
the company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis taking into consideration such factors as future contractual revenue  projected future healthcare and maintenance costs  projected future stop loss insurance recoveries and each contract s specific terms related to future revenue increases as compared to increased healthcare costs 
the projected future healthcare and maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management s estimate of future cost increases 
these estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims experience as previously noted 
maryland department of public safety and correctional services 
the company s contract with the maryland department of public safety and correctional services maryland dps historically underperformed  fluctuating between minimal profitability  break even and losses 
this contract was entered into on july  to provide comprehensive medical services to four regions of the maryland prison system 
the initial term of the contract was for the three years ended june   with the maryland dps having the ability to renew the contract for two additional one year terms 
the second renewal term of the contract expired june  under the terms of the contract  the maryland dps paid the company a flat fee per month with certain limited cost sharing adjustments for staffing costs  primarily nurses  and the cost of medications related to certain specific illnesses 
the company was fully at risk for increases in hospitalization and outpatient costs under the terms of the contract with the maryland dps 
the contract also contained provisions that allowed the maryland dps to assess penalties if certain staffing or performance criteria were not maintained 
the flat fee paid to the company was increased annually based on a portion of the consumer price index 
due to the flat fee nature of this contract  the company s margin under the contract was significantly impacted by changes in healthcare costs  utilization trends or inmate population 
the company incurred losses under this contract in april at a level slightly above expectations 
the losses under the contract increased significantly in may to approximately million for the month 
the primary cause for the increased loss was an unanticipated increase in hospitalization costs beginning in may  resulting from the volume and acuity of services being provided  the number of hiv and mental health patients and the costs associated with current treatment guidelines 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax loss contract charge of million  effective june   which represented its most likely estimate  at that date  of the future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the maryland dps contract through its expiration on june  this increase in the reserve for loss contracts is reflected as a component of income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
this estimate assumed monthly losses under the contract would diminish from the may level  which was viewed as an aberration  to approximately million per month  including allocated overhead  an amount significantly above recent historical levels 
during the third quarter of  the company utilized million of its loss contract reserve  almost entirely due to the underperformance of the maryland dps contract 
while actual monthly losses incurred under the maryland dps contract had trended downward from the record loss in may  losses once again increased in september  driven primarily by off site medical costs 
off site medical costs under the maryland dps contract averaged million per month for june through september  as compared with initial estimates of million per month  based on historical results 
as a result of this new and more severe trend  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million  effective september   to increase its reserve for estimated future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the maryland dps contract until its expiration on june this increase to the loss contract reserve is reflected as a component of income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
a fundamental assumption of the million increase in loss reserve was that the contract would continue to incur on average million per month of off site medical costs through its termination on june  through april  actual losses incurred under the contract approximated the estimated amounts 
in may  off site medical costs incurred under the maryland dps contract increased to million  a level significantly above previous experience 
these increased costs continued in june resulting in the company recording an additional million increase to its reserve for loss contracts 
this pre tax loss contract charge of million is reflected as a component of income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
on june   the company s contract with the maryland dps expired 
subsequent to june   the company no longer has a loss contract reserve 

table of contents baltimore county 
in addition to the maryland dps contract  the company was previously carrying a loss contract reserve for a contract to provide services to a county jail in baltimore county  maryland 
the company contends that the original term of this contract expired on june   without baltimore county the county exercising the first of three  two year renewal options 
on july   the company sent a letter to the county stating its position that the company s contract to provide services expired on june  due to the county s failure to provide such extension notice 
the county is disputing the company s contention and has asserted that it properly exercised the first renewal option and that the term of the contract therefore was through june   with extension options through june  in  the county and phs agreed to have a judicial authority interpret the contract through formal judicial proceedings  and  at the county s request  phs continued to provide healthcare services to the county pending the judicial resolution of the dispute  while reserving all of its rights 
finally  during september  amid reciprocal claims of default  both the company and the county took individual steps to terminate the relationship between or the contract  if it is ultimately determined to be in effect by the appellate court in the proceeding discussed above the parties 
phs contends that it terminated the relationship effective september   due to various breaches by the county 
in november  the circuit court for baltimore county  maryland ruled in favor of the county ruling that the county properly exercised its first  two year renewal option by sending a faxed written renewal amendment to phs on july  phs appealed this ruling 
on december   the maryland court of special appeals i reversed this judgment  ii ruled that the county did not timely exercise its renewal option by its actions of july   and iii remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the county properly exercised the option by its conduct prior to june  an issue not originally decided by the trial court 
phs plans to vigorously pursue its case with respect to this issue and feels that it has valid arguments in its favor 
however  in the event phs is not ultimately successful and the court determines that the contract was renewed due to the conduct of the county prior to june   such an adverse judgment could have a material adverse effect on the other two suits between the county and phs which were discussed previously and therefore on the company s financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations 
for more information about the baltimore county contract  see part i item legal proceedings 
in the course of performing its reviews in future periods  the company might identify additional contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances 
circumstances that might change and result in the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period include interpretations regarding contract termination or expiration provisions  unanticipated adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure  inmate population or the utilization of outside medical services in a contract  where such changes are not offset by increased healthcare revenues 
should a contract be identified as a loss contract in a future period  the company would record  in the period in which such identification is made  a reserve for the estimated future losses that would be incurred under the contract 
the identification of a loss contract in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period in which the reserve is recorded 
professional and general liability self insurance retention as a healthcare provider  the company s business ordinarily results in actions for negligence and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services with the attendant risk of substantial damage awards  or court ordered non monetary relief such as  changes in operating practices or procedures  which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in the company s operating expenses 
the most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging negligent healthcare services or the lack of timely adequate healthcare services 
the company may also be liable  as employer  for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or healthcare professionals with whom it contracts 
the company s contracts generally provide for the company to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the company and its agents 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  the company maintains a primary professional liability insurance program  principally on a claims made basis 
however  the company is effectively self insured resulting from the use of adjustable premium policies in through for and  the company is covered by separate policies each of which contains a retro premium with adjustment based on actual losses after a minimum of months 
for  and  the company is covered by separate policies each of which contains a retro premium with adjustment based on 
table of contents actual losses after a minimum of months 
the company s ultimate premium for its through policies will depend on the final incurred losses related to each of these separate policy periods 
management establishes reserves for the estimated losses that will be incurred under these insurance policies after taking into consideration internal and external counsel evaluations of the merits of the individual claims  analysis of claim history  the estimated reserves recommended by the company s third party administrator and independent actuarial analysis 
any adjustments resulting from the review are reflected in current earnings 
given the fact that many claims are not brought during the year of occurrence  in addition to its reserves for known claims  the company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported claims 
the reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis 
the company s estimates of this reserve are supported by an independent actuarial analysis  which is obtained on a quarterly basis 
at december   the company s reserves for both known and incurred but not reported claims totaled million 
reserves for medical malpractice claims fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next 
furthermore  payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the estimated liability 
changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made 
in  and  the company recorded increases of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to its prior year claims reserves as a result of adverse development 
the reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of the third party insurance carriers used by the company 
if a third party insurance carrier fails to meet its contractual obligations under the agreement with the company  the company would then be responsible for such obligations 
such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 
other self funded insurance reserves as of december   the company has approximately million in accrued liabilities for employee health and workers compensation claims 
approximately million of this amount is related to workers compensation claims  of which approximately million is included within the noncurrent portion of accrued expenses as it is not expected to be paid within a year 
the company is essentially self insured for employee health and workers compensation claims subject to certain individual case stop loss levels 
as such  its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and the ability to control claims 
the company accrues the estimated liability for employee health insurance based on its history of claims experience and estimated time lag between the incident date and the date of actual claim payment 
the company accrues the estimated liability for workers compensation claims based on internal and external evaluations of the merits of the individual claims  analysis of claims history and the estimated reserves assigned by the company s third party administrator 
on a periodic basis  the company obtains an independent actuarial analysis to further support the appropriateness of the workers compensation reserve 
these estimates of self funded insurance reserves could change in the future based on changes in the factors discussed above 
any adjustments resulting from such changes in estimates are reflected in current earnings 
in  and  the company recorded an increase of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million and an increase of approximately million  respectively  to its prior year other self insurance reserves as a result of differences between actual and estimated claims experience 
legal contingencies in addition to professional and general liability claims  the company is also subject to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
such proceedings generally relate to labor  employment or contract matters 
when estimable  the company accrues an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling the company s defense in these matters and are based upon an estimated range of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
the company does not believe any of the current proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
however  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions  new developments or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with such litigation

intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  goodwill acquired is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company performed its annual review as of december  based on the results of this annual review  management has determined that goodwill related to its pharmaceutical distribution services segment is impaired as of december  accordingly  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of no other indication of goodwill impairment was identified 
however  future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the company s goodwill related to its correctional healthcare 
table of contents services segment is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s other identifiable intangible assets  such as customer contracts acquired in acquisitions and covenants not to compete  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the company also assesses the impairment of its other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
important factors taken into consideration when evaluating the need for an impairment review include the following significant underperformance or loss of key contracts relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the company s assets or in the company s overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment or as a result of its annual impairment review  any impairment is measured using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required under the provisions of sfas fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
when the company determines that the carrying value of other intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  any impairment is measured using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
the company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles on at least a quarterly basis  taking into account new facts and circumstances  including its retention rate for acquired contracts 
if such facts and circumstances indicate the current estimated life is no longer reasonable  the company adjusts the estimated useful life on a prospective basis

 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
requires the company to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
it further states forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
from december  to june   the company maintained a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets that can be realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences 
based upon the company s results of operations since december   and its expected profitability in future years  the company concluded  effective june   that it is more likely than not that substantially all of its net deferred tax assets will be realized 
as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
 substantially all of the valuation allowance applied to such net deferred tax assets was reversed in the second quarter of reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in a non cash income tax benefit in the second quarter of totaling million 
this benefit represented the company s estimated realizable deferred tax assets  excluding those deferred tax assets that resulted from the exercise of employee stock options 
the reversal of the valuation allowance that related to the company s estimated realizable deferred tax assets resulting from the exercises of employee stock options totaled million and was recorded as a direct increase to additional paid in capital in the stockholders equity portion of the company s balance sheet as of june  at december  and  the company s valuation allowance of approximately million and million  respectively  represents management s estimate of state net operating loss carryforwards which will expire unused 
the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when  despite the belief that the company s tax return positions are fully supported  the company believes that certain positions will be challenged and a risk exists that the company s positions will not be fully sustained 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of 
table of contents tax audits  case law  and emerging legislation 
adjustments to the tax contingency accruals are recorded in the period in which the new facts or circumstances become known  therefore the accruals are subject to change in future periods and such change  if it were to occur  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in future periods 
the company s tax contingency accruals are reflected as a component of accrued liabilities

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  healthcare revenues 
healthcare revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million in to million in healthcare revenues in included million of revenue growth resulting from new correctional healthcare services contracts added in and through marketing activities 
correctional healthcare services contracts in place at december  and in continuing operations at december   experienced revenue growth of consisting of an increase in revenue of million during as the result of contract renegotiations and automatic price adjustments 
offsetting these revenue increases  spp pharmaceutical distribution revenue decreased million primarily due to the loss of two distribution customers in and one distribution customer in june as discussed in the discontinued operations section below  all healthcare services contracts that have expired or otherwise been terminated subsequent to january  have been classified as discontinued operations 
healthcare expenses 
healthcare expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million in to million in included in the healthcare expenses for the year ended december  is approximately million related to share based compensation expense 
no such share based compensation was recorded in the year ended december  expenses related to new correctional healthcare services contracts added in and through marketing activities accounted for million of the increase 
correctional healthcare services contracts in place at december  and in continuing operations at december  accounted for million of the increase as a result of increases in the levels of staff and staff compensation and increases in the outpatient services and pharmacy costs associated with providing healthcare to inmates at existing contracts 
offsetting these healthcare expense increases  spp pharmaceutical distribution expense decreased million primarily as a result of the decrease in spp pharmaceutical distribution revenue discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ending december  increased million from million  or of revenue  in to million  or of revenue  in included in the selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and is approximately million and million  respectively  related to share based compensation expense 
the share based compensation expense recorded in was related to restricted stock granted to directors in and the increase in share based compensation is due to the adoption of sfas no
