item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary in fiscal  our revenues decreased million or compared with fiscal our commercial business declined during fiscal mostly due to a sharp drop in our rac business  and our military business also declined from prior year levels 
our gross profit also dropped million 
approximately million of this decline was from write downs of inventory to market value principally resulting from a decline in demand and selling price for rac products due to competition from off shore  low cost manufacturers 
the reduction in gross profit from lower revenues was largely offset by a more favorable mix of sales of higher margin products 
operating expenses increased million from fiscal levels  largely due to higher professional fees mostly due to our lawsuit against tower manufacturing corporation and compensation related costs 
other income expense  net  improved million from an expense of 
million to income of million 
the million settlement of the lawsuit with tower manufacturing corporation was the reason for this significant improvement in other income 
in fiscal cash and investments increased 
million from fiscal levels 
overview we are an internationally recognized leader in the design  manufacture and sale of electrical safety products 
we market and sell our products through several channels of distribution including our in house sales force  retail  distribution  domestic and international oems and third party sales representation organizations 
we recognize revenues from equipment sales when evidence of a sales arrangement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  delivery  including title passage has taken place  and collectibility from the customer is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers in sales transactions related to shipping and handling are classified as product revenues 
royalty revenues are recognized when we have delivered technical specifications and performed required services under the related agreement 
during fiscal our sales of rac products were reduced from prior years levels because of increased competition 
our military revenues also declined due to lack of available funding in the us budget late in the government s fiscal year 
our gross margins are affected by many different factors including competitive price pressures  product mix  differences in manufacturing volumes  changes in the cost of raw materials  charges for excess or obsolete inventory  and costs of warranty repairs 
we generally provide a one year warranty on product sales 
we believe that our accrued warranty reserve is adequate to cover the cost of future warranty work on products we have sold 
during fiscal  we wrote down the carrying value of our inventory to market value by million which significantly impacted our gross margins 
these adjustments to market value mainly resulted from reduced demand for our rac products due to increasing competition from off shore  low cost manufacturers 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  bonuses  commissions and related employee expenses for sales personnel  advertising  promotional and trade show expenses  travel  consulting fees  and facilities expense 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries  bonuses and related employee expenses  travel  consulting fees  facilities expense  legal and audit  charge offs of bad debts and board of director fees 
research and development expenses principally include salaries for engineers and technical support staff  consulting  outside testing service fees  maintenance contracts on software  and depreciation of engineering equipment 
our operating expenses increased significantly over the past year 
much of this increase was for legal expenses related to our lawsuit against tower manufacturing corporation that was initiated in the fiscal year 
along with professional fees the most significant reason for operating expense increases was for salary and wage related expense 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods shown years ended march  revenues commercial military royalties total revenues cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development business restructuring charges other total operating expenses income loss from operations interest expense other income income before income taxes income tax expense net income fiscal and comparison revenues for fiscal decreased million  or to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
commercial revenues decreased million largely due to a sharp decrease in rac revenues 
military revenues declined million or to million from million in fiscal the decline in commercial revenue was principally a result of declining rac revenues due to competition from off shore  low cost manufacturers 
the decrease in military revenues was largely attributable to the lack of available funding late in the government s fiscal year 
in fiscal  we expect rac revenues to continue at current levels reducing quarterly commercial revenues to approximately fourth quarter fiscal run rates 
military revenues are anticipated to ramp up in fiscal without government budget restrictions to recent prior years levels 
gross profit decreased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the lower fiscal gross profit was primarily due to the million decrease in revenues and to million in write downs of inventory principally due to a decline in demand and selling price for rac products due to competition from off shore  low cost manufacturers 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues declined 
from for the fiscal year to in fiscal this decline in gross profit as a percent of revenues was primarily due to the write downs of rac inventory as discussed above 
without this write down in inventory  gross profit would have increased approximately largely due to a sales mix of higher margin products 
selling and marketing expense of million  or of revenues  increased 
million for fiscal from million  or of revenues in fiscal the 
million increase over the prior year period was primarily due to increases in compensation expense of 
million  professional fees of 
million and travel of 
million 
selling and marketing expense as a percent of revenues increased principally due to the million decrease in revenues in fiscal as well as the 
million increase in selling and marketing expenses 
we expect selling and marketing expense to decline slightly in fiscal but to increase as a percent of revenues due to the impact of lower rac revenues for the full year 
general and administrative expense was million  or of revenues  for fiscal  compared with million  or of revenues  for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase over the prior year was principally due to 
million in higher professional fees mostly due to the tower lawsuit  
million in higher compensation related expenses  
million in higher write offs of bad debts  and 
million in higher amortization of intangible expenses 
general and administrative expense as a percent of revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the higher legal  compensation  bad debts  and amortization of intangibles expense as well as the million decrease in revenues in fiscal we expect general and administrative expenses to decline in fiscal but with expected lower rac revenues for fiscal we expect general and administrative expenses to be approximately as a percentage of revenues 
research and development expense was million of expense in both fiscal and fiscal research and development expense was as a percent of revenues for the fiscal year ended march  compared with for the fiscal year ended march  the increase is due to the million decrease in revenues in fiscal we expect research and development expense as a percent of revenues to remain approximately the same in fiscal compared with fiscal restructuring charges were 
million in expense in fiscal versus for fiscal in march  we reduced our us workforce by approximately in order to adjust our cost structure to be more competitive due to the loss of rac revenues 
there were no comparable restructuring charges in fiscal other operating expenses consisted of 
million or 
of revenues in fiscal compared with in fiscal other operating expense consisted of a write down in assets to fair market value 
other income expense  net was million in income in fiscal versus 
million in expense in fiscal  an increase in income of million 
the increase in other income was primarily attributable to the patent infringement lawsuit settlement of million that was recorded in the third quarter 
in addition  interest expense declined from the prior year due to lower loan balances outstanding 
income tax expense decreased 
million to 
million of expense for fiscal from 
million in fiscal the decrease was principally due to higher income tax expense in fiscal resulting from a deemed dividend from our honduran subsidiary to the us parent company under sections and of the internal revenue code that resulted from borrowings under our joint line of credit with our honduran subsidiary 
fiscal income taxes were reduced by the reversal of a tax accrual in the amount of 
million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of concluding an audit by the internal revenue service for the fiscal year 
income tax expense as a percent of income before income taxes was for fiscal  compared with in fiscal historically our effective tax rate has varied based on the mix of income before income taxes derived from our honduran subsidiary  which had not been subject to income taxes  and the balance of income before income taxes  which is subject to income taxes 
our honduran subsidiary is profitable which decreases our effective tax rate 
in fiscal and the earnings from foreign operations were taxable as deemed dividends to the parent company due to borrowings under our revolving credit agreement that were secured by the assets of the honduran subsidiary 
at each reporting period  we make our best estimate of the effective tax rate expected for the full fiscal year and apply that rate to the current year to date income before income taxes 
any difference between the current and preceding estimated effective tax rate expected for the full fiscal year is reflected as an adjustment in the current quarter s income tax expense 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  prior to fiscal we did not record deferred income taxes on the foreign undistributed earnings of an investment in a foreign subsidiary that are essentially permanent in duration 
we expect our effective income tax rate to be between in fiscal net income was million for fiscal  compared with million reported in fiscal  a decrease of 
million 
lower fiscal revenues and gross profit and higher fiscal operating expenses were largely offset by the million settlement of the patent infringement lawsuit and the lower income tax provision when compared with fiscal fiscal and comparison revenues for fiscal increased million  or to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
commercial revenues  including rac revenues  increased million reflecting solid growth in most channels of distribution in both domestic and international markets 
military revenues increased million or to million from million in fiscal royalty income declined 
million to zero income in fiscal the decline in royalty income was due to non recurring royalties which were recorded in the prior year not repeated in fiscal gross profit increased 
million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the higher gross profit in fiscal was due to the million increase in revenues partially offset by lower margins on rac sales as a result of competitive pressure  a less favorable product mix and price increases from vendors 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues declined from for the fiscal year to in fiscal this decline in gross profit as a percent of revenues was also due to the lower margins on rac sales  the more unfavorable product mix in fiscal  and price increases from vendors 
selling and marketing expense of million  or of revenues  increased 
million for fiscal  compared with million  or of revenues  for fiscal the 
million increase over the comparable period was primarily due to increases in compensation expense in fiscal selling and marketing expense as a percent of revenues declined 
principally due to the million increase in revenues in fiscal we expect selling and marketing expense as a percent of revenues to remain approximately the same in fiscal as in fiscal general and administrative expense was million  or of revenues  for fiscal  compared with million  or of revenues  for fiscal  an increase of 
million  or 
the increase over the prior year was principally due to 
million in higher legal expense  of which 
million is a result of the tower lawsuit  
million in higher compensation  and 
million in higher consulting fees 
general and administrative expense as a percent of revenues increased 
from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the higher legal  compensation and consulting fees partially offset by the million increase in revenues in fiscal research and development expense was million of expense in both fiscal and fiscal research and development expense was as a percent of revenues for the fiscal year ended march  compared with for the fiscal year ended march  the 
decrease is due to the million increase in revenues in fiscal we expect research and development expense as a percent of revenues to remain approximately the same in fiscal compared with fiscal other expense was 
million in expense in fiscal  an increase of 
million in expense from fiscal the increase was principally due to interest expense related to the higher level of borrowings on our line of credit for the entire fiscal year  whereas in fiscal  we had lower debt at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we expect to have decreased debt in fiscal compared to fiscal income tax expense decreased 
million to 
million of expense for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease was principally due to higher income tax expense in fiscal resulting from a deemed dividend from our honduran subsidiary to the us parent company under sections and of the internal revenue code that resulted from borrowings under our joint line of credit with our honduran subsidiary and deferred income taxes recorded on pre fiscal honduran earnings due to inability to assert the indefinite reversal criteria of apb the income tax impact in fiscal was approximately 
million higher due recording deferred income taxes on pre fiscal honduran earnings 
the company was able to reassert the indefinite reversal criteria for honduran earnings within the fourth quarter of fiscal  which decreased income taxes by approximately 
million 
income taxes also decreased in fiscal due to the reversal of a tax accrual in the amount of 
million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of concluding an audit by the internal revenue service for the fiscal year 
income tax expense as a percent of income before income taxes was for fiscal  compared with in fiscal the higher percentage of income tax expense as a percent of income before income taxes in fiscal is primarily due to deferred income taxes recorded on pre fiscal honduran earnings due to inability to assert the indefinite reversal criteria of apb historically our effective tax rate has varied based on the mix of income before income taxes derived from our honduran subsidiary  which had not been subject to income taxes  and the balance of income before income taxes  which is subject to income taxes 
our honduran subsidiary is profitable which decreased our effective tax rate in years prior to fiscal in fiscal and the earnings from foreign operations were taxable as deemed dividends to the parent company due to borrowings under our revolving credit agreement that were secured by the assets of the honduran subsidiary 
at each reporting period  we make our best estimate of the effective tax rate expected for the full fiscal year and apply that rate to the current year to date income before income taxes 
any difference between the current and preceding estimated effective tax rate expected for the full fiscal year is reflected as an adjustment in the current quarter s income tax expense 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  we do not record deferred income taxes on the foreign undistributed earnings of an investment in a foreign subsidiary that are essentially permanent in duration 
the circumstances that triggered the taxation of foreign earnings are no longer in effect 
as it is management s intent to reinvest future undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary and thereby indefinitely postpone their repatriation  our effective income tax rate was lower in fiscal net income was million for fiscal  compared with million reported in fiscal  an increase of 
million 
higher fiscal gross profit and the lower tax provision discussed above were partially offset by higher operating expense and higher interest expense when compared with fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures  in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes i we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and ii different estimates that we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimates actually used resulting from events that could be reasonably foreseen as likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements once known 
in addition  we are periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled disclosure regarding forward looking statements and in section item a above  entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenue from commercial customers when an order has been received and accepted  pricing is fixed  delivery has occurred and title to the product has passed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title generally passes upon shipment to the customer  however  in a limited number of cases  title passes upon receipt of shipment by the customer 
we have no installation obligation subsequent to product shipment 
similarly  revenues from sales to distributors are recognized as title passes to them without additional involvement or obligation 
collection of receivables related to distributor sales is not contingent upon subsequent sales to third parties 
we may enter into government contracts that fall within the scope of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop non standard products or fall outside the scope of sop standard products 
for government contracts within the scope of sop  we record revenue under a units of delivery model with revenues and costs equal to the average unit value times the number of units delivered 
any estimated loss on an overall contract would be recognized in the period determined in accordance with sop for government contracts outside the scope of sop  we record revenue the same as for commercial customers discussed above and would record a loss in the event the costs to fulfill a government contract are in excess of the associated revenues 
we have not experienced past losses on government contracts  and currently  we do not have any transactions being accounted for within the scope of sop we record an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make timely payments of amounts due on account of product purchases 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information  including publicly available credit data  subscription based credit reports  trade association data  and analyzes factors such as historical bad debt experience  changes in customer payment terms or payment patterns  credit risk related to industry and geographical location and economic trends 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional write offs could be required  resulting in write offs not included in our current allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories 
because of the lead times required to obtain certain raw materials  we must maintain sufficient quantities on hand to meet expected product demand for each of our many products 
if actual demand is much lower than forecasted  we may not be able to dispose of our inventory at or above our cost 
we write down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete amounts to the lower of cost or market 
we review the reasonableness of our estimates each quarter or more frequently 
a reserve is established for inventory that has had no activity for long periods of time or for which management believes is no longer salable 
this reserve is reviewed and approved by the senior management team 
in the future  based on our quarterly analysis  if we estimate that any remaining reserve for obsolescence is either inadequate or in excess of the inventory reserve required  we may need to adjust it 
at present  based on our analysis  we believe the reserve is properly valued for the inventory held by us 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of any accrual for tax contingencies  any foreign withholding taxes or any united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiary  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required to be applied against the deferred tax assets 
it had been management s intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary and thereby indefinitely postpone their repatriation 
accordingly  prior to fiscal no provision had been made for foreign withholding taxes or united states income taxes which would become payable if undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary are paid to us as dividends 
in fiscal and fiscal  pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  approximately million of current year and prior undistributed earnings of our honduran subsidiary were deemed dividends to the parent company and subject to us income tax 
accordingly a provision was recorded for all of the taxes attributable to these deemed dividends in fiscal and fiscal the circumstances that triggered the taxation of our foreign earnings no longer exist and it is our intention to reinvest future undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary and thereby indefinitely postpone their repatriation 
we apply the comparable profits method for transfer pricing to determine the amounts our subsidiary charges to the parent 
warranty 
we generally provide a one year warranty period for all of our products 
we also provide coverage on certain of our surge products for downstream damage of products not manufactured by us 
our warranty provision represents our estimate of probable liabilities  calculated as a function of sales volume and historical repair experience for each product under warranty 
our warranty accrual represents our estimate of our liability for warranty repairs that we will incur over the warranty period 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for possible impairment of carrying value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefit of our assets  management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to be derived from the use of individual assets over their remaining amortization period 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its anticipated undiscounted cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between its carrying value and its fair value 
the discussion below contains forward looking statements about our expectations of what could happen in the future 
forward looking statements involve uncertainties and risk and our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward looking statements due to many known and unknown factors  including but not limited to those previously discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report
