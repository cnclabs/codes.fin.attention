table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the purpose of this discussion and analysis  the words we  us  our  and the company are used to refer to new york community bancorp  inc and our consolidated subsidiaries  including new york community bank and new york commercial bank 
executive summary with total assets of billion at december   we are the fourth largest publicly traded bank holding company headquartered in the new york metropolitan region  and one of its leading depositories 
we currently have banking offices serving customers in all five boroughs of new york city  suffolk and nassau counties on long island  westchester county  and the northern new jersey counties of essex  hudson  and union 
our two primary subsidiaries are new york community bank  a new york state chartered savings bank with locations that span our entire market  and new york commercial bank  a new york state chartered commercial bank with locations serving customers in manhattan  queens  and brooklyn  westchester county  and long island 
for the purpose of the discussion and analysis that follow  new york community bank and new york commercial bank are referred to collectively as the banks and respectively as the community bank and the commercial bank 
as noted in the overview earlier in this report  our financial performance was driven by a business model with five key components the origination of multi family mortgage loans  primarily on rent regulated buildings in new york city  the maintenance of credit standards that have resulted in a solid record of asset quality  the efficient operation of our company  including our retail branch network  the growth of our franchise through accretive merger transactions  and the strategic post merger repositioning of our balance sheet 
our focus on this model resulted in the following achievements over the course of the year multi family loans totaled billion at the end of december  signifying a billion  or  increase from the year earlier amount 
while the acquisition of atlantic bank contributed million of multi family loans at the date of acquisition  the increase was largely due to organic loan production  with originations totaling billion in multi family loans represented of total loans at the end of december and of loans produced over the course of the year 
our solid record of asset quality was extended over the course of the year  with non performing assets representing million  or  of total assets at the end of december  an improvement from million  or of total assets  at december  included in the december  amount were non performing loans of million  representing of total loans at that date 
notwithstanding the establishment of a commercial banking franchise and the related addition of branches  we maintained a strong level of efficiency 
according to snl financial  we ranked th among the most efficient publicly traded banks and thrifts in the nation  with an efficiency ratio of in we commenced operations of our commercial bank subsidiary with the acquisition of long island financial corp 
long island financial on december   and expanded the commercial bank with the acquisition of atlantic bank of new york atlantic bank on april  the acquisitions diversified our balance sheet  expanded our franchise  and enhanced our ability to compete for loans and deposit market share 
the long island financial transaction provided us with assets of million  including loans of million and securities of million  and deposits of million  including million of lower cost and non interest bearing deposits 
the atlantic bank transaction provided us with assets of billion  including loans of billion and securities of billion  and deposits of billion  including billion of core deposits defined as now and money market accounts  savings accounts  and non interest bearing accounts 

table of contents in addition  the atlantic bank transaction strengthened our presence in the attractive manhattan market  where the majority of the properties securing our multi family loans are located  and enhanced our ability to meet our borrowers and other local businesses needs by expanding our menu of cash management services 
furthermore  the commercial bank acquisitions provided us with an opportunity to reduce our higher cost funding sources  as we engaged in a post merger repositioning of our balance sheet  as further discussed below 
in november  we successfully completed an upgrade of the commercial bank s core data processing systems  enabling customers at the twelve branches acquired in the long island financial transaction and customers at the branches acquired in the atlantic bank transaction to conduct their banking businesses at all branches of our commercial bank subsidiary 
on november   we announced plans to acquire pennfed financial services  inc pennfed  the holding company for penn federal savings bank  a new jersey based savings institution with assets of billion  deposits of billion  and branch offices as of december  pending the approval of pennfed s shareholders and the receipt of customary regulatory approvals  we currently expect to complete the acquisition on or about march  on february   the merger of penn federal savings bank with and into the community bank received fdic approval  the merger is expected to take place immediately following the acquisition of pennfed by the company 
while the establishment of the commercial bank had a favorable impact on our performance  the benefits were overshadowed by the adverse impact of the challenging interest rate environment 
the inversion of the yield curve at the end of became more acute in the twelve months that followed  as short term interest rates rose at a faster pace than intermediate term interest rates 
in addition  the comparatively low level of market interest rates inhibited loan refinancing activity until late in the fourth quarter  reducing the volume of prepayment penalties we received over the course of the year 
prepayment penalties totaled million in  as compared to million in competition for product placed additional pressure on our earnings  as new competitors offered multi family loans at loan to value ratios that exceeded our maximum measures  leading to our decision to pass on loans we might otherwise have refinanced or added to our portfolio 
at the same time  competition for deposits was exacerbated by the continuing rise in short term interest rates  which contributed to an increase in our funding costs 
to temper the impact of these adverse market conditions  and to position ourselves for  we took the following strategic actions in with the acquisition of atlantic bank at the end of april  we boosted our deposits by billion 
of this amount  billion  or  consisted of low cost or non interest bearing deposits 
within weeks of completing the atlantic bank acquisition  we sold billion of securities acquired in that transaction and in the acquisition of long island financial  combined 
during the second quarter  we utilized the proceeds of these securities sales to repay million of wholesale borrowings with an average cost of  and also reduced our balance of brokered deposits by million 
in the fourth quarter of  we utilized the cash flows produced through an increase in loan repayments to reduce our brokered deposits by million 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we redeemed million of junior subordinated debentures featuring a floating rate of interest equal to the three and six month london interbank offered rate libor plus a range of to 
to fund the redemptions  we issued million of junior subordinated debentures featuring a floating rate of interest equal to the three month libor plus 
the benefits of these actions are reflected in the following year over year improvements in our balance sheet at december  reflecting the assets acquired with atlantic bank and organic loan production  we recorded total assets of billion  signifying a billion  or  increase from the balance recorded at year end loans represented billion  or  of total assets at the end of december  signifying a year over year increase of billion  or while the atlantic bank transaction contributed billion to the loan portfolio at the date of acquisition  the year over year increase in loans was primarily fueled by the loans we ourselves produced 
originations totaled billion in  and included billion of loans secured by multi family buildings  as well as million and million  respectively  of commercial real estate and construction loans 
largely reflecting the benefit of the atlantic bank transaction  commercial and industrial c i loans rose million to million 
while c i loans represented a modest of outstanding loans at december st  they represented million  or  of the year s originations  with much of the volume occurring in the fourth quarter of consistent with our use of securities as a source of cash flows  the portfolio of securities declined million  or  year over year  to billion  representing of total assets at december  loan growth was partly fueled by loan repayments totaling billion and by the cash flows from securities sales and repayments 
in  the cash flows from securities sales totaled billion  with repayments totaling million over the course of the year 
deposits totaled billion at year end  and included certificates of deposit cds of billion and core deposits of billion 
included in total deposits were brokered deposits of million  signifying a million  or  reduction from the year end amount 
stockholders equity rose million year over year to billion  and was equivalent to of total assets and a book value of per share  based on  shares 
tangible stockholders equity rose million year over year to billion and equaled of tangible assets  an increase from at december  the increase reflects total contributions to capital of million over the twelve month period and the issuance of million shares of common stock in a secondary offering to fund the acquisition of atlantic bank 
reflecting the strength of our tangible capital  we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at per share throughout the year 
while our balance sheet reflects the benefits of our strategic actions  our income statement largely reflects the adverse impact of the inverted yield curve on our net interest income  and the impact of several charges that were recorded during the year in non interest income and non interest expense net interest income declined million in to million  while our net interest margin declined basis points to for the year 
while interest income rose million year over year 
table of contents to billion  the increase was exceeded by a million rise in interest expense to million 
the rise in interest income was attributable to a billion increase in the average balance of interest earning assets to billion and a basis point increase in the average yield to 
the rise in interest expense was attributable to a billion increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities to billion and an basis point increase in the average cost of funds to 
while our net interest margin declined year over year  a comparison of our margin from quarter to quarter reflects a more positive trend 
as the year progressed  our margin remained fairly stable  the result of our efforts to reduce our higher cost funding sources and the replenishment of our interest earning asset mix with multi family and other higher yielding loans 
non interest income contributed million to our earnings  with fee income accounting for million  boli income accounting for million  and other income accounting for million 
while the level of non interest income recorded in declined million from the year earlier level  the reduction was largely due to a million pre tax mark to market loss on interest rate swaps recorded in the first quarter and a million pre tax loss recorded in connection with the redemption of trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter of the year 
on an after tax basis  these charges were equivalent to million  or per diluted share 
the revenues produced by net interest income and non interest income in were partly offset by non interest expense totaling million  including operating expenses of million  core deposit intangible cdi amortization of million  and a pre tax post merger repositioning charge of million  which was equivalent on an after tax basis to million  or per diluted share 
operating expenses rose million year over year  largely reflecting the establishment of our commercial bank and the related expansion of our staff and branch network 
also included in operating expenses were a million charge for the allocation of employee stock ownership plan esop shares in connection with the atlantic bank transaction  and a million charge recorded in connection with the retirements of our chairman and our senior lending consultant in the fourth quarter of the year 
together  these charges were equivalent on an after tax basis to million  or per diluted share 
cdi amortization rose million in  reflecting the cdi stemming from the acquisitions of long island financial and atlantic bank 
income tax expense declined million to million  a function of the reduction in pre tax income and a reduction in the effective tax rate to from 
the combined impact of the charges recorded in non interest income and non interest expense  on an after tax basis  was million  or per diluted share 
reflecting the decline in net interest income and the combined impact of these charges  we recorded earnings of million  or per diluted share 
looking forward the actions we took in have positioned us well for  as reflected in the enhancements to our balance sheet at the end of december  and the stabilization of our net interest margin over the course of the year 
in addition  our fourth quarter results reflected several encouraging trends  including an increase in prepayment penalties as refinancing activity increased  which contributed to a modest linked quarter improvement in both our margin and interest rate spread 
the pending acquisition of pennfed will provide new opportunities to enhance our margin and our earnings  as we plan to reposition the post merger balance sheet 
upon completion of the transaction  we expect to sell or securitize the majority of pennfed s one to four family loans and to sell a portion of its securities 
the proceeds generated by such actions will be utilized to originate multi family loans and other higher yielding credits  and or to reduce the balance of our higher cost sources of funds 
furthermore  with the addition of pennfed s branches  we will have locations serving the new york metropolitan region  and the opportunity to grow not only our customer base  but also our revenues 

table of contents recent events redemption of trust preferred securities on february   we announced that two of our subsidiaries  haven capital trust i haven trust i and roslyn preferred trust i roslyn trust i  will redeem all of their respective trust preferred securities 
haven trust i will redeem all million of its fixed rate trust preferred securities on april  and roslyn trust i will redeem all million of its floating rate trust preferred securities on the same date 
we expect to fund the redemptions with the proceeds of a new issue of trust preferred securities in april pending acquisition of pennfed financial services  inc as previously stated  the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire pennfed  the holding company for penn federal savings bank  on november  pending the approval of pennfed s shareholders and the receipt of customary regulatory approvals  the acquisition is currently expected to be completed on or about march  on february   the merger of penn federal savings bank with and into the community bank received fdic approval 
the merger is expected to take place immediately following the acquisition of pennfed by the company 
a special meeting of pennfed s shareholders to consider and approve the merger is scheduled for march  critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as being critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
certain accounting policies are considered to be important to the portrayal of our financial condition  since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the inherent sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  and the judgments  estimates  and assumptions used therein  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provisions for loan losses charged to operations and reduced by net charge offs or reversals 
a separate loan loss allowance is established for each of the community bank and the commercial bank and  except as otherwise noted below  the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses is the same for each 
management establishes the allowances for loan losses through an assessment of probable losses in each of the respective loan portfolios 
several factors are considered in this process  including historical and projected default rates and loss severities  internal risk ratings  loan size  economic  industry  and environmental factors  and loan impairment  as defined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
under sfas nos 
and  a loan is classified as impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan 
we apply sfas nos 
and to all loans except smaller balance homogenous loans and loans carried at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value 
in establishing the loan loss allowances  management also considers the banks current business strategies and credit processes  including compliance with stringent guidelines established by the respective boards of directors with regard to credit limitations  loan approvals  underwriting criteria  and loan workout procedures 
in accordance with the pertinent policies  the allowances for loan losses are segmented to correspond to the various types of loans in the loan portfolios 
these loan categories are assessed with specific emphasis on the internal risk ratings  underlying collateral  credit underwriting  and loan size 
these factors correspond to the respective levels of quantified and inherent risk 
the assessments take into consideration loans that have been adversely rated  primarily through the valuation of the collateral supporting each loan 
adversely rated loans are loans that are either non performing or that exhibit certain weaknesses that could jeopardize payment in accordance with the original terms 
larger loans are 
table of contents assigned risk ratings based upon a routine review of the credit files  while smaller loans exceeding days in arrears are assigned risk ratings based upon an aging schedule 
quantified risk factors are assigned for each risk rating category to provide an allocation to the overall loan loss allowance 
the remainder of each loan portfolio is then assessed  by loan type  with similar risk factors being considered  including the borrower s ability to pay and our past loan loss experience with each type of loan 
these loans are also assigned quantified risk factors  which result in allocations to the allowances for loan losses for each particular loan or loan type in the portfolio 
in order to determine their overall adequacy  each of the respective loan loss allowances is reviewed quarterly by management and by the mortgage and real estate committee of the community bank s board of directors or the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank  as applicable 
each of the independent directors who serve on these committees has had more than years of complementary experience 
other factors and processes considered in determining the appropriate level of the allowances for loan losses include  but are not limited to end of period levels and observable trends in non performing loans  charge offs experienced over prior periods  including an analysis of the underlying factors leading to the delinquencies and subsequent charge offs if any  periodic inspections of the loan collateral by qualified in house property appraisers inspectors  as applicable  regular meetings of executive management with the pertinent board committee  during which observable trends in the local economy and or the real estate market are discussed  full assessment by the pertinent board of directors of the aforementioned factors when making a business judgment regarding the impact of anticipated changes on the future level of the allowance for loan losses  and analysis of the portfolio in the aggregate  as well as on an individual loan basis  taking into consideration payment history  underwriting analyses  and internal risk ratings 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the respective loan loss allowances may be necessary  based on changes in economic and local market conditions beyond management s control 
in addition  the community bank and or the commercial bank may be required to take certain charge offs and or recognize additions to their loan loss allowances  based on the judgment of regulatory agencies with regard to information provided to them during their examinations 
investment securities the securities portfolio consists of mortgage related securities  and debt and equity other securities 
securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the market values of our securities  particularly our fixed rate securities  are affected by changes in market interest rates 
in general  as interest rates rise  the market value of fixed rate securities will decline  as interest rates fall  the market value of fixed rate securities will increase 
we conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its carrying value is other than temporary 
estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values 
if we deem any decline in value to be other than temporary  the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged against earnings 
goodwill impairment goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment  rather than amortized  at the reporting unit level  at least once a year 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount at the time of testing  the goodwill 
table of contents of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
according to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
differences in the identification of reporting units and in valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  we have identified one reporting unit 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of january   and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value  using the quoted market price of our common stock on the impairment testing date as the basis for determining fair value 
as of the annual impairment test date  there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
in addition  we found no indication of goodwill impairment when we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of january  income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based on the amount we expect to owe the various tax authorities ie  federal  state  and local 
income taxes represent the net estimated amount due to  or to be received from  such taxing authorities 
in estimating income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions  taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
in this process  management also relies on tax opinions  recent audits  and historical experience 
although we use available information to record income taxes  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances such as changes in tax laws and judicial guidance influencing our overall tax position 
in january  the governor of the state of new york released a budget proposal which included a number of tax provisions that  if enacted  might adversely impact the new york state and city tax liabilities of the company 
the proposals include i elimination of a favorable adjustment in the wage component of the new york apportionment formula determining the income attributable to new york  ii elimination of the reserve method for determining deductions for bad debts and a recapture tax on certain bad debt adjustments recorded over the past five years  iii elimination of a favorable adjustment used in the computation of certain income from subsidiary capital  and iv disallowance of certain deductions attributable to untaxed income from subsidiary capital 
the legislative process is ongoing and some or all of these proposals may be adopted  altered  or abandoned 
we believe that the provisions currently contained in the budget proposal  if enacted  would not have a material adverse impact on our tax expense 
balance sheet summary loans loans are  and have historically been  the company s principal asset  with multi family loans long representing our primary lending niche 
we are the leading producer of multi family loans for portfolio in new york city  with an emphasis on loans secured by buildings that are rent controlled or stabilized 
according to the nyc rent guidelines board housing supply report  of the city s rental housing market in consisted of rent regulated units  a modest increase from the reported for to diversify our lending mix  we also originate commercial real estate and construction loans on properties throughout the new york metropolitan region  but primarily in new york city and nassau and suffolk counties on long island 
while we also originate one to four family loans  we do so on a pass through basis only  selling such loans to a third party conduit shortly after the loans are closed 
the establishment of the commercial bank through the long island financial and atlantic bank acquisitions has enabled us to further diversify our loan portfolio 
in addition to adding c i loans to our mix of assets  the transactions provided us with a team of seasoned lenders with commercial lending expertise 
as a result  we now have an expanded menu of loans and revolving lines of credit to address the needs of the region s small and mid size businesses 

table of contents at december   our loan portfolio totaled billion  signifying a billion  or  increase from the balance recorded at december  while atlantic bank had total loans of billion at the time of the acquisition  the year over year growth of our loan portfolio was primarily fueled by organic loan production  with originations totaling billion 
reflecting our focus on maintaining our credit standards in the face of what we believe to have been irrational pricing and financing in a highly competitive market  the latter amount reflects a billion decline from the volume of loans produced in multi family loan originations accounted for of loans produced over the current twelve month period  with commercial real estate and construction loans accounting for and  respectively 
reflecting the establishment of the commercial bank  c i loan originations totaled million and represented of loans produced in the growth of the loan portfolio was partly tempered by repayments totaling billion and sales of one to four family loans totaling million to our third party conduit 
primarily reflecting the manner in which the vast majority of our multi family  commercial real estate  and construction loans are structured  of our outstanding loans consisted of adjustable rate credits  with fixed rate loans accounting for the remaining

although the volume of loans produced declined in from the year earlier volume of billion  the decrease was strategic in nature and indicative of our decision not to originate product at the excessive loan to value ratios that were prevalent in our market in the second half of the year 
at december   billion  or  of our multi family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings and billion  or  were secured by underlying mortgages on cooperative apartment buildings 
in addition  of our multi family loans were secured by buildings in new york city  with manhattan accounting for the largest percentage  
another of multi family loans were secured by buildings on long island and in other parts of new york state and new jersey  with the remaining secured by buildings outside our immediate market  many of which are owned by borrowers we have made loans to successfully within our local marketplace 
we primarily base the amount of the multi family loans we originate on the current cash flows produced by the building  utilizing the income method of appraising the properties  rather than the sales method  which is subject to fluctuations in real estate market conditions and the general economy 
we also consider a variety of other factors  including the value and condition of the underlying property  the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio  which is the ratio of the property s net operating income to its debt service  and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the property 
the amount of a multi family loan generally may represent no more than of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property  with an amortization period of up to years 
we also require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of on multi family buildings  a security interest in the personal property at the premises  and an assignment of rents 
at december   the average multi family loan had a balance of million  unchanged from the year earlier average  and the portfolio had an average loan to value ratio of  as compared to in the prior year 
in addition to qualifying a multi family loan on the basis of the building s income and condition  we consider the borrower s credit history  profitability  and building management expertise 
because of our longevity in the multi family market and the tendency of borrowers to refinance  we also are able  in many cases  to consider our own prior experience with the owner of the property 
borrowers are required to present evidence of the ability to repay the loan from the building s rent rolls  and a history of making mortgage payments in accordance with the terms of prior and existing loans 
in assessing the creditworthiness of the borrower  we also generally review his or her financial statements and related documents 

table of contents multi family loans are typically made to long term property owners who utilize the funds they borrow to make improvements to the building and the apartments therein 
our multi family loans generally feature a term of ten years  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan  and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten 
the rate charged in the first five years is generally based on the five year constant maturity treasury rate the five year cmt plus a margin of basis points  during years six through ten  the borrower has the option of selecting a monthly adjustable rate that is currently basis points above the prime rate of interest  as reported in the new york times  or a fixed rate that is currently basis points above the five year cmt 
the latter option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the then outstanding loan amount 
the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five year term 
as improvements are made to the collateral property  the regulations permit an increase in the rents on the apartments  thus creating more cash flows for the owner to borrow against 
as the rent roll increases  the property owner typically opts to refinance the loan  even in a rising interest rate environment 
this cycle has repeated itself over the course of many decades  with property values increasing  and borrowers typically refinancing before the loan reaches its sixth year 
accordingly  the expected weighted average life of the multi family loan portfolio was years at december  multi family loans that refinance within the first five years are subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule 
depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment  the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the loan balance 
because a portion of the loans in the portfolio tend to refinance with us  the potential for future portfolio growth is enhanced with every new loan we originate 
our emphasis on multi family loans is driven by several factors  including their structure  which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree 
another factor driving our focus on multi family loans is the consistent quality of these assets we have not had a loss of principal on a multi family loan in our niche for more than twenty five years 
we generally consider multi family loans to involve a modest degree of credit risk as compared to other types of credits  since the loans we produce are typically collateralized by rent regulated buildings which tend to be stable and fully occupied 
because the buildings securing the loans are generally well maintained  and because the rents are typically below market  occupancy levels remain more or less constant  even during times of economic adversity 
the approval process for multi family loans is also highly efficient  typically taking a period of four to eight weeks 
we have been originating multi family loans for several decades and were one of the few banks in the region to continue producing such loans during the last downturn in the credit cycle 
our success in this lending niche reflects the solid relationships we have developed during this time with the market s leading mortgage brokers  who are familiar with our lending practices  our underwriting standards  and our long standing practice of lending on the cash flows produced by the buildings collateralizing these loans 
because the multi family market is largely broker driven  the process of producing such loans is significantly expedited and the related expenses substantially reduced 
commercial real estate loans commercial real estate loans totaled billion at december   representing of total loans outstanding and a million  or  increase from the balance recorded at december  in addition to the commercial real estate loans acquired in the atlantic bank transaction  which totaled million at the date of acquisition  the increase reflects twelve month originations totaling million  down million from the year earlier amount 
at december   of our commercial real estate loans were secured by properties in new york city  with properties on long island accounting for another 
we structure our commercial real estate loans along the same lines as our multi family credits  ie  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan that is generally tied to the five year cmt plus a margin of to basis points 
for years six through ten  the borrower generally has the option of selecting a monthly adjustable rate that is currently basis points above the prime rate of interest  or a fixed rate that is currently 
table of contents basis points above the five year cmt 
the latter option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the then outstanding loan amount 
the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate featured in the initial five year term 
prepayment penalties also apply  with five percentage points generally being charged on loans that refinance in the first year  scaling down to one percentage point on loans that refinance in year five 
our commercial real estate loans also tend to refinance within five years of origination  and the expected weighted average life of the portfolio was years at december  the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties 
in addition  a decline in real estate values or in economic conditions could have a greater impact on the ability of a borrower to repay a commercial real estate loan than a residential mortgage loan 
to minimize the risk involved  we originate commercial real estate loans in adherence with stringent underwriting standards  and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property s income stream and debt service coverage ratio 
accordingly  the amount of each loan is based upon the net operating income produced by the collateral property  and generally may not exceed of the appraised value thereof 
the approval of a loan also depends on the borrower s credit history  profitability  and expertise in property management  and a debt service coverage ratio of at least is typically required 
at december   the average commercial real estate loan had a principal balance of million and the portfolio had an average loan to value ratio of 
at the prior year end  the respective measures were million and 
the origination of commercial real estate loans generally requires a security interest in the personal property and or an assignment of the rents and or leases 
construction loans the construction loan portfolio totaled billion at december   representing of total loans outstanding and a million  or  increase from the year end amount 
in addition to loans acquired in the atlantic bank transaction  which totaled million at the date of acquisition  the increase reflects organic loan production 
originations totaled million in the current twelve month period  a million increase from the prior year amount 
the increase in construction loans reflects the relationships we have developed with several of the leading developers and builders in our region  or that were developed by our merger partners prior to their joining the company 
at december   of our construction loans were for construction and development on long island  with the five boroughs of new york city accounting for  combined 
residential subdivision loans are typically originated for terms of to months  with a prime based floating rate of interest 
such loans have had a strong credit history  with no losses recorded for more than a decade 
they also generate origination fees that are amortized over the life of the loan and are recorded as interest income 
we also originate loans for the construction of owner occupied one to four family homes under contract and  to a lesser extent  for the acquisition and development of commercial real estate and multi family properties 
these loans are also comparatively short term in nature  ranging up to three years for one to four family home construction and up to two years for the development of commercial and multi family properties 
such loans feature a daily floating prime based index and have a minimum floor 
because construction loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk than loans on multi family buildings  borrowers are required to provide a personal guarantee during construction and evidence of a permanent loan commitment being in place 
the risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value upon completion of construction  as compared to the estimated cost of construction  including interest  and upon the estimated time to sell or lease such properties 
if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  or the length of time to sell or lease it is greater than anticipated  the property could have a value upon completion that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the loan 
when applicable  it is our practice to require that residential properties be pre sold or that borrowers secure permanent financing commitments from a recognized lender for an amount equal to  or greater than  the amount of our loan 
in some cases  we ourselves may provide permanent financing 

table of contents one to four family loans we originate one to four family loans on a pass through basis only 
applications are taken and processed by a third party conduit  and the loans are sold to the conduit or its affiliates  without recourse  servicing released  shortly after they close 
in connection with this practice  we have entered into a private label program for the origination of one to four family and home equity loans under a mortgage origination assistance agreement with a nationally recognized third party mortgage originator the conduit  based on defined underwriting criteria that we have approved 
under this program  dedicated loan representatives are available to meet with our customers in any of our branches or  if they prefer  at their home or office 
the loans are marketed through our branch network and our community bank web site  and are intended to serve our existing customers and attract new ones  as well 
we fund the loans directly and  under a separate loan and servicing rights purchase and sale agreement with the conduit  have the option of retaining the loans for portfolio  selling the loans to a third party investor  or delivering the loans to the conduit at an agreed upon price 
the conduit pays us a fee at the time a loan is delivered  which exceeds the fee we pay to the conduit for processing the loan 
the fee income produced by each transaction is recorded as other non interest income 
in  we originated one to four family and home equity loans totaling million  all of which were subsequently sold to the conduit 
in the prior year  the total of one to four family and home equity loans originated and sold in this way totaled million 
at december   our one to four family loan portfolio totaled million  representing a million  or  decline from the year earlier amount 
while the atlantic bank transaction added million of one to four family loans to our portfolio at the time of the acquisition  the increase was offset by the level of repayments and the impact of our conduit policy 
our portfolio of one to four family loans thus consists of seasoned loans that were acquired in our various merger transactions or were originated before the adoption of the conduit policy 
in addition to ensuring that our customers are provided with an extensive range of one to four family products  the conduit arrangement supports two of our primary objectives reducing our exposure to interest rate and credit risk  and promoting our efficiency 
while the pending acquisition of pennfed is expected to provide us with a one to four family loan portfolio of approximately billion  it is currently our intention to sell or securitize the majority of acquired one to four family loans 
the proceeds are expected to be utilized to grow our portfolio of higher yielding credits and or to reduce our higher cost funding sources  depending on market conditions at the time 
other loans while mortgage loans represent the vast majority of our loans outstanding  we also offer a variety of other loans 
other loans rose million  or  year over year to million  primarily reflecting the atlantic bank transaction  which added million of other loans to our portfolio at the acquisition date 
c i loans accounted for million  or  of the loans acquired in the atlantic bank transaction and for million  or  of the other loan balance at december  while c i loans totaled million at december   representing of loans outstanding  the year end amount represented of total loans 
included in the year end balance of c i loans are loans originated by standard funding corp 
standard funding  which was acquired in the atlantic bank transaction and provides insurance premium financing to businesses and professionals for commercial lines of coverage 
ranked among the top ten premium insurance financers in the nation  standard funding accounted for million of outstanding c i loans at december  with the acquisition of atlantic bank  we enhanced our ability to provide a variety of commercial loan products  including term loans  demand loans  revolving lines of credit  letters of credit  equipment leasing  and 
table of contents loans that are partly guaranteed by the small business administration 
a broad range of commercial loans  both collateralized and uncollateralized  are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and receivables  business expansion  and for the purchase of machinery and equipment 
the purpose of the loan is considered in determining its term and structure  the pricing is tied to the prime rate of interest 
the remainder of the portfolio of other loans consists of home equity loans and lines of credit  as well as a variety of consumer loans  most of which were originated by our merger partners prior to their joining the company 
lending authority the loans we originate are subject to federal and state laws and regulations  and are underwritten in accordance with loan underwriting policies and procedures approved by the mortgage and real estate committee of the board of directors of the community bank the mortgage committee  the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank the credit committee  and the respective boards of directors as a whole 
in addition to the loans that we ourselves have originated  the portfolio consists of loans acquired in our merger transactions 
we generally do not purchase whole mortgage loans 
in accordance with the banks policies  all loans of million or more must be reported to the board of directors 
in  of such loans were originated by the banks  with an aggregate loan balance of billion at origination 
in  of such loans were originated by the community bank  with an aggregate loan balance at origination of billion 
we also place a limit on the amount of loans that may be made to one borrower 
at december   the largest concentration of loans to one borrower consisted of a financing package provided by the community bank to riverbay corporation co op city  a residential community with  units in the bronx  new york  which was created under new york state s mitchell lama housing program in the late s to provide affordable housing for middle income residents of the state 
at the time of origination  september   the financing consisted of a multi family loan in the amount of million and a construction loan of the same amount 
at december   million of the construction loan had been advanced  bringing the outstanding loan amount to million  representing the largest loan in our portfolio at year end the multi family loan was originated for a term of years  with a rate of interest of in years one through five  in years six through ten  in years through  and a floor of in years through the construction loan features a floating rate of interest equal to basis points above prime 
on each anniversary of the original loan  the funds advanced under the construction component during the prior twelve month period are to be combined with the multi family loan 
accordingly  million of construction loan advances were combined with the multi family loan at december  the multi family loan thus amounted to million and the construction loan amounted to million outstanding at year end 
construction advances are made as various stages of construction are completed  as certified by a consulting engineer engaged by the community bank 
the combined credit of million is within the community bank s loans to one borrower limitation  and both components of the financing package were performing in accordance with their terms at december  
table of contents loan maturity and repricing the following table sets forth the maturity or period to repricing of our loan portfolio at december  loans that have adjustable rates are shown as being due in the period during which the interest rates are next subject to change 
the table does not include prepayments or scheduled principal amortization 
prepayments and scheduled principal amortization totaled billion in mortgage and other loans at december  in thousands multi family commercial real estate construction one to four family other total loans amount due within one year after one year one to five years over five years total due or repricing after one year total amounts due or repricing  gross the following table sets forth  as of december   the dollar amount of all loans due after december   and indicates whether such loans have fixed or adjustable rates of interest 
due after december  in thousands fixed adjustable total mortgage loans multi family commercial real estate construction family total mortgage loans other loans total loans outstanding loan commitments at december   we had outstanding loan commitments of billion  including commitments to originate million of multi family loans  million of commercial real estate loans  million of construction loans  million of one to four family loans  and million of other loans 
in addition to our commitments to originate loans  we had commitments to issue financial stand by  performance  and commercial letters of credit of million  million  and million  featuring terms ranging from one to three years 
financial stand by letters of credit obligate us to guarantee payment of a specific financial obligation on behalf of certain borrowers  while performance stand by letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under certain non financial contractual obligations 
commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer 
although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions  the majority are used to settle payments in international trade 
typically  such letters of credit require presentation of documents which describe the commercial transaction  evidence shipment  and transfer title 
the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
please see contractual obligations and off balance sheet commitments later in this report for a further discussion of financial stand by  performance  and commercial letters of credit 

table of contents the volume of loans produced in will depend on several factors  including the level and direction of market interest rates and their impact on refinancing activity  the availability and cost of funds  competition from other banks and non financial institutions for loans and deposits  and the level of loan demand 
asset quality in  we extended our strong record of asset quality  with non performing assets declining million  or  from the year end balance to million at december  the latter balance was equivalent to of total assets  and represented an improvement from at the prior year end 
the improvement in asset quality was driven by a reduction in non performing loans to million  representing of total loans at december  at the prior year end  non performing loans totaled million and represented of total loans 
included in non performing loans at december  were non accrual mortgage loans of million and non accrual other loans of million 
a loan generally is classified as a non accrual loan when it is days past due and management has determined that the collectibility of the entire loan is doubtful 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  we cease the accrual of interest owed  and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income 
a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is less than days past due and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible 
non performing loans are reviewed regularly by management and reported on a monthly basis to the mortgage committee  the credit committee  and the boards of directors of the banks 
when necessary  non performing loans are written down to their current appraised values  less certain transaction costs 
outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to borrowers who are delinquent in paying their loans 
properties that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as other real estate owned  and recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance or fair value at the date of acquisition  less the estimated cost of selling the property at that time 
at december   other real estate owned consisted of five properties totaling million  signifying a  increase from the prior year end total  which consisted of four properties 
it is our policy to require an appraisal of such properties shortly before foreclosure and to re appraise the properties on an as needed basis until they are sold 
we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible  given current market conditions and the condition of the property 
we are currently in the process of marketing the properties acquired by foreclosure at prices that exceed their respective carrying values  and therefore do not expect to incur a loss of principal when such properties are sold 
other real estate owned is generally titled in the name of a wholly owned bank subsidiary 
while the levels of non performing assets and loans declined over the course of the year  the level of net charge offs rose from  in to  representing of average loans in in both years  our charge offs consisted entirely of consumer and unsecured loans that had been acquired in merger transactions 
while the quality of the loan portfolio is partly due to the relative strength of our local economy and real estate market  it also is indicative of the strength of our credit standards and the consistency with which we have adhered to these standards while growing our loan portfolio 
in the case of multi family and commercial real estate loans  we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated to determine the property s economic value  and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan 
the amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values  with the economic value being the value more typically used 
the condition of the collateral property is another critical factor 
multi family buildings and commercial real estate properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval by executive management and the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
in addition  a member of the mortgage committee participates in inspections on multi family loans in excess of million that are originated by the community bank 
similarly  a member of the mortgage or credit committee participates in inspections on commercial real estate loans in excess of million 
furthermore  independent appraisers  whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in house appraisal officers  perform appraisals on multi family buildings and commercial real estate properties 

table of contents in addition  we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and have an established track record with our lending officers over the course of ten or more years 
to further minimize credit risk  our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower and typically require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 
although we typically will lend up to of the appraised value on multi family buildings and up to on commercial properties  the average loan to value ratio of such credits at december  was considerably lower  amounting to and  respectively 
exceptions to these loan to value limitations may be made on a case by case basis  and require the approval of the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
the quality of the construction loan portfolio also reflects board involvement  with a member of the pertinent committee participating in inspections on loans exceeding million  and construction loans requiring the approval of the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
the loans in this portfolio have been stringently underwritten  and are primarily made to well established builders who have worked with us or our merger partners in the past 
we typically will lend up to of the estimated market value  and up to in the case of home construction loans to individuals 
with respect to commercial construction loans  which are not our primary focus  we typically will lend up to of the estimated market value of the property 
credit risk is also reduced through the loan disbursement process 
loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses  and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and or consulting engineers 
c i loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrower s business  and are generally collateralized by various business assets  including inventory  equipment  accounts receivable  and other assets 
as a result  the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful 
furthermore  the collateral underlying the loans may depreciate over time  may not be conducive to appraisal  and may fluctuate in value  based upon the business results 
accordingly  personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for c i loans 
our loan portfolio has been deliberately structured to reduce our exposure to both credit and interest rate risk 
the vast majority of the loans in our portfolio are intermediate term credits  with multi family and commercial real estate loans typically repaying or refinancing within three to five years of origination  and the duration of construction loans ranging up to months  with to months more the norm 
all three types of mortgage loans have had a solid performance record  with no losses on principal recorded for more than years in the case of our multi family credits and more than ten years in the case of our commercial real estate and residential subdivision construction loans 
furthermore  our multi family loans are largely secured by rent regulated buildings  which tend to maintain a high level of occupancy  even in a weak economy 
historically  our portfolios of multi family  commercial real estate  and construction loans have outperformed our one to four family credits  accordingly  we have been originating one to four family loans on a pass through basis  selling them to a third party conduit shortly after closing  without recourse 
the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are consistent across all categories  with a late charge being assessed after fifteen days of delinquency and a notice mailed the same day 
we then attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment 
when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property  we attempt to obtain full payment  and will also work out a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action 
while we strive to originate loans that will perform fully  the absence of delinquencies or losses cannot be guaranteed 
the ability of a borrower to fulfill his or her obligations may be impacted by various factors  including a change in personal circumstances  a downturn in local real estate values  or a decline in the economy 
to minimize the impact of credit risk  we maintain coverage through an allowance for loan losses which may be increased through the provision for loan losses charged to operations  or reduced through charge offs or reversals 

table of contents at december   our consolidated allowance for loan losses totaled million  as compared to million at december  the year over year increase reflects the addition of million as a result of the atlantic bank transaction  which exceeded the  of charge offs recorded over the course of the year 
at december  and  our consolidated allowance for loan losses represented and  respectively  of total loans and and  respectively  of non performing loans 
the manner in which the allowance for loan losses is established  and the assumptions made in that process  are considered critical to our financial condition and results 
such assumptions are based on judgments that are difficult  complex  and subjective regarding various matters of inherent uncertainty 
accordingly  the policies that govern our assessment of the allowance for loan losses are considered critical accounting policies and are discussed under that heading earlier in this report 
the following table presents information regarding the consolidated allowance for loan losses and non performing assets at each year end in the five years ended december  asset quality analysis at december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of year allowance acquired in merger transactions charge offs balance at end of year non performing assets non accrual mortgage loans other non accrual loans loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets ratios non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to non performing loans allowance for loan losses to total loans we had no troubled debt restructurings  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings  at any of the dates presented in the preceding table 
based upon all relevant and presently available information  management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate

table of contents the preceding allocation is based upon an estimate of various factors  as discussed in critical accounting policies earlier in this report 
a different allocation methodology may be deemed to be more appropriate in the future 
securities at december   securities totaled billion and represented of total assets  as compared to billion  representing of total assets  at december  the million  or  decline was indicative of our strategy of utilizing the cash flows from securities sales and repayments to fund our loan production and or to reduce our balance of higher cost sources of funds 
during  we sold securities totaling billion  primarily consisting of securities that were acquired in the atlantic bank transaction and  to a lesser extent  securities that were acquired in the long island financial transaction at the end of in  cash flows from securities totaled billion  including repayments of million and the proceeds from the aforementioned sales 
the investment policies of the company and the banks are established by the respective boards of directors and implemented by their respective investment committees  in concert with the respective asset and liability management committees 
the investment committees generally meet quarterly or on an as needed basis to review the portfolios and specific capital market transactions 
in addition  the securities portfolios are reviewed monthly by the boards of directors as a whole 
furthermore  the policies guiding the company s and the banks investments are reviewed at least annually by the respective investment committees  as well as by the respective boards 
while the policies permit investment in various types of liquid assets  neither the company nor the banks currently maintain a trading portfolio 
the investment policies of the company and the banks permit investments in mortgage related securities  ie  securities issued and backed by fannie mae fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  and ginnie mae gnma and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and other securities  consisting of us government agency obligations  municipal bonds  corporate debt obligations  capital trust notes  and corporate equities 
depending on management s intent at the time of purchase  securities are classified as available for sale or as held to maturity 
while available for sale securities are intended to generate earnings  they also represent a significant source of cash flows and liquidity for future loan production  the reduction of higher cost funding  and general operating activities 
held to maturity securities also serve as a source of earnings and generate cash flows  although they are less liquid than available for sale securities 
available for sale securities represented billion  or  of total securities at december   and were down million  or  from the year earlier amount 
mortgage related securities accounted for billion and billion  respectively  of the year end and totals  while other securities represented the remaining million and million  respectively 
the after tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale equaled million at december   as compared to million at december  these amounts were recorded as a component of stockholders equity at the respective year ends 
held to maturity securities declined million  or  year over year  to billion  and represented of total securities at december  mortgage related securities accounted for billion and billion of the year end and totals  while other securities accounted for billion and billion  respectively 
included in each of the latter amounts were us government agency obligations of billion  the remainder of the respective balances consisted  respectively  of capital trust notes and corporate bonds 
at december   the estimated weighted average life of the available for sale securities portfolio was years  the estimated weighted average life of the held to maturity securities portfolio was years at that date 
the mortgage related securities in the two portfolios  combined  had an estimated weighted average life of years and a market value of approximately billion 

table of contents with the pending acquisition of pennfed  we expect to acquire a securities portfolio of approximately million 
consistent with our practice of repositioning our balance sheet upon completion of a merger transaction  and depending upon market conditions  we currently anticipate selling a portion of pennfed s securities and utilizing the cash flows to produce higher yielding assets and or to reduce our higher cost sources of funds 
other investments bank owned life insurance boli at december   the company had a million investment in boli  as compared to million at december  the increase reflects million of boli acquired in the atlantic bank acquisition  in addition to an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies 
the boli policies were purchased to mitigate the effect of future employee benefit costs 
boli is reported at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the consolidated statements of condition  and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value is included in non interest income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income
