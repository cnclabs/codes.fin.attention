when evaluating the financial condition and operating performance of the company  management focuses on the following financial and non financial indicators growth of number of subscribers of the company s newsletters and page views of the homepages of the travelzoo web sites  operating margin  growth in revenues in the absolute and relative to the growth in reach of the company s publications  and revenue per employee as a measure of productivity 
critical accounting policies we believe that there are a number of accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  and liabilities to former stockholders 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on arrangements in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
if fixed fee advertising is displayed over a term greater than one month  revenues are recognized ratably over the period as described below 
the majority of insertion orders have terms that begin and end in a quarterly reporting period 
in the cases where at the end of a quarterly reporting period the term of an insertion order is not complete  the company recognizes revenue for the period by pro rating the total arrangement fee to revenue and deferred revenue based on a measure of proportionate performance of its obligation under the insertion order 
the company measures proportionate performance by the number of placements delivered and undelivered as of the reporting date 
the company uses prices stated on its internal rate card for measuring the value of delivered and undelivered placements 
fees for variable fee advertising arrangements are recognized based on the number of impressions displayed or clicks delivered during the period 
under these policies  no revenue is recognized unless persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is deemed reasonably assured 
the company evaluates each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider an insertion order signed by the client or its agency to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery 
delivery is considered to occur when the advertising has been displayed and  if applicable  the click throughs have been delivered 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and payment terms are standard 
collection is deemed reasonably assured 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the client 
collection is deemed reasonably assured if we expect that the client will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  then we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue 
table of contents upon cash collection 
collection is deemed not reasonably assured when a client is perceived to be in financial distress  which may be evidenced by weak industry conditions  a bankruptcy filing  or previously billed amounts that are past due 
revenues from advertising sold to clients through agencies are reported at the net amount billed to the agency 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience of write offs and a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the creditworthiness of the client  the economic conditions of the client s industry  and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could impact the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
liability to former stockholders on october   we announced a program under which we would make cash payments to people who establish that they were former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  and who failed to submit requests to convert shares into travelzoo inc within the required time period 
we account for the cost of this program as an expense recorded in general and administrative expenses and a current accrued liability 
the ultimate total cost of this program is not reliably estimable because it is based on the ultimate number of valid requests received and future levels of the company s common stock price 
the company s common stock price affects the liability because the amount of cash payments under the program is based in part on the recent level of the stock price at the date valid requests are received 
we do not know how many of the requests for shares originally received by travelzoo 
com corporation in were valid 
we believe that only a portion of such requests were valid 
in order to receive payment under the program  a person is required to establish that such person validly held shares in travelzoo 
com corporation 
since the total cost of the program is not reliably estimable  the amount of expense recorded in a period is equal to the number of actual claims received during the period multiplied by i the number of shares held by each individual former stockholder and ii the applicable settlement price based on the recent price of our common stock at the date the claim is received as stipulated by the program 
requests are generally paid within days of receipt 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further details about our liabilities to former stockholders 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenues  the results of our operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest income income before income taxes income taxes net income for the year ended december   we reported income from operations of approximately million 
as of december   we had retained earnings of approximately million 
our operating margin increased to for the year ended december  from in the main reason for this increase in operating margin is that our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue did not increase at the same rate as our revenues due primarily to a decrease in marketing expenses as a result of a lower cost of acquiring new subscribers and fewer new subscribers acquired see subscriber acquisition below 
another reason for this increase in our operating margin is that our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue did not increase at the same rate as our revenues due primarily to a decrease in the number of requests received related to a program in which the company intends to make cash payments to people who establish that they were former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  and who failed to submit requests to convert shares into travelzoo inc within the required time period 
we do not know whether our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will continue to decrease in future periods 
increased competition in our industry may require us to increase advertising for our brand and for our products 
increases in the average cost of acquiring new subscribers see subscriber acquisition below may result in an increase of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue 
we may decide to accelerate our subscriber acquisition for various strategic and tactical reasons and  as a result  increase our marketing expenses 
we may see a unique opportunity for a brand marketing campaign that will result in an increase of marketing expenses 
further  our strategy to replicate our business model in selected foreign markets see growth strategy below may result in a significant increase in our sales and marketing expenses and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we expect fluctuations of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue from quarter to quarter 
some of the fluctuations may be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations 
we do not know what our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in future periods 
there may be fluctuations that have a material impact on our results of operations 
we expect our headcount to continue to increase in the future 
the company s headcount is one of the main drivers of general and administrative expenses 
therefore  we expect our absolute general and administrative expenses to continue to increase 
in addition  we expect that we will incur significant expenses in in order to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal controls over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
at this time  the total cost is not reliably estimable as it will be dependent on the number of areas requiring improvement and the extent of any required remediation efforts 
table of contents as well as growth of our international operations 
we expect our planned expansion into foreign markets to result in a significant additional increase in our general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may also fluctuate depending on the number of requests received related to a program under which the company intends to make cash payments to people who establish that they were former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  and who failed to submit requests to convert shares into travelzoo inc within the required time period 
reach the following table sets forth the number of subscribers of each of our e mail publications in both north america and europe as of december  and and the total number of page views for the homepages of the travelzoo web sites in north america for the years ended december  and and the number of page views for the homepage of the travelzoo web sites in europe for the year ended december  and the period from november  to december  management considers page views for the travelzoo homepages as indicators for the growth of web site traffic 
management reviews these non financial metrics for two reasons first  to monitor our progress in increasing the reach of our products 
second  to evaluate whether we are able to convert higher reach into higher revenues 
year ended december  year over year growth subscribers north america travelzoo top newsflash europe travelzoo top newsflash page views of homepages of travelzoo web sites north america europe   n a for the year ended december   the data only includes information from november to december  no information available for period before november  the comparability of year over year changes of page views of the homepages of travelzoo web sites may be limited due to the design and navigation of the web sites 
additionally  we believe that the increased use of security software has adversely affected the tracking of page views 
the company s revenues for north america for the year ended december  increased by from the previous year 
the number of subscribers of the travelzoo top e mail newsletter increased by for north america and page views of the homepages of the travelzoo north america web sites increased by 
management believes that the data for the years ended december  and shows that the company was able to generate higher revenues as reach increased 
revenues our total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this represents an increase of 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this represented an increase of of our revenue growth in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  came from our operations in europe 
the remaining came from our operations in north america ie travelzoo web sites  travelzoo top newsletter  newsflash and supersearch and is attributed to an increase in our advertising rates for our existing products and an increase in the number of clients and the volume of advertising 
table of contents sold 
approximately of our revenue growth in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is attributed to an increase in our advertising rates in north america for our existing products 
due to the increase in the reach of our publications  we increased the prices for advertising placements in our publications on average by approximately as of january  approximately of our revenue growth in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is attributed to an increase in the number of clients in north america and an increase in the volume of advertising sold to existing clients in north america 
approximately of our revenue growth in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  came from our new product  supersearch 
approximately of our revenue growth came from our operations in europe 
the remaining of our revenue growth came from our other products ie travelzoo web sites  travelzoo top newsletter  and newsflash and is attributed to an increase in our advertising rates for our existing products and an increase in the number of clients and the volume of advertising sold 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  two clients accounted for and of our total revenues in the year ended december  in the year ended december   two clients accounted for and of our total revenues 
in the year ended december   one client accounted for of our total revenues 
no other clients accounted for or more of our total revenues during the years ended december    or the agreements with these clients are in the form of multiple insertion orders from groups of entities under common control 
management expects revenue concentration to remain at the current level in the foreseeable future because there is a high concentration in the online travel agency industry 
management believes that our ability to increase revenues in the future depends mainly on three factors our ability to increase our advertising rates  our ability to sell more advertising to existing clients  and our ability to increase the number of clients 
we believe that we can increase our advertising rates only if the reach of our publications increases 
we do not know if we will be able to increase the reach of our publications 
we believe that we can sell more advertising only if the market for online advertising continues to grow and if we can maintain or increase our market share 
we believe that the market for online advertising continues to grow 
we do not know if we will be able to maintain or increase our market share 
we have historically increased the number of clients in each year since inception 
we do not know if we will be able to increase the number of clients in the future 
over the last three years we increased advertising rates as of january of each year 
we intend to increase advertising rates once a year as of january however  there is no assurance that there will be increases of advertising rates 
depending on the level of competition in the industry and the condition of the online advertising market  we may decide not to increase our advertising rates 
average revenue per employee increased to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of network expenses  including fees we pay for co location services  depreciation of network equipment  and salary expenses associated with network operations staff 
our cost of revenues increased to million for the year ended december  and to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenues was for the year ended december   down from for the years ended december  and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  decreased compared to the year ended december  because we did not need to increase our network operations staff significantly  and we did not have significant increases in fees for co location services to support the increase in revenues 

table of contents operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotional expenses  salary expenses associated with sales and marketing staff  expenses related to our participation in industry conferences  and public relations expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased to million and to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  was primarily due to a million increase in salary expense and a  increase in expenses related to our participation in industry conferences  public relations and the introduction of video content on our web site 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase of million in our advertising campaigns and a million increase in salary expense 
the goal of our advertising campaigns was to acquire new subscribers for our e mail products  promote supersearch and increase brand awareness for travelzoo 
for the years ended december    and  advertising expenses accounted for   and respectively  of sales and marketing expenses 
advertising activities during these three year periods consisted primarily of online advertising 
our goal is to increase our revenues from advertising sales 
one important factor that drives our revenues are our advertising rates 
we believe that we can increase our advertising rates only if the reach of our publications increases 
in order to increase the reach of our publications  we have to acquire a significant number of new subscribers in every quarter and continue to promote our brand 
the main factor that impacts our advertising expenses is the average cost per acquisition of a new subscriber 
we believe that the average cost per acquisition depends mainly on the advertising rates which we pay for media buys  our ability to manage our subscriber acquisition efforts successfully  and the degree of competition in our industry 
in may  we began operations in the uk in february  we began operations in germany 
in april  we began operations in canada 
in july  we opened a sales office in spain 
the start up of our business in europe and canada and our plan to expand into other countries in is expected to result in a significant increase in our sales and marketing expenses in the foreseeable future 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for administrative and executive staff  fees for professional services  rent  bad debt expense  payments made to former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  amortization of intangible assets and general office expense 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  and to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  in  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase of  in office expenses and a  increase in salary expense as headcount grew and with the expansion to foreign markets and a  increase in legal and professional service expenses 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in expenses related to a program under which the company makes cash payments to people who establish that they were former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  and who failed to submit requests to convert their shares into travelzoo inc within the required time period 
in  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to expenses of million for sox compliance and also due to an increase of  in expenses for office space as headcount grew and with expansion to foreign markets 
we expect our headcount to continue to increase in the future 
the company s headcount is one of the main drivers of general and administrative expenses 
therefore  we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase 
our strategy to replicate our business model in foreign markets could result in a significant additional increase in our general and administrative expenses 
the company recorded expenses of  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  related to a program under which we make cash payments to people who establish that they were former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  and who failed to submit requests to convert shares into travelzoo inc within the required time period 
the expenses are based on the number of actual 
table of contents valid requests received and the company s stock price 
the company expects expenses related to the program to decrease in future periods due to the expected decrease in the number of actual valid requests received 
subscriber acquisition the table set forth below provides for each quarter in   and  an analysis of our average cost for acquisition of new subscribers for our travelzoo top newsletter and our newsflash e mail alert service for our operating segments  north america and europe 
the table includes the following data average cost per acquisition of a new subscriber this is the quarterly costs of consumer marketing programs whose purpose was primarily to acquire new subscribers  divided by total new subscribers added during the quarter 
new subscribers total new subscribers who signed up for at least one of our e mail publications throughout the quarter 
this is an unduplicated subscriber number  meaning a subscriber who signed up for two or more of our publications is only counted once 
unsubscribes subscribers who were removed from our list throughout the quarter either as a result of their requesting removal  or based on periodic list maintenance after we determined that the e mail address was likely no longer valid 
balance this is the number of subscribers at the end of the quarter  computed by taking the previous quarter s subscriber balance  adding new subscribers during the current quarter  and subtracting unsubscribes during the current quarter 
north america average cost per acquisition of a new period subscriber new subscribers unsubscribes balance q q q q q q q q q q q q europe average cost per acquisition of a new period subscriber new subscribers unsubscribes balance q q q q q q 
table of contents in north america  we have noted a general trend of increasing cost per new subscriber over the last few years  driven by a gradual increase in online advertising rates by our media suppliers as well as increased activity from competitors using similar forms of online advertising for their own marketing efforts 
the decline in new subscriber acquisition costs for north america in q reflects the effect of new advertising campaigns which were tested at that time 
the decline in new subscriber acquisition costs in north america in q was impacted by a credit received from a vendor in the amount of  we do not consider these declines in new subscriber costs to be indicative of a longer term trend or to indicate that our subscriber costs are likely to stay at this level or are likely to decline further 
increasing average cost per subscriber is likely to result in higher absolute marketing expenses and potentially higher relative marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue 
going forward we expect continued upward pressure on online advertising rates and continued activity from competitors  which will likely increase our cost per new subscriber over the long term 
the effect on operations is that greater absolute and relative marketing expenditure is necessary to continue to grow the reach of our publications 
however  it is possible that the factors driving subscriber acquisition cost increases can be partially or completely offset by new or improved methods of subscriber acquisition using techniques which are under evaluation

net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  was million 
net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  was million

the tax benefit of stock options resulted from exercises during of stock options by directors 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from higher revenues during and greater days of sales outstanding relating to a higher mix of variable fee advertising  which has a longer collection period than fixed fee advertising because it is billed in arrears while fixed fee advertising is billed in advance

the net cash provided in the year ended december  was due primarily to the proceeds from issuance of common stock in a private placement transaction and upon exercises of stock options by directors 
our capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including market acceptance of our products and services  the amount of our resources we devote to development of new products  cash payments to former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  expansion of our operations  and the amount of our resources we devote to promoting awareness of the travelzoo brand 
since the inception of the program under which we would make cash payments to people who establish that they were former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  and who failed to submit requests to convert shares into travelzoo inc within the required time period  we have incurred expenses of million 
while future payments for this program are expected to decrease  the total cost of this program is still undeterminable because it is dependent on our stock price and on the number of requests ultimately received 
consistent with our growth  we have experienced a substantial increase in our sales and marketing expenses since inception  and we anticipate that these increases will continue for the foreseeable future 
we believe cash on hand and generated during those periods will be sufficient to pay such costs 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate possible investments in businesses  products and technologies  the consummation of any of which would increase our capital requirements 
although we currently believe that we have sufficient capital resources to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements beyond the next months  unanticipated events and opportunities may require us to sell additional equity or debt securities or establish new credit facilities to raise capital in order to meet our capital requirements 
if we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities  the sale could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 
if we issue debt securities or establish a new credit facility  our fixed obligations could increase  and we may be required to agree to operating covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot be sure that any such financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
we expect that cash on hand will be sufficient to finance the expansion of our european operations 

table of contents the following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december  in thousands thereafter total operating leases purchase obligations total commitments as of december   we have recorded a liability of  for the estimated minimum liability that is probable to be paid under a program to make cash payments to former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation based on claims received as of december  the total liability incurred under this program is not reliably estimable because it is based on the ultimate number of valid requests received and future levels of the company s common stock price 
the company s common stock price affects the liability because the amount of cash payments under the program is based in part on the recent level of the stock price at the date valid requests are received 
growth strategy our growth strategy has two main elements replicate our business model in selected foreign markets in europe and the asia pacific region  and expand the scope of our business model 
in march  we announced the opening of an office in paris and our expansion into france 
we intend to create a third business segment  asia pacific  and begin operations in the asia pacific region  including australia  greater china china  hong kong  taiwan  india  japan  and south korea  in and in  we intend to list show ticket offers on our travelzoo web sites 
further  we intend to launch travelzoo network  a network of affiliate web sites that list travel deals published by travelzoo 
we do not know what impact this growth strategy will have on our results of operations because we cannot reliably estimate expenses and revenues 
it is possible that the increase in expenses will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our potential exposure to changes in market interest rates is not material 
the company has no outstanding debt and is not a party to any derivatives transactions 
we invest in highly liquid investments with short maturities 
accordingly  we do not expect any material loss from these investments 
our european operations expose us to foreign currency risk associated with agreements being denominated in british sterling pounds and euros

we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with fluctuations of the british sterling pound as the financial position and operating results of our european subsidiary will be translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with fluctuations of the canadian dollar as the financial position and operating results of our canadian subsidiary will be translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge these exposures
