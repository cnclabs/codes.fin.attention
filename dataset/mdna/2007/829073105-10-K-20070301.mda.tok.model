oem relationships 
the company works closely with manufacturers of engineered wood products and oems in developing and expanding the application and sales of simpson strong tie s engineered wood connector and fastener products and simpson dura vent s gas  wood and pellet stove venting products 
sst has relationships with several of the largest manufacturers of engineered wood products  and sdv has oem relationships with major fireplace and stove manufacturers 
while the company is expanding its established facilities outside of california to increase its presence and sales in these markets  sales of some products may relate primarily to certain regions 
for example  sales of sst s line of shearwalls  which the company expanded with the introduction of a steel wall  are concentrated in the western region of the united states since their use is primarily intended to resist the effects of seismic forces 
since  the company has established operations in the united kingdom  opened warehouse and distribution facilities in western canada and the midwestern and northeastern united states  purchased anchor products manufacturers in illinois and eastern canada and connector product manufacturers in france  denmark  germany and western canada and acquired the assets of a leading manufacturer and distributor of screw fastening systems and collated screws with manufacturing and distribution operations in tennessee and distribution in canada  europe  australia and new zealand 
the european investments are intended to establish a presence in the european community through companies with existing customer bases and through servicing us based customers operating there 
the company recently established a sales office in hong kong 
the company also distributes connector and epoxy products in chile  mexico  japan  australia and new zealand 
the company intends to continue to pursue and expand operations both inside and outside of the united states see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
a company goal is to manufacture and warehouse its products in geographic proximity to its markets to provide availability and rapid delivery of products to customers and prompt response to customer requests for specially designed products and services 
with respect to the diy and dealer markets  the company s strategy is to keep the customer s retail stores continuously stocked with adequate supplies of the full line of the company s products that those stores carry 
the company manages its inventory to help assure continuous product availability 
most customer orders are filled within a few days 
high levels of manufacturing automation and flexibility allow the company to maintain its quality standards while continuing to provide prompt delivery 
the company s product research and development is based largely on needs that customers communicate to the company 
the company typically has developed to new products annually some of which may be produced in a range of sizes 
the company s strategy is to develop new products on a proprietary basis  to patent them when appropriate and to seek trade secret protection for others 
the company s long term strategy is to develop  acquire or invest in product lines or businesses that a complement the company s existing product lines  b can be marketed through its existing distribution channels  c might benefit from use of the simpson strong tie and simpson dura vent brand names and expertise  d are responsive to needs of the company s customers and e expand its markets geographically 
simpson strong tie overview connectors produced by simpson strong tie typically are steel devices that are used to strengthen  support and connect joints in residential and commercial construction and diy projects 
these products enhance the safety and durability of the structures in which they are installed and can save time and labor costs for the contractor 
sst s connector products increase structural integrity and improve structural resistance to seismic  wind and other forces 
applications range from building framing to deck construction to diy projects 
sst produces and markets over  standard and custom products 
in the united states  connector usage developed faster in the west than elsewhere due to the low cost and abundance of timber and to local construction practices 
increasingly  the market has been influenced both by a growing awareness that the devastation caused by seismic  wind and other disasters can be reduced through improved building codes and construction practices and by environmental concerns that contribute to the increasing cost and reduced availability of wood 
most simpson strong tie products are listed by recognized building standards agencies as complying with model building codes and are specified by architects and engineers for use in projects they are designing or supervising 
the engineered wood products industry continues to develop in response to concerns about the availability of wood  and the company believes that sst is the leading supplier of connectors for use with engineered wood products 
metal connectors  anchors and fasteners will corrode and lose load carrying capacity when installed in corrosive environments or exposed to corrosive materials 
there are many environments and materials that may cause corrosion  including ocean salt air  fire retardants  preservative treated wood  dissimilar metals  fumes and fertilizers 
the variables present in a single building environment make it impossible accurately to predict if  or when  significant corrosion will begin or reach a critical level 
this relative uncertainty makes it crucial that the specifiers be knowledgeable of the potential risks and select a product coating or metal that is suitable for the intended use 
changes in the preservative treated wood industry have created additional concerns 
effective december   the preservative treated wood industry voluntarily transitioned from chromated copper arsenate cca c used in residential applications to alternative treatments 
testing has shown that certain alternative replacement treatments are generally more corrosive than cca c 
sst publishes technical bulletins on subjects such as this and others that affect the installation and use of its products and makes its technical bulletins available on its website at www

most of sst s products are produced with a high level of automation  using progressive dies run in automatic presses making parts from coiled sheet steel at rates that often exceed strokes per minute 
sst estimates that it produces over billion product pieces per year 
most of sst s products skus are bar coded with upc numbers for easy identification  and nearly all of the products sold to home centers are labeled with bar codes 
sst has significant press capacity and has multiple dies for some of its high volume products because of the need to produce these products close to the customer and to provide backup capacity 
the balance of production is accomplished through a combination of manual  blanking and numerically controlled nc processes that include robotic welders  lasers and turret punches 
this capability allows sst to produce products with little redesign or set up time  facilitating rapid turnaround for customers 
new tooling is also highly automated 
dies are designed and produced using computer aided design cad and computer aided machining cam systems 
cad cam capability enables sst to create multiple dies quickly and design them to high standards 
the company is constantly reviewing its product line to reduce manufacturing costs  increase automation  and take advantage of new types of materials 
for example  sst has introduced multiple products made from an engineered composite plastic  the anchormate  the strapmate and the anchor bolt stabilizer 
simpson strong tie also manufactures chemical anchoring products at its facility in addison  illinois 
the chemicals are mixed in batches and are then loaded in two part dispensers 
these dispensers mix the product on the job site since set up times are usually very short 
in addition  sst purchases a number of products  primarily fasteners  powder actuated tools and accessories and certain of its mechanical anchoring products  from various sources around the world 
these purchased products undergo inspections on a sample basis for conformance with ordered specifications and tolerances before being distributed

upc bar coding and computer tracking systems provide sdv s industrial engineers and production supervisors with real time productivity tools to measure and evaluate current production rates  methods and equipment 
regulation simpson strong tie s product lines are subject to federal  state  county  municipal and other governmental and quasi governmental regulations that affect product design  development  testing  applications  marketing  sales  installation and use 
most sst products are recognized by building code and standards agencies 
agencies that recognize company products include the international code council evaluation service icc es  the city of los angeles  the state of florida  the state of wisconsin  and the california division of the state architect 
these and other agencies adopt various testing and design standards and incorporate them into their related building codes 
with the adoption of the international residential code and the international building code  these standards are being applied more uniformly  and these codes are recognized throughout most of the united states 
sst considers code recognition to be a significant marketing tool and devotes considerable effort to obtaining and maintaining appropriate approvals for its products 
sst believes that architects  engineers  contractors and other customers are less likely to purchase structural products that lack the appropriate code acceptance if code accepted competitive products are available 
sst actively participates in industry related professional associations to keep abreast of regulatory changes and to provide information to regulatory agencies 
simpson dura vent operates under a regulatory environment that includes appliance and venting performance standards related to safety  energy efficiency and air quality 
gas venting regulations are contained in the national fuel gas code nfgc  while safety and performance regulations for wood burning appliances and chimney systems are contained in a national fire protection association standard nfpa 
standards for testing gas vents and chimneys are developed by testing laboratories such as underwriter s laboratories ul in compliance with the american national standards institute 
the environmental protection agency epa regulates clean air standards for both gas and wood burning appliances 
the department of energy doe regulates energy efficiency standards under the authority of the national appliance energy conservation act 
under this act  the doe periodically reviews the necessity for increased efficiency standards with respect to gas furnaces and gas water heaters 
a substantial percentage of sdv s type b gas vent sales are for gas furnaces and gas water heaters 
minimum appliance efficiency standards have been enacted that could negatively affect sales of type b gas vents  which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
in turn  the various building codes could be adopted by local municipalities  resulting in enforcement through the building permit process 
safety  air quality and energy efficiency requirements are enforced by local air quality districts and municipalities by requiring proper ul  epa and doe labels on appliances and venting systems 
competition the company faces a variety of competition in all of the markets in which it participates 
this competition ranges from subsidiaries of large national or international corporations to small regional manufacturers 
while price is an important factor  the company competes on the basis of quality  breadth of product line  technical support  availability of inventory  service including custom design and manufacturing  field support and product innovation 
as a result of differences in structural design and building practices and codes  simpson strong tie s markets tend to differ by region 
within these regions  sst competes with companies of varying size  several of which also distribute their products nationally 
the venting industry is highly competitive 
sdv s competitors include a variety of manufacturers that have operations in the united states  canada and mexico 
most of its competitors do not compete in all of sdv s product lines  and some have additional product lines which sdv does not offer 
sdv competes on the basis of quality  service  breadth of product line  availability of inventory  technical support  and product innovation 
raw materials the principal raw material used by the company is steel  including stainless steel  which is used by simpson strong tie and simpson dura vent  and is generally ordered to specific american society of testing and materials astm standards 
sst also uses materials such as epoxies and acrylics in the manufacture of its chemical anchoring products 
sdv also uses raw materials such as aluminum  aluminum alloys and ceramic and other insulation materials  and both sst and sdv use cartons 
the company purchases raw materials from a variety of commercial sources 
the company s practice is to seek cost savings and enhanced quality by purchasing from a limited number of suppliers 
the steel industry is highly cyclical and prices for the company s raw materials are influenced by numerous factors beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions  competition  labor costs  import duties  raw material shortages and other trade restrictions 
steel prices rose sharply in  declined during the first half of  and quickly increased in the fourth quarter of  in response to raw material shortages and increased demand from hurricane katrina 
steel prices continued to increase into the third quarter of due to numerous factors  steel prices may increase in the future 
in addition to increases in steel prices  the mills also added surcharges for zinc  energy and freight in response to increases in their costs 
all of these and other factors could adversely affect the company s cost and availability of steel in the company might not be able to increase its product prices to correspond to increases in raw materials prices without materially and adversely affecting its sales and profits 
see item a risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company historically has not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials 
patents and proprietary rights the company s subsidiaries have us and foreign patents  the majority of which cover products that they currently manufacture and market 
these patents  and applications for new patents  cover various design aspects of the subsidiaries products  as well as processes used in their manufacture 
the company s subsidiaries are continuing to develop new potentially patentable products  product enhancements and product designs 
although the company s subsidiaries do not intend to apply for additional foreign patents covering existing products  the company has developed an international patent program to protect new products that its subsidiaries may develop 
in addition to seeking patent protection  the company relies on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain its competitive position

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risks before you decide to buy or hold shares of our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition would likely suffer 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our stock 
this and other public reports may contain forward looking statements based on current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those forward looking statements as a result of many factors  as more fully described below and elsewhere in our public reports 
we do not undertake to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
failure to comply with industry regulations could result in reduced sales and increased costs 
the design  capacity and quality of most of our products and manufacturing processes are subject to numerous and extensive regulations and standards promulgated by governmental  quasi governmental and industry organizations 
these regulations and standards are highly technical  complex and subject to frequent revision 
if our products or manufacturing processes fail to comply with any regulations or standards  we may not be able to manufacture and market our products profitably 
failure to comply with regulations and standards could therefore materially reduce our sales and increase our costs 
if we fail to compete effectively  our revenue and profit margins could decline 
we face a variety of competition in all of the markets in which we participate 
many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  other technologies may be the bases for competitive products that could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
other companies may find our markets attractive and enter those markets 
competitive pricing  including price competition or the introduction of new products  could have material adverse effects on our revenues and profit margins 
our ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on the specification or approval of our products by architects  engineers  building inspectors  building code officials and customers 
if a significant segment of those communities were to decide that the design  materials  manufacturing  testing or quality control of our products is inferior to that of any of our competitors  our sales and profits would be materially reduced 
if we lose all or part of a large customer  our sales and profits would decline 
we have substantial sales to a few large customers 
loss of all or part of our sales to a large customer would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 
our largest customer accounted for of net sales for the years ended december  and this customer may endeavor to replace  in some or all markets  our products with lower priced products supplied by others or may otherwise reduce its purchases of our products 
we also might reduce our dependence on our largest customer by reducing or terminating sales to one or more of the customer s subsidiaries 
any reduction in  or termination of  our sales to this customer would at least temporarily  and possibly longer  cause a material reduction in our net sales  income from operations and net income 
a reduction in or elimination of our sales to our largest customer  or another of our larger customers  would increase our relative dependence on our remaining large customers 
in addition  our customers include retailers and distributors 
retail and distribution businesses have consolidated over time  which could increase the material adverse effect of losing any of them 
increases in prices of raw materials could negatively affect our sales and profits 
our principal raw material is steel  including stainless steel 
the steel industry is highly cyclical 
numerous factors beyond our control  such as general economic conditions  competition  worldwide demand  labor costs  energy costs  and import duties and other trade restrictions  influence prices for our raw materials 
in march  for example  the united states imposed tariffs on several types of imported steel  which increased our cost of steel 
in addition  consolidation among domestic integrated steel producers  changes in supply and demand in steel markets  the weakening united states dollar and other events have led to increased steel costs 
the domestic steel market is heavily influenced by three major united states manufacturers 
worldwide demand for steel is strong 
we have not always been able  and in the future we might not be able  to increase our product prices in amounts that correspond to increases in costs of raw materials  without materially and adversely affecting our sales and profits 
we have not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials 
if we cannot protect our technology  we will not be able to compete effectively 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology  in part through patents 
we might not be able to protect or rely on our patents 
patents might not issue pursuant to pending patent applications 
others might independently develop the same or similar technology  develop around the patented aspects of any of our products or proposed products  or otherwise obtain access to or circumvent our proprietary technology 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain our competitive position 
we might not be able to protect our know how or other proprietary information 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our significant products  our sales and profits could be materially reduced 
in attempting to protect our proprietary information  we sometimes initiate lawsuits against competitors and others that we believe have infringed or are infringing our rights 
in such an event  the defendant may assert counterclaims to complicate or delay the litigation  or for other reasons 
litigation may be very costly and may result in adverse judgments that affect our sales and profits materially and adversely 
integrating acquired businesses may divert management s attention away from our day to day operations 
in the future  we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  for example difficulties assimilating the operations and products of acquired businesses  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  overvaluation of acquired businesses  undisclosed existing or potential liabilities of acquired businesses  acceptance of acquired businesses products by our customers  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  litigation involving activities  properties or products of acquired businesses  consumer and other claims related to products of acquired businesses  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses 
the integration of our acquired operations  products and personnel may place a significant burden on management and our internal resources 
the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm our business 
in addition  future acquisitions may cause us to issue additional equity securities that dilute the value of our existing equity securities  increase our debt  and cause impairment and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
any acquisition could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
significant costs to integrate our acquired operations may negatively affect our financial condition and the market price of our stock 
we will incur costs from integrating acquired business operations  products and personnel 
these costs may be significant and may include expenses and other liabilities for employee redeployment  relocation or severance  combining teams and processes in various functional areas  reorganization or closures of facilities  and relocation or disposition of excess equipment 
the integration costs that we incur may negatively affect our profitability and the market price of our stock 
our future growth may depend on our ability to penetrate new domestic and international markets  which could reduce our profitability 
international construction customs  standards  techniques and methods differ from those in the united states 
laws and regulations applicable in new markets may be unfamiliar to us 
compliance may be substantially more costly than we anticipate 
as a result  we may need to redesign products  or invent or design new products  to compete effectively and profitably in new markets 
we expect that we will need significant time  which may be years  to generate substantial sales or profits in new markets 
other significant challenges to conducting business in foreign countries include  among other factors  local acceptance of our products  political instability  currency controls  changes in import and export regulations  changes in tariff and freight rates  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we might not be able to penetrate these markets and any market penetration that occurs might not be timely or profitable 
if we do not penetrate these markets within a reasonable time  we will be unable to recoup part or all of the significant investments we will have made in attempting to do so 
seasons and business cycles affect our operating results 
our sales are seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
with some exceptions  our sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of the year  as customers purchase construction materials in the late spring and summer months for the construction season 
in addition  weather conditions  such as unseasonably warm  cold or wet weather  which affect  and sometimes delay or accelerate  installation of some of our products  significantly affect our results of operations 
political and economic events can also affect our revenues 
we have little control over the timing of customer purchases 
sales that we anticipate in one quarter may occur in another quarter  affecting both quarters results 
in addition  we incur significant expenses as we develop  produce and market our products in anticipation of future orders 
we maintain high inventory levels and typically ship orders as we receive them  so we operate with little backlog 
as a result  net sales in any quarter generally depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is fixed 
planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
when sales do not meet our expectations  our operating results will be reduced for the relevant quarters  as we will have already incurred expenses based on those expectations 
our principal markets are in the building construction industry 
that industry is subject to significant volatility due to real estate market cycles  fluctuations in interest rates  the availability of credit to builders and developers  inflation rates  weather  and other factors and trends 
none of these factors or trends is within our control 
declines in commercial and residential construction  such as housing starts  can be expected to reduce the demand for our products 
future negative economic or construction industry performance could adversely affect our business 
declines in construction activity or demand for our products could materially and adversely affect our sales and profitability 
product liability claims and product recalls could harm our reputation  sales and financial condition 
we design and manufacture most of our standard products and expect to continue to do so  although we buy raw materials and some manufactured products from others 
we have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in the manufacturing  design or testing of our products 
we also have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in raw materials and finished goods produced by others 
some flaws and deficiencies have not been apparent until after the products were installed by customers 
many of our products are integral to the structural soundness or safety of the structures in which they are used 
if any flaws or deficiencies exist in our products and if such flaws or deficiencies are not discovered and corrected before our products are incorporated into structures  the structures could be unsafe or could suffer severe damage  such as collapse or fire  and personal injury could result 
errors in the installation of our products  even if the products are free of flaws and deficiencies  could also cause personal injury and unsafe structural conditions 
to the extent that such damage or injury is not covered by our product liability insurance and we are held to be liable  we could be required to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury  and our reputation  business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
even if a flaw or deficiency is discovered before any damage or injury occurs  we may need to recall products  and we may be liable for any costs necessary to replace recalled products or retrofit the affected structures 
any such recall or retrofit could entail substantial costs and adversely affect our reputation  sales and financial condition 
we do not carry insurance against recall costs or the adverse business effect of a recall  and our product liability insurance may not cover retrofit costs 
claims resulting from a natural disaster might be made against us with regard to damage or destruction of structures incorporating our products 
any such claims  if asserted  could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
complying or failing to comply with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations could affect us materially and adversely 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions into the air  discharges into water  and generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
we are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters 
our manufacturing operations involve the use of solvents  chemicals  oils and other materials that are regarded as hazardous or toxic 
we also use complex and heavy machinery and equipment that can pose severe safety hazards  especially if not properly and carefully used 
some of our products also incorporate materials that are hazardous or toxic in some forms  such as zinc and lead used in some steel galvanizing processes and chemicals used in our acrylic and epoxy anchoring products 
the gun powder used in our powder actuated tools is explosive 
misuse of other materials in some of our products could also cause injury or sickness 
if we do not obtain all material licenses and permits required by environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  we may be subject to regulatory action by governmental authorities 
if our policies and procedures do not comply in all respects with existing environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  our activities might violate such laws and regulations 
even if our policies and procedures do comply  but our employees fail or neglect to follow them in all respects  we might incur similar liability 
relevant laws and regulations could change or new ones could be adopted that require us to obtain additional licenses and permits and cause us to incur substantial expense 
our generation  handling  use  storage  transportation  treatment or disposal of hazardous or toxic materials  machinery and equipment might cause injury to persons or to the environment 
we may need to take remedial action if properties that we occupy are contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances 
any change in laws or regulations  any legal or regulatory violations  or any contamination  could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
new appliance efficiency standards could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the department of energy regulates energy efficiency under the authority of the national appliance energy conservation act 
under this act  the department of energy periodically reviews the need for increased efficiency standards with respect to gas furnaces and gas water heaters 
a substantial percentage of our type b gas vent sales are for gas furnaces and gas water heaters 
the department of energy might adopt minimum appliance efficiency standards that negatively affect sales of type b gas vents  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we depend on key management and technical personnel  the loss of whom could harm our business 
we depend on certain key management and technical personnel  including  among others  thomas j fitzmyers  michael j 
herbert  phillip terry kingsfather  barclay simpson and stephen p 
eberhard 
the loss of one or more key employees could materially and adversely affect us 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical  marketing and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of our activities 
we face strong competition for such personnel 
we might not be able to attract or retain such personnel 
any work stoppage or interruption by employees could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
a significant number of our employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that will expire in and a work stoppage or interruption by a significant number of our employees could have a material and adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
international operations expose us to foreign exchange rate risk 
we have foreign exchange rate risk in our international operations and through purchases from foreign vendors 
we do not currently hedge this risk 
changes in currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales and profitability 
natural disasters could decrease our manufacturing capacity 
most of our current and planned manufacturing facilities are located in geographic regions that have experienced major natural disasters  such as earthquakes  floods and hurricanes 
for example  the loma prieta earthquake in northern california destroyed a freeway and caused other major damage within a few miles of our facilities in san leandro  california 
the earthquakes in northridge  california  in january  destroyed several freeways and numerous buildings in the region in which our facilities in brea are located 
our disaster recovery plan may not be adequate or effective 
we do not carry earthquake insurance 
other insurance that we carry is limited in the risks covered and the amount of coverage 
our insurance would not be adequate to cover all of our resulting costs  business interruption and lost profits when a major natural disaster occurs 
a natural disaster rendering one or more of our manufacturing facilities totally or partially unusable  whether or not covered by insurance  would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
control by our principal stockholders will prevent other stockholders from influencing management 
barclay simpson  the chairman of our board of directors  controls approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
thomas j fitzmyers  our president and chief executive officer  owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
messrs 
simpson and fitzmyers have substantial influence with respect to the election of our directors and are also expected to continue to exercise substantial control over some fundamental changes affecting us  such as a merger or sale of assets or amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 
any issuance of preferred stock may dilute your investment and reduce funds available for dividends 
our board of directors is authorized by our certificate of incorporation to determine the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and to authorize the issuance of shares of any such series on such terms as our board of directors may approve 
any such issuance could be used to impede an acquisition of our business that our board of directors does not approve  further dilute the equity investments of holders of our common stock and reduce funds available for the payment of dividends to holders of our common stock 
our stock price is likely to be volatile and could drop 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to period to period variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the construction and construction materials industries  relatively low trading volume in our common stock and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market is subject to extreme price fluctuations 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
securities market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of  other than million shares held as of february  by our affiliates  as that term is defined in rule under the securities act of options to purchase million shares of our common stock were outstanding as of december   including options to purchase million shares that were exercisable 
if a substantial number of shares were sold in the public market pursuant to rule or on exercise of options  the trading price of our common stock in the public market could be adversely affected 
delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain anti takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
section of the delaware general corporation law may make the acquisition of simpson manufacturing co  inc and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult by prohibiting stockholders holding or more of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring simpson manufacturing co  inc without the consent of our board of directors for at least three years from the date they first hold or more of the voting stock 
barclay simpson and his affiliates are not subject to this provision of delaware law with respect to their investment in simpson manufacturing co  inc in addition  our stockholder rights plan has significant anti takeover effects by causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
we are subject to a number of significant risks that might cause our actual results to vary materially from our plans  targets or projections  including lack of market acceptance of new products  failing to develop new products with significant market potential  increased labor costs  including significant increases in worker s compensation insurance premiums and health care benefits  failing to continue to increase net revenues and operating income  failing to anticipate  appropriately invest in and effectively manage the human  information technology and logistical resources necessary to support the growth of our business  including managing the costs associated with such resources  failing to integrate  leverage and generate expected rates of return on investments  including expansion of existing businesses and expansion through acquisitions  failing to generate sufficient future positive operating cash flows and  if necessary  secure adequate external financing to fund our growth  and interruptions in service by common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels 
if we change significantly the nature or extent of some of our manufacturing operations  we may reduce our net income 
if we decide to change significantly the nature or extent of a portion of our manufacturing operations  we may need to record an impairment of our goodwill and correspondingly reduce our net income 
we had million of goodwill at december  failure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions  providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the consolidated financial statements  providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization  and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
because of its inherent limitations  our internal control over financial reporting might not detect or prevent misstatement of our consolidated financial statements 
our growth and entry into new  globally dispersed markets puts significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 
failure of our accounting systems could harm our business and financial results 
we are currently implementing a new commercially available microsoft third party accounting software system  initially focused on replacing our internally developed general ledger and purchasing and payables systems 
we have been testing the new general ledger system and plan to begin using the new systems in any errors or defects in  or unavailability of  third party software or our implementation of the systems  could result in errors in our financial statements  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to implement the new accounting software systems  we would be required to write off the value of capitalized software costs and correspondingly reduce our income 
the amount capitalized at december   was million 
if we continue to use our internally developed accounting systems and they are not able to accommodate our future business needs  or if we find that they or any new systems we may implement contain errors or defects  our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

this document contains forward looking statements  based on numerous assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
although the company believes that the forward looking statements are reasonable  it does not and cannot give any assurance that its beliefs and expectations will prove to be correct 
many factors could significantly affect the company s operations and cause the company s actual results to be substantially different from the company s expectations 
see item a risk factors 
actual results might differ materially from results suggested by any forward looking statements in this report 
the company does not have an obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of the receipt of new information  the occurrence of future events or otherwise 
the following is a discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the company for the years ended december   and  and of certain factors that may affect the company s prospective financial condition and results of operations 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein 
overview the company s net sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales resulted primarily from increased geographic distribution and a broadening of the company s customer base and product lines  both internally and through acquisitions 
net sales increased in from in all regions of the united states  with above average rates of growth in the western  other than california  and the southeastern portions of the country  although net sales decreased in the third and fourth quarters of compared to the same quarters of in recent years  home centers have been one of the company s fastest growing distribution channels 
in this channel  the company s largest customer  the home depot  exceeded of the company s consolidated net sales in each of the last three years see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  item business simpson strong tie sales and marketing and item a risk factors 
expansion into international markets also contributed to the net sales growth over the last three years 
sales outside of the us have increased significantly  due in large part to the acquisition of bmf bygningsbeslag a s bmf in january and to the acquisition of mga construction hardware steel fabricating limited and mga connectors limited collectively  mga in may gross profit margin decreased to in from in primarily due to increased material cost  mainly steel  though gross margins in improved as compared to results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development and other engineering selling expense general and administrative expense loss gain on sale of assets income from operations interest income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income in november  the company completed a for stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend of its common stock 
all of the share and per share numbers have been adjusted to reflect this stock split 
in february  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of the company s common stock 
the authorization will remain in effect through the end of this replaces the million repurchase authorization from december in february  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for million 
during  the company purchased  shares of its common stock for million under the authorization 
there were no repurchases made by the company during during  the company purchased  shares of its common stock for million under the authorization 
comparison of the years ended december  and net sales in  net sales increased to million as compared to net sales of million in net sales of simpson strong tie s products increased to million in from million in  while net sales of simpson dura vent s products decreased to million in from million in sdv accounted for of the company s total net sales in  a decrease from in the increase in net sales at sst resulted from an increase in average prices of  offset by a decrease in sales volume 
the decrease in net sales at sdv resulted from a decrease in sales volume  offset by a increase in average prices 
although the company s net sales increased for the year  net sales in the third and fourth quarters of decreased compared to the same quarters of the majority of the company s sales growth in the united states occurred only in the southeast and sales were flat elsewhere  with the exception of california  where sales decreased 
sales in canada and continental europe were strong and sales in the united kingdom were up only marginally 
sales to homecenters and dealer and contractor distributors in total were flat in sales were mixed across simpson strong tie s major product lines 
simpson strong tie s quik drive and anchor systems product lines both had increases in sales while sales of products used primarily in new home construction  including the strong wall product line  decreased 
sales of simpson dura vent s pellet vent and chimney product lines both increased in while sales of its gas vent and direct vent products in decreased when compared to gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in from in this increase was primarily due to lower manufacturing costs partially offset by higher fixed overhead costs as a percentage of sales as a result of the lower sales volume in the second half of the year 
the company continues to face uncertainty in the cost and availability of steel 
several factors are contributing to this uncertainty 
high raw material and energy prices have led the company to believe that steel prices are likely to remain at increased levels in the near term 
in addition  major domestic integrated steel producers have consolidated over the last several years 
to mitigate the effect of the rising steel prices and to avoid possible shortages in supply  the company increased its purchasing efforts in the second half of in addition  the company had sales price increases in  to offset the rising cost of steel 
if steel prices increase and the company is not able to maintain its prices or increase them sufficiently  the company s margins could deteriorate 
research and development and other engineering research and development and other engineering expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to additional staff  incentive pay  other personnel costs and product testing  totaling million

cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition  as follows raw materials and purchased finished goods principally valued at cost determined on a weighted average basis 
 in process products and finished goods cost of direct materials and labor plus attributable overhead based on a normal level of activity

 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter for the company and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of the company s weighted average cost of capital
