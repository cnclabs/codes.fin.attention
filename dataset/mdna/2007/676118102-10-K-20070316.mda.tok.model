while we continue to sell numismatic coins to independent coin dealers  there has been a significant shift beginning in the second quarter to our direct marketing sales efforts 
in  we sold through three independent dealers of which two represented of total sales 
direct sales efforts inbound and outbound call center and related infrastructure were outsourced beginning in the second quarter to an experienced direct marketing partner 
the decrease of million in is primarily due to a lower availability of high value numismatic gold coins  sales to fewer independent coin dealers and a shift to a higher volume of lower priced silver coins 
the majority of our coin sales in were silver coins sold through our direct marketing partner 
we have been extremely pleased with the marketing programs and sales efforts of our direct marketing partner where our focus is selling our silver coin inventory directly to consumers at higher unit prices than we were receiving through our indirect wholesale channels 
another benefit of this outsourcing is a significant reduction of our overhead costs associated with our direct sales organization 
we are testing a variety of advertising methods and media that are beginning to show great promise 
we intend to increase our investment in the advertising programs that are demonstrating positive sales results 
in  we sold a higher volume of total coins  but they represented a greater mix of lower unit price silver coins sold through our direct marketing partner 
as of december   we have a remaining inventory of approximately graded and un graded gold coins and  silver coins 
of our remaining gold coin inventory  the majority of which are eagles which are not as much in demand by numismatic collectors as the higher value numismatic double eagles 
we anticipate the eagle gold coin inventory to be sold over time to non numismatic collectors through our direct marketing partner

table of contents operations and research expenses were million in  compared to million in of the million increase in  million was due to our vessel operations primarily associated with the purchase of our search and inspection vessel in june the remaining 
million increase in expenses pertains to our themed attraction segment as the closing of our attraction in new orleans in september and subsequent lease termination caused an acceleration of the estimated useful lives of certain assets and leasehold improvements 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in of the 
million decrease  million related to reduced sales and marketing expenses primarily due to the closing of our direct sales company operated call center in may these expenses were offset by increased share based compensation costs associated with our annual incentive plan and adoption of fasb r in other income or expense other income and expense generally consists of interest income on investments offset by interest expense on our revolving credit facility and equipment loans 
for  
million of other income was recorded due to business interruption insurance proceeds received for our themed attraction in new orleans related to hurricane katrina 
income taxes we did not record any provision benefit for income taxes in or due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets resulting from operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a full valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax assets as of december  compared to million as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on the available evidence  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would not be realizable without the recovery of high value shipwrecks such as the hms sussex and thus a valuation allowance has been recorded as of december  we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in our ability to generate net income in future periods is dependent upon the success of our ability to recover and monetize high value shipwrecks 
we continue to be confident that we have several potential high value shipwreck targets which could be recovered in our current estimates do not include monetizing any assets for shipwrecks which may be recovered in or beyond 
we will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period

potential proceeds from the exercise of the march and may warrants would be million and million  respectively 
material trends and uncertainties the results of operations for the immediate two preceding fiscal years produced net operating losses 
we anticipate we will continue to incur net losses in our ability to generate net income in future periods is dependent upon the success of our ability to recover and monetize high value shipwrecks 
we believe we have several potential high value shipwreck targets which could be recovered in our current business plan estimates our cash requirements for operations and capital expenditures will range from million to million 
based upon our million year end cash position  recent equity offering and projected revenues  we estimate an additional cash requirement of million to million to meet our projected business plan requirements 
in may  we have a potential exercise of warrants for million 
however  if the warrants expire  we will be required to raise additional financing to fund our projected business plan 
while we have been successful in raising the necessary funds in the past  there can be no assurance we can continue to do so 
we also cannot guarantee that the sales of our products and other available cash sources will generate sufficient cash flow to meet our projected cash requirements in if cash flow is not sufficient to meet our projected business plan requirements  we will be required to reduce our exploration and development efforts and overhead to a level for which funding can be secured 
compared to dollars in millions vs revenue cost of sales operations research marketing  general  administrative total cost and expenses revenue revenues are generated primarily through the sale of gold and silver coins  but also include other artifacts and merchandise 
revenues for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively  representing sales volume of approximately  gold and silver coins in and approximately  gold and silver coins in in sales were made through independent coin dealers at wholesale prices as well as through our direct retail sales telemarketing area 
in  sales were made only through independent coin dealers 
revenues were significantly lower in versus due to a number of factors 
we continued to sell numismatic coins to independent coin dealers 
during the latter half of  we experienced a decrease in numismatic gold coin revenue  relative to  due to a lower availability of our highest value gold coins  a desire to maximize total revenue from coin inventory  and sales to fewer independent coin dealers 
the number of independent dealers dropped from thirteen in to six in of which two dealers represented percent of our total sales 
our experience has shown that many of these independent dealers are primarily interested in the higher quality numismatic coin market 
as our availability of these higher quality coins diminishes  we expected the number of independent dealers interested in our coins to be reduced 
in addition  the sale of silver half dollars to our independent coin dealer wholesale channel was significantly reduced from levels  as their main interest has been in the numismatic gold coins 
we continue to develop additional indirect sales channels to supplement our coin dealer network for our non graded gold  shipwreck effect silver coins and for other merchandise 
we continued to develop and plan to increase retail distribution of coins and other merchandise through direct sales channels 
however  during our first year of direct sales in  sales volumes were lower than originally expected 
while we have been developing a strong client base with a promising percentage of repeat sales  it has taken longer than expected to generate the numbers of leads and customers necessary to reach our goals 

table of contents cost and expenses cost of sales consists of shipwreck recovery costs  grading  conservation  packaging  and shipping costs associated with artifact  merchandise and book sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for and was percent and percent  respectively 
the major factors that contribute to cost of sales as a percentage of revenue include capitalized ship recovery costs  number of artifacts recovered  revenue per artifact sold and the cost of merchandise and books 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue will change depending on the sales mix because of the significantly higher unit sales prices for gold than silver coins and other merchandise
