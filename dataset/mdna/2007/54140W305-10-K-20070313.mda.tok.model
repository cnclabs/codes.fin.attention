item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview general we are a test and yield learning company in the semiconductor design for manufacturing  or dfm  sector 
our proprietary technologies for embedded test and diagnostics enable the more efficient test of complex semiconductor devices 
our technology allows semiconductor designers to insert test structures inside semiconductor integrated circuits 
these test structures allow designers and engineers to test the functionality and performance of their devices throughout each key stage of a complex semiconductor s life cycle 
the most complex of these circuits are called system on a chip  or soc  semiconductors 
our embedded test solution has been successfully deployed in soc s found in digital consumer products  medical products  networking and wireless communications devices  computers and satellite systems 
our solution also allows testing of integrated circuits after they have been assembled onto boards and systems  enabling diagnostic test throughout the semiconductor s life cycle 
our analysis software aggregates and analyzes data from various semiconductor fabrication and test sources to identify whether silicon behavior meets design criteria across varying manufacturing and operating conditions 
our embedded test products generate proprietary circuit structures that are incorporated into an integrated circuit to test and diagnose the chip at full speed  without the signal delay or degradation experienced by external testers 
our proprietary circuits are designed to be modular and reusable  to enable more efficient design and to address time to market and manufacturing yield issues 
we believe our products can reduce semiconductor manufacturing and test costs  accelerate silicon bring up times  provide for yield learning  improve time to yield and result in less field returns 
the target market for our technology is soc designs with feature widths of nanometers  nanometers  nanometers and smaller 
a nanometer is one billionth of a meter 
our customers include application specific integrated circuit or system on a chip designers in systems companies  fabless companies and integrated device manufacturers that use our technology in their application specific integrated circuits or systems on a chip as part of systems development and for complex chip development and testing 
we license our intellectual property and software through our direct sales force in the united states and japan  and through our distributors or independent sales representatives in china  europe  korea and taiwan 
we have elected to focus our sales and marketing efforts on larger customers with greater resources 
such large customers generally do not adopt new design methodologies quickly 
also  we may have limited access to the key decision makers of potential customers who can authorize the adoption of our technology 
as a result  the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the sale of our products to that customer  if any  is often lengthy and may include delays associated with our customers budgeting and approval processes  as well as a substantial investment of our time and resources 
we received new orders of million in compared to million in this decrease in new orders was primarily due to the receipt of large multi year orders in from domestic customers 
we expect receipt of new orders to fluctuate due to the lengthy sales cycles and our dependence on large orders 
our backlog  including deferred revenues  of orders which are expected to be recognized as revenue over the months following december   was million at december   compared with million at the end of backlog is comprised of deferred revenues orders which have been billed but for which revenue has not yet been recognized plus written purchase orders which have been accepted but have not yet been billed and for which no revenue has been recognized 
a significant portion of the orders which have been accepted but have not yet been billed provides customers with cancellation rights and customers may also renew contracts before their expiration or modify that portion of their orders which is cancelable 
therefore  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of revenues to be recognized during any succeeding period 
restructuring in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce operating costs by reducing our workforce and consolidating facilities and resources 
accordingly  we recognized a restructuring charge of approximately million for the workforce reduction  facility abandonment expenses  other contractual charges associated with the facilities and other related expenses 
the restructuring plan eliminated employees located in the united states  canada and india  primarily in marketing  engineering and administrative functions 
one facility in canada and the facility in india were eliminated  the restructuring plan was substantially completed by the end of december acquisition in november  we completed the acquisition of siverion  inc for a total purchase price of million 
at the closing we paid million in cash and issued million shares of our common stock valued at million to siverion s stockholders and paid million to certain debt holders 
the purchase price also included a contingent payment of up to million in cash payable on november  the additional cash exchange rights if the average closing price of our common stock for the trading days immediately prior thereto was less than 
on june   the company issued  shares of common stock to certain former stockholders of siverion  inc in exchange for the additional cash exchange rights held by those former stockholders 
in november  we paid an aggregate amount of  to the remaining former siverion  inc stockholders who held additional cash exchange rights in satisfaction of our contingent obligation 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments  income taxes  long term service contracts  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we account for our revenue under the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we derive our revenues from three primary sources license revenues  comprised of fees associated with the licensing of software  service revenues  from maintenance and consulting and training services  and product revenues  from the sale of hardware products 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of such an arrangement  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria are met 
payments received in advance of revenues being recognized are presented as deferred revenue 
license revenues 
we have three license types subscription licenses subscription licenses include software licenses and maintenance for a specific time period  generally three years or less 
maintenance is bundled into the license agreement for the term of the license and is not charged separately 
since vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value does not exist for each element of the arrangement  revenues from subscription licenses are recognized ratably over the license term commencing upon the effective date of the license  if delivery and other revenue recognition criteria are met 
term licenses term licenses include software licenses for a specific time period  generally three to five years 
revenues associated with term licenses are recognized on the effective date of the license  if delivery and other revenue recognition criteria are met 
maintenance agreements for term licenses are sold separately for a specified period and may continue to be renewed for the balance of the license term 
perpetual licenses perpetual licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis 
revenues associated with perpetual licenses are recognized on the effective date of the license  if delivery has occurred and other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we no longer offer this type of license 
the timing of revenue recognition for licenses will differ depending on the license type and on the individual terms and conditions associated with each particular license agreement 
we use vsoe of fair value to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements in those arrangements which contain multiple elements 
if the arrangement includes the future delivery of a specified product or upgrade  all revenues under the arrangement are deferred until the specified product or upgrade has been delivered 
if vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements  we apply the residual method of accounting to the delivered elements 
under the residual method  we defer the vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize revenue on the remaining portion of the arrangement 
vsoe for maintenance is generally based upon the customer s annual renewal rates as set forth in the license agreement 
when vsoe for maintenance cannot be established  we recognize all related revenues ratably over the term of our maintenance obligation 
vsoe for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately 
the timing of revenue recognition for both delivered and undelivered elements is in accordance with the relevant provisions of sop on occasion we offer extended payment terms beyond our normal business practice of between and days to certain customers 
we do not have sufficient experience collecting under these extended payment term arrangements 
as a result  when payment terms are extended  the fee is not considered fixed or determinable and we recognize revenue when the payment is due 
service revenues 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance period 
customers generally renew maintenance agreements for term and perpetual licenses annually 
we allocate a portion of the subscription license revenue to maintenance revenue using the estimated fair value of the maintenance  which is based on maintenance renewals sold separately for similar products 
we generally recognize consulting service revenues as the services are performed or when specified milestones are met 
training revenues are recognized when the training is performed 
product revenues 
our hardware products are generally sold together with a subscription license for software  therefore  we have been unable to establish vsoe for the product when sold separately 
product revenues are generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscription license sold together with the product commencing upon delivery of the product if other revenue recognition criteria are met 
deferred revenue 
deferred revenue consists primarily of unearned license revenues and maintenance and support services under maintenance contracts 
deferred revenue represents the excess of amounts invoiced or received over the revenue recognized 
deferred revenue fluctuates at each period end based on invoice terms and the mix of contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the credit worthiness of our customers in estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of investments we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill impairment our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit 
any impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of long lived intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that we record an impairment charge on finite lived intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets and long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
accounting for stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb for periods beginning in in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
our consolidated financial statements as of december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was  which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases was recognized for the years ended december  or sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations because the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the current period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas  and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards are recognized using the multiple option approach 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in our pro forma information required under sfas for the periods ending prior to january   we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
upon adoption of sfas r  we selected the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model to determine the fair value of share based awards granted beginning in fiscal  the same model which was previously used for our pro forma information required under sfas our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations 
the expected term of the options granted repres ents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding  based on historical information 
the risk free interest rate is based on the u 
s treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term of our equity awards 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore used an expected dividend yield of zero 
for further information on stock based compensation  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made

income taxes our net operating losses are generated domestically  and amounts attributed to our foreign operations have been insignificant for all periods presented 
in and  we recorded an income tax provision of  and  respectively  primarily related to foreign income taxes 
in we recorded income tax benefits of  primarily related to state and foreign taxes 
no benefit for income taxes has been recorded due to the uncertainty of the realization of deferred tax assets 
from inception through december   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes 
as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million available to reduce future federal and california taxable income  respectively 
these federal and california carryforwards will begin to expire in if not utilized 
the extent to which these carryforwards can be used to offset future taxable income may be limited under section of the internal revenue code and applicable state tax law 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents and investments of million and working capital of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in  and million in net cash used in operating activities for was primarily due to a net loss of million  a decrease in deferred revenue million and a decrease in accounts payable million 
this was partly offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of million  and non cash charges relating to depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and stock based compensation totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities for was primarily due to a net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million resulting from the timing of customer billings  a decrease in accrued liabilities of million  primarily from decreases of accrued employee compensation and deferred revenue of million 
this was partly offset by a decrease in other assets of million resulting from amortization of a prepaid license we purchased in  and non cash charges relating to depreciation and amortization of property and equipment of million 
net cash used in operating activities for was primarily due to a net loss of million  an increase in other assets of million resulting from a prepaid license fee for technology incorporated in our lv tm product and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
this was partly offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million resulting from the timing of customer billings  an increase in accrued liabilities of million  primarily due to accrued employee compensation  an increase in deferred revenue of million resulting from customer billings in advance of revenue recognition  and non cash charges relating to depreciation and amortization of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in and million in net cash used in investing activities was million in net cash provided by investing activities for was primarily from proceeds from maturities of investments of million  partly offset by purchases of investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for was primarily from proceeds from maturities of investments of million  partly offset by purchases of investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
net cash used in investing activities for was primarily due to purchases of investments of million  cash payments related to the siverion acquisition of million  and purchases of property and equipment of million 
this was offset by the proceeds from maturities of investments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in net cash used in financing activities was million in and net cash provided by financing activities was million in net cash provided by financing activities for was primarily from the sale in a private placement of million shares of common stock in december net cash used in financing activities for was primarily due to repayment of short term debt of million  partly offset by net proceeds of million received from the employee stock purchase plan purchases and issuance of common stock pursuant to exercise of employee stock options  and proceeds of million borrowed under our line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities for was due to the proceeds from short term debt of million  and proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant employee stock purchase plan purchases and exercise of employee stock options of million 
we have a loan agreement with a bank under which we previously could have borrowed  on a revolving basis  up to million at an interest rate equal to prime rate  which was equal to an annual rate of at december  under the agreement  we must comply with certain operating and reporting covenants and are not permitted to pay dividends  or make material investments or dispositions without the prior written consent of the bank 
if we fail to comply with its covenants under the agreement  the bank can declare any outstanding amounts immediately due and payable and cease advancing money or extending credit to or for us 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december  we were in compliance with the covenants under the loan agreement at that date 
the agreement was amended subsequent to the end of the year and now expires on february  we intend to continue to invest in the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of sales and marketing activities  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the level and timing of license and service revenues  available borrowings under line of credit arrangements and other factors 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions of  or investments in  complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
from time to time  we may be required to raise additional funds through p ublic or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
strategic arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we expect to finance our future commitments using existing cash resources 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating  capital requirements and business acquisitions for at least the next months 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december  our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  primarily under operating lease arrangements for our facilities  were as follows in thousands year ending december  the above amounts include amounts for rent and estimated operating expenses required under the property leases 
indemnification obligations we enter into standard license agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to these agreements  we agree to indemnify our customers for losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of any patent  copyright  or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products 
these indemnification obligations have perpetual terms 
our normal business practice is to limit the maximum amount of indemnification to the amount received from the customer 
on occasion  the maximum amount of indemnification we may be required to make may exceed our normal business practices 
we estimate the fair value of our indemnification obligations as insignificant  based upon our historical experience concerning product and patent infringement claims 
accordingly  we have not recorded any liabilities for indemnification under these agreements as of december  we have agreements whereby our officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have a directors and officers insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of future amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance policy coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers in the private placement of common stock 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement  we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission and agreed to keep it effective for up to two years 
in the event the registration statement becomes unavailable for use for greater than consecutive days or for a total of days or more during any month period in which we are required to keep the registration statement effective  then we must pay to each purchaser in cash of the portion of the purchase price paid by such purchaser for common stock in the private placement  for each day period or pro rata for any portion thereof  up to of the purchase price paid by such purchaser 
warranties we offer our customers a warranty that our products will conform to the documentation provided with the products 
to date  there have been no payments or material costs incurred related to fulfilling these warranty obligations 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these warranties as of december  we assess the need for a warranty reserve on a quarterly basis  and there can be no guarantee that a warranty reserve will not become necessary in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  which allowed a one time election to adopt one of two acceptable methodologies for calculating the initial additional paid in capital apic pool 
in subsequent periods  the apic pool will be increased by tax benefits from stock based compensation and decreased by tax deficiencies caused when the recorded stock based compensation for book purposes exceeds the allowable tax deduction 
we have elected the short cut method to establish the apic pool required under fas r for fiscal year ended december  in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
the standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas must be adopted prospectively as of the beginning of the year it is initially applied 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are still evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
the guidance is applicable for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas creates a fair value option under which an entity may elect to record certain financial assets or liabilities at fair value upon their initial recognition 
subsequent changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
the election of the fair value option would be made on a contract by contract basis and would need to be supported by concurrent documentation or a preexisting documented policy 
sfas requires an entity to separately disclose the fair value of these items on the balance sheet or in the footnotes to the financial statements and to provide information that would allow the financial statement user to understand the imp act on earnings from changes in the fair value 
sfas is effective for us beginning with fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency fluctuations in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk from the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value from our foreign operations 
a significant portion of our revenues has been denominated in us dollars  however  as we increase our direct sales activities in japan  an increasing portion of our revenues may be denominated in the japanese yen 
in addition  the operating expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our financial position and operating results has not been material 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign currency risks 
we intend to assess the use of financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in high quality corporate issuers and in debt instruments of the us government and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only investments with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to rising interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not result in any significant decline in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  investments are classified as available for sale and cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
at december   we had short term us government securities and commercial paper of million
