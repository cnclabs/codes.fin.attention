doral financial purchases mortgage loans from other mortgage bankers in puerto rico consisting primarily of conventional mortgage loans 
for the years ended december  and  total loan purchases amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
in the past  doral financial has also purchased conforming mortgage loans on a wholesale basis from us mainland financial institutions without the related servicing rights 
these loans were generally securitized into fnma or fhlmc securities and sold into the market 
during the third quarter of  doral financial terminated its purchases of whole loans in bulk without the associated servicing rights 
such wholesale purchases of loans from us mainland institutions amounted to billion for new york multi family and commercial real estate lending subsidiary

loan underwriting doral financial s underwriting standards are designed to comply with the relevant guidelines set forth by the department of housing and urban development hud  va  fnma  fhlmc  federal and puerto rico banking regulatory authorities  private mortgage investment conduits and private mortgage insurers  as applicable 
in connection with the changes to doral financial s business strategies  the company s current management determined that doral financial s underwriting procedures and controls were not sufficiently robust or effective to enable the company to fully benefit from the us institutional secondary market for non conforming loans and were not consistent with the company s goals of retaining a greater portion of loan production and improving the quality of its loan portfolio 
accordingly  during  doral financial s current management  with the assistance of outside experts  implemented adjustments to its underwriting processes in order to achieve uniform  automated and rules based underwriting standards 
the implementation of these standards contributed to a significant reduction in the company s loan originations during the second half of the company  however  believes that these changes will allow it to more efficiently underwrite assets with better credit quality and more appropriately price its loan products in the future 
the company s underwriting policies focus primarily on the borrower s ability to pay and secondarily on collateral value 
although the maximum loan to value ratio on conventional mortgages generally does not exceed  the company offers certain loan products with higher loan to value ratios 
the company has not and currently does not generally originate adjustable rate mortgages or negatively amortizing loans 
the company understands that the bulk of its non conforming loan originations have similar credit characteristics to alt a loans in the us mainland mortgage market and are predominantly fixed rate 
the company uses external credit scores as a useful measure for assessing the credit quality of a borrower 
these scores are numbers supplied by credit information providers  based on statistical models that summarize an individual s credit record 
fico scores  developed by fair isaac corporation  are the most commonly used credit scores 
the implementation of the adjustments to the company s underwriting standards described above has resulted in loan originations with higher fico scores 
set forth below is additional information about the fico scores as of the latest available date of all residential loans serviced by the company  together with loan balances as of december  in thousands fico scores residential servicing portfolio percentage of total portfolio not available or below and above total weighted average fico excludes us servicing 
weighted average fico scores do not include loans for which the fico score was not available 

table of contents loan servicing when doral financial sells originated or purchased mortgage loans  it generally retains the right to service such loans and to receive the associated servicing fees 
doral financial s principal source of servicing rights has traditionally been its mortgage loan production 
doral financial also seeks to purchase servicing rights in bulk when it can identify attractive opportunities 
servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans 
failure to service the loans in accordance with contract requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 
in general  doral financial s servicing agreements are terminable by the investors for cause 
however  certain servicing arrangements  such as those with fnma and fhlmc  contain termination provisions that may be triggered by changes in the servicer s financial condition that materially and adversely affect its ability to provide satisfactory servicing of the loans 
approximately and of doral financial s mortgage loan servicing portfolio on behalf of third parties as of december  relates to mortgage servicing for fnma and gnma  respectively 
as of december   doral financial serviced approximately billion in mortgage loans on behalf of third parties 
termination of doral financial s servicing rights by either of these agencies could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s results of operations and financial condition 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with such loans is evaluated based on ancillary income  float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
doral financial s mortgage loan servicing portfolio is subject to reduction by reason of normal amortization  prepayments and foreclosure of outstanding mortgage loans 
additionally  doral financial may sell mortgage loan servicing rights from time to time to other institutions if market conditions are favorable 
for additional information regarding the composition of doral financial s servicing portfolio as of each of the company s last three fiscal year ends  refer to table j mortgage loan servicing in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 
the degree of risk associated with a mortgage loan servicing portfolio is largely dependent on the extent to which the servicing portfolio is non recourse or recourse 
in non recourse servicing  the principal credit risk to the servicer is the cost of temporary advances of funds 
in recourse servicing  the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans  such as fnma or fhlmc  or with a private investor  insurer or guarantor 
losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of such mortgage loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property 
in the past  doral financial often sold non conforming loans on a partial recourse basis 
for additional information regarding recourse obligations  see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  off balance sheet activities in this report

as described below  doral financial utilizes various channels to sell its mortgage products

during the years ended december  and  doral financial issued approximately million and million  respectively  in gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities 
conforming conventional loans are generally either sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or private investors for cash  or are grouped into pools of million or more in aggregate principal balance and exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial sells to broker dealers 
in connection with such exchanges  doral financial pays guarantee fees to fnma and fhlmc 
the issuance of mortgage backed securities provides doral financial with flexibility in selling the mortgage loans that it originates or purchases and also 
table of contents provides income by increasing the value and marketability of such loans 
for the years ended december  and  doral financial securitized approximately million and billion  respectively  of loans into fnma and fhlmc mortgage backed securities 
in addition  for the years ended december  and  doral financial sold approximately million and million  respectively  of loans through the fnma and fhlmc cash window programs 
in the past  the company generally sold mortgage loans that did not conform to gnma  fnma or fhlmc requirements non conforming loans as whole loans to local financial institutions or to fnma or fhlmc and other financial institutions in negotiated transactions 
many of doral financial s whole loan sales to local financial institutions historically were structured similarly to securitization transactions 
when doral financial sold a pool of loans to an investor  it retained the servicing rights and agreed to pay the purchaser a specified pass through rate for the entire pool that was below the weighted average coupon of the underlying mortgage loans 
any amounts received on the mortgages above the pass through rate were retained by doral financial 
the pass through rate paid to the investors was normally a variable rate generally based on a spread over the three month libor 
the present values of the future cash flows retained by doral financial above any contractual servicing fees are recognized on doral financial s financial statements as ios 
since july  doral financial no longer structures its whole loan sales in this manner and has been selling its non conforming loans in the us secondary market for cash without any retained interest  other than the retained mortgage servicing rights 
prior to the fourth quarter of  doral financial s non conforming loan sales were generally made on a limited recourse basis 
pursuant to the restructuring of several recourse transactions consummated during  the company s outstanding principal balance of loans sold subject to recourse decreased by billion  from billion as of december  to billion as of december  as of december  and  doral financial s maximum contractual exposure relating to its portfolio of loans sold with recourse was approximately million and billion  respectively  which included recourse obligations to fnma and fhlmc as of such dates of approximately million and billion  respectively 
as of december  and  doral financial recognized an estimated recourse liability of million and million  respectively  to absorb potential losses from such recourse arrangements 
commencing in the fourth quarter of and continuing throughout  the company has sold non conforming loans to major financial institutions in the us mainland on a non recourse basis  except recourse for certain early defaults 
the company will seek to continue to diversify secondary market outlets for its non conforming loan products both in the us mainland and puerto rico 
see business transformation strategy above for additional information regarding certain changes to the company s business strategy 
in the ordinary course of business  doral financial makes certain representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans  and in certain circumstances  such as in the event of early or first payment default  the company retains credit risk exposure on those loans 
if there is a breach of a representation or warranty or if there is an early payment default  doral financial may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss related to the loan 
recently  certain institutions have approached the company alleging violations of representations and warranties relating to documentation issues primarily loan file deficiencies involving mortgage loans sold to these institutions 
doral financial is working with these financial institutions to review the claims and correct alleged documentation deficiencies

puerto rico secondary mortgage market and favorable tax treatment in general  the puerto rico market for mortgage backed securities is an extension of the us market with respect to pricing  rating of investment instruments  and other matters 
however  doral financial has benefited historically from certain tax incentives provided to puerto rico residents to invest in fha and va loans and gnma securities backed by such loans 
under the puerto rico internal revenue code of the pr code  the interest received on fha and va loans used to finance the original purchase of newly constructed housing in puerto rico and mortgage backed 
table of contents securities backed by such loans is exempt from puerto rico income taxes

doral insurance agency s activities are closely integrated with the company s mortgage loan originations with most policies sold to mortgage customers 
future growth of doral insurance agency s revenues will be tied to the company s level of mortgage originations  its ability to expand the products and services it provides and its ability to cross market its services to doral financial s existing customer base

all other transactions between doral financial or any of its non banking subsidiaries and any of the depository institution subsidiaries  while not subject to quantitative or collateral requirements  are subject to the requirement that they be on terms and conditions no less favorable to the banking subsidiary than would be available to unaffiliated third parties 
under federal reserve policy  a bank holding company such as doral financial is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank 
this support may be required at times when  absent such policy  the bank holding company might not otherwise provide such support 
in addition  any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy  any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 
as a bank holding company  doral financial s right to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors including depositors in the case of depository institution subsidiaries except to the extent that doral financial may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary 
under the federal deposit insurance act the fdia  a depository institution which term includes both commercial banks and savings banks  the deposits of which are insured by the fdic  can be held liable for any loss incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with i the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution  or ii any assistance provided by the fdic to any commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution in danger of default 
default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or a receiver and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 
in some circumstances depending upon the amount of the loss or anticipated loss suffered by the fdic  cross guarantee liability may result in the ultimate failure or insolvency of one or more insured depository institutions in a holding company structure 
any obligation or liability owned by a subsidiary depository institution to its parent company is subordinated to the subsidiary bank s cross guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled insured depository institutions 
financial modernization legislation doral financial has elected to be treated as a financial holding company as permitted by the gramm leach bliley act 
under the gramm leach bliley act  bank holding companies  such as doral financial  all of whose depository institutions are well capitalized and well managed  as defined in the bhc act  and which obtain satisfactory community reinvestment act ratings  may elect to be treated as financial holding companies fhcs 
fhcs are permitted to engage in a broader spectrum of activities than those permitted to other bank holding companies 
fhcs can engage in any activities that are financial in nature  including insurance underwriting and brokerage  and underwriting and dealing in securities without a revenue limit or other limits applicable to foreign securities affiliates which include puerto rico securities affiliates for these purposes 
on october   doral financial was notified by the federal reserve that it no longer satisfies the financial holding company requirements for purposes of the gramm leach bliley act 
in accordance with applicable regulations  doral financial has submitted a plan with the federal reserve on how it intends to satisfy the applicable requirements to remain a financial holding company 
see banking regulatory matters under item legal proceedings  below 
subject to certain limitations  under new merchant banking rules  fhcs are also permitted to make investments in companies that engage in activities that are not financial in nature without regard to the existing limit for domestic investments and limit for overseas including puerto rico investments applicable to bank holding companies that are not fhcs 

table of contents under the gramm leach bliley act  if doral financial fails to meet the requirements for being an fhc and is unable to correct such deficiencies within certain prescribed time periods  the federal reserve could require doral financial to divest control of its depository institution subsidiaries or alternatively to cease conducting activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies that are not fhcs 
the gramm leach bliley act also modified other laws  including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment 
the new financial privacy provisions generally prohibit financial institutions  including doral financial s mortgage banking and banking subsidiaries from disclosing non public personal financial information to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure 
capital adequacy under the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies  the minimum guidelines for the ratio of qualifying total capital total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common equity  retained earnings  minority interests in unconsolidated subsidiaries  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  in the case of a bank holding company  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets discussed below tier capital 
the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt  other preferred stock  certain other instruments and a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves tier capital 
the federal reserve has adopted regulations that require most intangibles  including core deposit intangibles  to be deducted from tier l capital 
the regulations  however  permit the inclusion of a limited amount of intangibles related to readily marketable mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships and include a grandfather provision permitting the continued inclusion of certain existing intangibles 
in addition  the federal reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies 
these guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets discussed below the leverage ratio of for bank holding companies that have the highest regulatory rating or have implemented the federal reserve s market risk capital measure 
all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
the guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing significant internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
furthermore  the guidelines indicate that the federal reserve will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
the tangible tier leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization s tier capital  less all intangibles  to average total assets  less all intangibles 
the us federal bank regulatory agencies risk capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision the bcs 
the bcs is a committee comprised by central bank governors and bank supervisor authorities of the group of ten countries g 
the bcs is in charge of developing broad policy guidelines used by each country s supervisor to determine its own supervisory guidelines 
on june  subsequently amended in november  the bsc released a proposal to replace the capital accord with a new set of guidelines 
the new basel accord  which is often referred to as the basel ii accord  would  among other things  set capital requirements for operational risk and refine the existing capital requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures 
the capital accord does not include a separate capital requirement for operational risk  which is defined under the proposed accord as the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems or from external events 
on september   the us banking regulators delayed the united states implementation of the basel ii accord by one year 
the current unites states implementation timetable consists of parallel calculations under the current regulatory capital regime basel i and the basel ii accord  starting january   and an implementation transition period  starting january  through year end or possibly later 
the us regulators have also reserved the right to change how the basel ii accord is applied in the united states  and retain the existing prompt 
table of contents corrective action and leverage capital requirements applicable to us banking organizations 
see  basel ii capital standards below 
the fdic and the ots have established regulatory capital requirements for state non member insured banks and federal savings banks  such as doral bank pr and doral bank ny  respectively  that are substantially similar to those adopted by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
set forth below are doral financial s  doral bank pr s and doral bank ny s capital ratios at december   based on existing federal reserve  fdic and ots guidelines 
banking subsidiaries well capitalized doral financial doral bank pr doral bank ny minimum total capital ratio total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital ratio tier capital to risk weighted assets leverage ratio tier capital to average assets in the case of doral financial and doral bank pr and tier capital to adjusted total assets in the case of doral bank ny 
as of december   doral bank pr and doral bank ny were in compliance with all the regulatory capital requirements that were applicable to them as a state non member bank and federal savings bank  respectively 
see pat ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  regulatory capital ratios for additional information regarding doral financial s regulatory capital ratios 
both of the company s banking subsidiaries are well capitalized 
however  as a result of the losses incurred during  doral financial s leverage ratio fell below the minimum threshold for the holding company to classify as well capitalized 
under the consent order entered into with the federal reserve  the company filed a capital plan with the federal reserve in which it agreed to maintain a leverage ratio of at least and for doral financial and doral bank  respectively 
as a result of the loss recorded during  doral financial s leverage ratio fell below 
as required by the capital plan  the company is taking steps to increase its leverage ratio 
the loss of well capitalized status may adversely affect the holding company s access to liquidity 
see recent significant events recapitalization process and item legal proceedings  banking regulatory matters 
failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank holding company or an insured bank to a variety of enforcement remedies  including  with respect to an insured bank or savings bank  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and to certain restrictions on its business 
see fdicia below 
basel ii capital standards doral financial may be required to comply with  or decide to adopt  certain new capital and other regulatory requirements proposed by the bcs  as proposed to be implemented in the united states 
these proposed requirements  which are often referred to as the basel ii accord  would  among other things  modify the capital charge applicable to credit risk and incorporate a capital charge for operational risk 
the basel ii accord also places greater reliance on market discipline than current standards 
the basel ii accord standards will be mandatory with respect to banking organizations with total banking assets of billion or more or total on balance sheet foreign exposure of billion or more  and optional for other banking organizations 
as a bank holding company  the threshold for mandatory adoption is determined by reference to the consolidated company 
opting into the basel ii accord standard would require doral financial to implement advanced measurement techniques employing internal estimates of certain key risk drivers to derive capital requirements 
opting into the basel ii accord may also require meeting more onerous computational requirements 
prior to implementation of the new capital regime  a bank holding company will be required to demonstrate to its primary federal regulator that its measurement approaches meet relevant supervisory standards 
us regulators have proposed an effective date of january  for basel ii  with a gradual phase in schedule 
if doral financial does not adopt the basel ii 
table of contents accord  voluntarily  it will remain subject to existing risk based capital requirements  or  when adopted  the basel a standards described below 
in december  the bank regulatory agencies issued a revised notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to a new regulatory capital framework basel a which will be available to banking organizations that are not required to adopt  and have not elected to adopt  the basel ii framework 
doral financial may implement the basel a framework once it has been finalized and an implementation date is established  unless it has adopted the basel ii accord 
the comment period for the basel a proposed rulemaking expires on march   after which the bank regulatory agencies will evaluate the proposed rule in light of the comments that are submitted 
among the key issues under consideration in connection with basel a are the use of loan to value ratios to determine risk weights for most residential mortgages  an increase in the number of risk weight categories to which credit exposures may be assigned  expansion of the use of external credit ratings for certain externally rated exposures  expansion of the range of collateral and guarantors that may qualify an exposure for lower risk weights  and assessment of a risk based capital charge to reflect the risk in securitizations with early amortization provisions 
at this time  doral financial cannot predict the final form the basel a capital framework will take  when it will be implemented  the effect that it might have on doral financial s financial condition or results of its operations  or how these effects might impact doral financial 
doral financial is monitoring the evolution of the basel a capital framework  its potential impact on the company and its banking subsidiaries  and the industry at large 
fdicia under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder fdicia  federal banking regulators must take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia and the regulations thereunder  establish five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least  a risk based tier capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least  and is not subject to any written agreement or regulatory directive to meet a specific capital level 
a depository institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it is not well capitalized but maintains a leverage ratio of at least or at least if given the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  a risk based tier l capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least 
a depository institution is deemed to be undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized institutions unless it is deemed to be significantly or critically undercapitalized 
an institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than  a risk based tier capital ratio of less than or a risk based total capital ratio of less than 
an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to or less of total assets 
a depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives a less than satisfactory examination rating in any one of four categories 
at december   doral financial s banking subsidiaries were well capitalized 
doral financial s  doral bank pr s and doral bank ny s capital categories  as determined by applying the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia  may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of doral financial  doral bank pr or doral bank ny  and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the institutions financial condition and results of operations 
fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system 
in addition  undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 
a depository institution s holding company must guarantee the capital plan  up to an amount equal to the lesser of of the depository institution s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
if a depository 
table of contents institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 
the capital based prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia and their implementing regulations apply to fdic insured depository institutions such as doral bank pr and doral bank ny  but they are not directly applicable to bank holding companies  such as doral financial  which control such institutions 
however  federal banking agencies have indicated that  in regulating bank holding companies  they may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions pursuant to such provisions and regulations 
interstate banking legislation effective june   the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act amended the fdia and certain other statutes to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines  with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency  unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to may   expressly prohibiting interstate mergers 
under the riegle neal act amendments  once a state or national bank has established branches in a state  that bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law 
if a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period  no bank in any other state may establish a branch in the state which has opted out  whether through an acquisition or de novo 
for purposes of the riegle neal act amendments to the fdia  doral bank pr is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks 
however  for purposes of the international banking act the iba  doral bank pr is considered to be a foreign bank and may branch interstate by merger or de novo to the same extent as a domestic bank in doral bank pr s home state 
because doral bank pr does not currently operate in the mainland united states  it has not designated a home state for purposes of the iba 
it is not yet possible to determine how these statutes will be harmonized  with respect either to which federal agency will approve interstate transactions or with respect to which home state determination rules will apply 
as a federal savings bank  doral bank ny is subject to the branching regulations promulgated by the ots 
such regulations allow doral bank ny to branch on an interstate basis without geographic limitations

dividend restrictions the payment of dividends to doral financial by its banking subsidiaries may be affected by regulatory requirements and policies  such as the maintenance of adequate capital 
if  in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority  a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in  or is about to engage in  an unsafe or unsound practice that  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice 
the federal reserve has issued a policy statement that provides that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
in addition  all insured depository institutions are subject to the capital based limitations required by fdicia 
see fdicia above for additional information 
on february   the ots notified doral bank ny that  until further notice  it could not pay any dividends to doral financial without the prior written approval of the ots

on march   doral financial and its principal puerto rico banking subsidiary  doral bank pr  entered into consent orders with the federal reserve  the fdic and the office of the commissioner 
the mutually agreed upon orders prohibit doral bank pr from paying dividends to doral financial without obtaining prior written approval from the fdic and federal reserve

fdic insurance assessments the deposits of doral bank pr and doral bank ny are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
on february  the president of the united states signed the federal deposit insurance reform act of the reform act 
the reform act provides for the merger of the bank insurance fund bif and savings association insurance fund saif into a single deposit insurance fund dif  an increase in the maximum amount of insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts  and possible inflation adjustments in the maximum amount of coverage available with respect to other insured accounts 
in addition  it granted a one time initial assessment credit of approximately billion to recognize institutions past contributions to the fund 
pursuant to fdicia  the fdic has adopted a risk based assessment system  under which the assessment rate for an insured depository institution varies according to the level of risk incurred in its activities 
an institution s risk category is based partly upon whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized 
each insured depository institution is also assigned to one of the following supervisory subgroups a  b or c 
group a institutions are financially sound institutions with only a few minor weaknesses  group b institutions are those that demonstrate weaknesses that  if not corrected  could result in significant deterioration  and group c institutions are those for which there is a substantial probability that the fdic will suffer a loss in connection with the institution  unless effective action is taken to correct the areas of weakness 
for  premiums related to deposits assessed by both the bif and the saif are to be assessed at a rate of between cents and cents per of deposits 
in recent years  well capitalized and well managed banks have in recent years paid no premiums for fdic insurance 
in the future  even well capitalized and well managed banks may be required to pay premiums on deposit insurance 
it is not possible to determine when any such premiums will become assessable or the level of such premiums 
under the reform act  the fdic made significant changes to its risk based assessment system so that effective january  the fdic imposes insurance premiums based upon a matrix that is designed to more closely tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose 
the new fdic risk based assessment system imposes premiums based upon factors that vary depending upon the size of the bank 
these factors are for banks with less than billion in assets capital level  supervisory rating  and certain financial ratios  for banks with billion up to billion in assets capital level  supervisory rating  certain financial ratios and if at least one is available debt issuer ratings  and additional risk information  and for banks with over billion in assets capital level  supervisory rating  debt issuer ratings unless none are available in which case certain financial ratios are used  and additional risk information 
the fdic has adopted a new base schedule of rates that the fdic can adjust up or down  depending on the revenue needs of the dif  and has set initial premiums for that range from cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the lowest risk category to cents per of domestic deposits for banks in the highest risk category 
the new assessment system is expected to result in increased annual assessments on the deposits of doral financial s banking subsidiaries of to basis points per of deposits 
doral 
table of contents financial s banking subsidiaries have available an fdic credit to offset future assessments 
significant increases in the insurance assessments of our bank subsidiaries will increase our costs once the credit is fully utilized 
the deposit insurance funds act of also separated the financing corporation assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the bif and saif assessments 
the amount assessed on individual institutions by the financing corporation is in addition to the amount  if any  paid for deposit insurance according to the fdic s risk related assessment rate schedules 
the current financing corporation annual assessment rate is cents per of deposits 
as of december   doral bank pr and doral bank ny had a deposit base of approximately billion and million  respectively consisting entirely of saif assessment deposits 
brokered deposits fdic regulations adopted under fdicia govern the receipt of brokered deposits 
under these regulations  a bank cannot accept  roll over or renew brokered deposits which term is defined also to include any deposit with an interest rate more than basis points above prevailing rates unless i it is well capitalized  or ii it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic 
a bank that is adequately capitalized may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates specified by regulation 
there are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized 
doral financial does not believe the brokered deposits regulation has had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of its banking subsidiaries  which are currently well capitalized institutions 
as of december   doral bank pr and doral bank ny had a total of approximately billion and million  respectively  of brokered deposits  compared to approximately billion and million  respectively  as of december  doral bank pr and doral bank ny use brokered deposits as a source of inexpensive long term funding 
usa patriot act of on october   the president of the united states signed into law comprehensive anti terrorism legislation known as the usa patriot act of the usa patriot act 
title iii of the usa patriot act substantially broadened the scope of us anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the us treasury department treasury has issued a number of regulations implementing the usa patriot act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions  including doral financial s banking subsidiaries 
the regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing 
failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot act s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
doral financial believes that the cost of compliance with title iii of the usa patriot act is not likely to be material to doral financial

risk factors 
some of the factors that could cause doral financial s actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated are discussed below 
risks relating to the recapitalization process doral financial will need significant outside financing during doral financial will need significant outside financing during  principally for the payment of its million floating rate senior notes that mature on july  and of amounts required under the settlement agreement dated april  in respect of the consolidated securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation brought against the company following the announcement of the restatement of its financial statements in the company currently estimates that these external funding needs for will range between approximately million and million without considering the distribution of any proceeds from the sale of doral bank ny s branches 
doral financial is in active negotiations with a private equity firm the lead sponsor regarding a substantial investment in the company by a new bank holding company 
the new holding company would be capitalized by a number of private equity and other sophisticated financial investors  and their investment would take into account the various ownership restrictions imposed by banking regulations 
the lead sponsor is actively engaged in discussions with a number of potential investors to raise the contemplated capital for the new holding company to invest in doral 
based on its discussions to date  the company believes that the proposed transaction  if executed  would be accomplished predominantly through the issuance of new equity securities at a discount to market price and would result in very significant dilution to the company s existing shareholders 
if the company is successful in entering into the proposed transaction and it is consummated on a timely basis  the company believes that the proposed transaction would adequately satisfy its capital and liquidity needs 
however  the company cannot provide assurances that it will ultimately be able to enter into an agreement with respect to the proposed transaction 

table of contents the proposed transaction would be subject to various conditions precedent  including but not limited to the receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals  the receipt of sufficient equity commitments from other investors  final district court approval of the settlement agreement in respect of the consolidated securities class action and shareholder derivative claims brought against the company  the absence of certain adverse developments and other customary closing conditions 
although the company would attempt to enter into an alternative transaction that would provide it with the liquidity and capital needed to continue its business in the event that it is unable to enter into the proposed transaction  the company cannot provide assurance that it would succeed in entering into such a transaction  especially in the limited time available prior to the july  maturity of the senior notes 
the failure to refinance the senior notes and recapitalize the holding company would have a material adverse effect on  and impair  the holding company s financial condition and ability to operate as going concern 
this would likely cause the holding company to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws  which would likely result in the elimination of all value of the holding company s outstanding common stock 
in addition  banking regulators could take actions to protect the interests of the depositors of the company s banking subsidiaries  which actions could have a material adverse effect on the value that the holding company may realize on its investment in doral bank pr and other subsidiaries 
the consummation of a recapitalization transaction  if any  will likely result in very significant dilution to the company s existing shareholders 
the company believes that a recapitalization transaction  if any  would be accomplished primarily through the issuance of new equity securities  which would result in very significant dilution to the company s existing shareholders 
as a result  new investors would have the ability to determine matters requiring shareholder approval  including without limitation  the election and removal of directors  business combinations  changes of control and sales of all or substantially all of doral financial s assets 
risks relating to the holding company s deteriorated financial condition doral financial s deteriorated earnings have resulted in a reduction of doral financial s capital position and  together with the pending debt maturity and downgrades to its credit ratings  have adversely affected its operations and the ability of the holding company to access funding 
the company recorded significantly lower income in than in  and a significant loss in the company s deteriorated earnings have adversely affected the holding company s capital position  which  combined with the maturing of the company s million floating rate senior notes on july   have lead to a series of downgrades in the company s credit ratings 
doral financial is a party to two repurchase facilities with outstanding balances totaling approximately million that are secured by whole loans and subordinated mortgage securities 
these facilities are payable on demand or on a monthly basis 
these facilities may be terminated by the lenders following a material adverse change in the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
one of these facilities also contains a covenant that requires doral financial to remain well capitalized under the applicable banking regulatory guidelines 
as a result of the losses incurred during  doral financial s leverage ratio fell below the minimum threshold for the holding company to classify as well capitalized 
doral financial is in discussions with both lenders to avoid a termination of the facilities as a result of the losses suffered by doral financial or as a result of the holding company falling below the well capitalized level 
the termination of either of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on the holding company s liquidity position 
in addition  the reduced capital position of the company may make other counterparties reluctant to continue to do business with the company 
fnma may also terminate doral financial s status as an approved seller because it no longer meets the standards for being well capitalized 
while the company is in discussions with fnma to avoid such action  no assurance can be given that fnma will not terminate the company s status as an approved seller 
as of december   doral bank pr and doral bank ny were in compliance with all the regulatory capital requirements that were applicable to them as a state non member bank and a federal savings bank  respectively  and were considered well capitalized 

table of contents following doral financial s announcement of the need to restate its financial statements  the major rating agencies downgraded doral financial s ratings in a series of actions 
s p lowered the long term senior debt and counterparty ratings of doral financial from bbb to b and placed the ratings on credit watch negative 
moody s lowered doral financial s long term senior debt rating from baa to b and placed the ratings on outlook of credit negative 
fitch lowered doral financial s long term senior debt rating from bbb to bb and placed the ratings on rating watch negative 
early in  doral financial s ratings were downgraded from b to b with a negative outlook by s p  from b to b by moody s and from bb to b by fitch 
these debt and financial strength ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies 
as such  they may be changed  suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in  or the unavailability of  information or based on other circumstances 
ratings may also be withdrawn at the request of doral financial s management 
these ratings actions have affected and will continue to affect doral financial s business and results of operations in a number of ways 
since the restatement  the holding company s traditional sources of funding from the capital markets have been disrupted and the holding company has had to rely primarily on servicing income  repurchase agreements backed by mortgage loans and subordinated mortgage securities  and sales of loans in the secondary market to government agencies or us financial institutions as its primary sources of liquidity 
the requirements for sale of non conforming loans in the us secondary market are stricter than those existing in the puerto rico market prior to the restatement  which has affected the company s ability to sell non conforming loans 
in addition  as a result of existing regulatory consent orders  the holding company s access to the liquidity at its banking subsidiaries is significantly restricted 
at the same time  the liquidity of the holding company has been materially adversely affected by expenses related to the restatement and related legal and accounting matters and increased demands for loan repurchases pursuant to recourse or warranty obligations 
although the holding company continues to pay its debts as they become due  as discussed above  doral financial will need significant outside financing during  principally for the payment of its million floating rate senior notes that mature on july  and to meet certain other working capital and contractual needs of the holding company 
the weakened financial condition of the holding company may also affect doral financial s servicing business 
the weakened financial position of the company may also affect its servicing business 
the holding company holds the contractual rights to service loans for third parties  including its banking subsidiaries 
servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans 
failure to service the loans in accordance with contract requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 
in general  doral financial s servicing agreements are terminable by the investors for cause 
in addition  the servicing agreements with fnma allow fnma to request collateral for the total amount of loans being serviced subject to recourse 
to date  the company has posted million in collateral to secure million in recourse servicing with fnma 
if requested  the holding company would not have the ability to post collateral to fully secure its recourse servicing 
in addition  the company s servicing agreements with fnma permit fnma to terminate the company s servicing rights if fnma determines that changes in the company s financial condition have materially adversely affected the company s ability to satisfactorily service the mortgage loans 
approximately of doral financial s mortgage loan servicing on behalf of third parties relates to mortgage servicing for fnma 
termination of doral financial s servicing rights with respect to fnma or other parties for which it provides servicing could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of doral financial 
continuing negative publicity may affect our business 
as a result of the restatement of the company s prior period financial statements and the company s deteriorated earnings and financial condition  the company has been the subject of negative publicity 
this negative publicity may inhibit the company s ability to attract or retain customers and maintain customary business relationships with counterparties 
continuing negative publicity could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents doral financial may fail to retain and attract key employees and management personnel 
doral financial s success has been and will continue to be influenced by its ability to retain and attract key employees and management personnel  including senior and middle management 
doral financial s ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel may be adversely affected as a result of the workload and stress associated with the resolution of legacy issues related to the restatement and recapitalization efforts  and related risks and uncertainties 
risks relating to the restatement process doral financial has restated its financial statements 
doral financial will continue to suffer adverse effects from the restatement of its previously issued financial statements that were included in its annual report on form k for the year ended december   as amended the form k 
in the form k  doral financial restated its previously reported financial statements for the years ended december     and the unaudited selected quarterly financial information for each of the four quarters of  and as a result of the restatement  doral financial became subject to fines and settlements and could become subject to further fines  penalties or damages 
doral financial and its banking subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of various banking regulators and have entered into consent orders with these regulators  and these regulators could take action against the company or its banking subsidiaries 
as a regulated financial services firm  doral financial s good standing with its regulators is of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of its businesses 
doral financial is subject to supervision and regulation by the federal reserve  doral bank pr is subject to supervision and regulation by the fdic and the office of the commissioner and doral bank ny is subject to supervision and regulation by the ots and the fdic 
doral financial is responding to inquiries and requests for documents from the federal reserve and the other banking regulators of the company and its subsidiaries regarding the issues arising from the restatement and related internal control matters and the holding company s deteriorated financial condition 
federal banking regulators  in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties  have significant discretion and power to initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
the enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators include  among others  the ability to assess civil monetary penalties  to issue cease and desist or removal orders  to require written agreements and to initiate injunctive actions 
as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings in this annual report on form k  doral financial and doral bank pr have entered into consent orders with the federal reserve  the fdic and the office of the commissioner  which  among other things  prohibit the company s banking subsidiaries from paying dividends to the parent company  and prohibit doral financial from paying dividends to its common and preferred shareholders  without regulatory approval 
doral financial cannot predict whether any of these banking regulators will take any further action with respect to doral financial or its banking subsidiaries  or  if any such further action were taken  whether such action would have a material adverse effect on doral financial 
the company s banking regulators could take additional actions to protect the company s banking subsidiaries or to ensure that the holding company remains as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries  and such actions could have adverse effects on one or more of the company s stakeholders 
doral financial has been the subject of an investigation by the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york  which could require it to pay substantial fines or penalties 
on august   doral financial received a grand jury subpoena from the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york regarding the production of certain documents  including financial statements and corporate  auditing and accounting records prepared during the period relating to the restatement of doral financial s financial statements 
doral financial cannot predict when this investigation will be completed or what 
table of contents the results of this investigation will be 
the effects and results of this investigation could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
adverse developments related to this investigation  including any expansion of its scope  could negatively impact the company and could divert efforts and attention of its management team from doral financial s ordinary business operations 
doral financial may be required to pay material fines  judgments or settlements or suffer other penalties  each of which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
this investigation could adversely affect doral financial s ability to obtain  and or increase the cost of obtaining  directors and officers liability insurance and or other types of insurance  which could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s businesses  results of operations and financial condition 
risks relating to doral financial s business fluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact doral financial s business 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk affecting doral financial 
changes in interest rates can adversely affect the following areas of its business the number of mortgage loans it originates and purchases  the net interest income it earns on loans and securities  its gains on the sale of loans  the value of its securities holdings  and the value of its servicing asset and ios 
significant increases in interest rates reduce demand for mortgage loan originations and refinancing 
higher interest rates increase the cost of mortgage loans to consumers and therefore reduce consumer demand for mortgage loans 
reduced demand for mortgage loans negatively impacts doral financial s profits because it results in lower loan originations by doral financial and lower mortgage origination income 
demand for refinance loans is generally more sensitive to increases in interest rates 
significant changes in interest rates reduce net interest income 
doral financial is liability sensitive on average the liabilities mature sooner than the assets and thus significant increases in short term interest rates reduce net interest income  which is the most important component of doral financial s earnings 
net interest income is the difference between the interest received by doral financial on its interest earning assets and the interest paid on its borrowings 
most of doral financial s interest earning assets  like its mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  are long term assets with fixed interest rates 
in contrast  most of doral financial s borrowings are short term 
when interest rates rise  doral financial must pay more in interest on its borrowings while the interest earned on its assets does not rise as quickly 
this causes profits to decrease 
this adverse impact on earnings is greater when the slope of the yield curve flattens  that is  when short term interest rates increase more than long term rates 
significant increases in interest rates may reduce the value of doral financial mortgage loans and securities 
significant increases in interest rates may reduce the value of doral financial s financial assets and may have an adverse impact on its earnings and financial condition 
doral financial owns a substantial portfolio of mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and other debt securities with fixed interest rates 
the market value of an obligation with a fixed interest rate generally decreases when prevailing interest rates rise 
in addition  most of doral financial s remaining ios are related to mortgage pools in which the pass through rates payable to investors are floating rates based on a spread over the three month libor 
accordingly  significant unexpected increases in short term interest rates reduce the spread received on doral financial s ios and adversely affect its value 
for mortgage loan sales contracts that are not subject to interest rate caps  to the extent that the interest rate payable to investors on the mortgage loans underlying the floating rate ios exceeds the weighted average coupon on such mortgage loans  the change in fair value of the company s ios may exceed the carrying value of the ios  creating a liability instead of an asset 
doral financial must recognize decreases in the value of the ios against its current period earnings 

table of contents significant reductions in interest rates may adversely affect the value of doral financial s servicing assets 
significant decreases in long term interest rates lead to increases in the prepayment of mortgages by borrowers  which may reduce the value of doral financial s servicing assets 
doral financial s servicing assets represent the estimated present value of the normal servicing fees net of related servicing costs doral financial expects to receive on the mortgages it services over their expected term 
if prepayments increase above expected levels  the value of doral financial s servicing assets will decrease because the amount of future fees expected to be received by doral financial from the servicing assets will decrease 
defective and repurchased loans may harm doral financial s business and financial condition 
in connection with the sale and securitization of loans  doral financial is required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding the company and the loans being sold or securitized 
doral financial s obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan  and they relate to  among other things compliance with laws and regulations  underwriting standards  the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file  and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan 
a loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell  impact doral financial s ability to obtain third party financing for the loan  and be unsaleable or saleable only at a significant discount 
if such a loan is sold before doral financial detects a non compliance  doral financial may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly  or doral financial may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such loss  either of which could reduce doral financial s cash available for operations and liquidity 
the company s current management team believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market s requirements  but no assurance can be given that mistakes will not be made  or that certain employees will not deliberately violate the company s lending policies 
doral financial seeks to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws  if possible  and selling or re selling such loans 
doral financial does not have a reserve on its financial statements for possible losses related to repurchases resulting from representation and warranty violations because it does not expect any such losses to be significant 
doral financial cannot assure you  however  that losses associated with defective loans will not adversely impact its results of operations or financial condition 
see liquidity and capital resources under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 
doral financial must identify and satisfy the requirements of new loan sale channels for its non conforming mortgage loan production 
prior to the announcement that it would have to restate its financial statements  doral financial historically sold a significant portion of its non conforming loan production to local financial institutions at relatively high gain on sale margins through the creation of floating rate ios 
since the announcement of the restatement  the company has not sold its non conforming loan production in the local market 
in the fourth quarter of  doral financial was able to sell non conforming loans to us financial institutions  on a non recourse basis  in transactions that did not involve the creation of ios and resulted in a significantly lower gain on sale margin 
while doral financial is seeking to broaden sales channels for its non conforming mortgage loan production  it anticipates that these new sales channels will continue to result in considerably lower gain on sale margins compared to those obtained in past sales in the local puerto rico market  thereby adversely affecting their profitability 
in addition  these new channels require that the company maintain more stringent underwriting and pricing criteria  which has affected and may continue to affect the company s share of puerto rico s loan production 
doral financial cannot assure you that it will be able to create a liquid market for its non conforming loan production 

table of contents doral financial is exposed to credit risks from mortgage loans held pending sale and mortgage loans that have been sold subject to recourse arrangements 
doral financial is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security 
doral financial also often retains  through recourse arrangements  part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans that do not qualify for gnma  fnma or fhlmc sale or exchange programs and consequently may suffer losses on these loans 
doral financial suffers losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property 
doral financial is subject to default risk in connection with the loans it originates for its own portfolio 
doral financial is subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans originated for its own portfolio  including those loans originated by its banking subsidiaries for investment 
doral financial establishes provisions for loan and lease losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain its allowance for loans and lease losses at a level which management deems to be appropriate based upon management s assessment of prior loss experience  the volume and type of lending being conducted  industry standards  past due loans  general economic conditions in its market and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although doral financial s management utilizes its best judgment in providing for loan losses  there can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of probable loan losses or that doral financial will not have to increase its provisions for loan and lease losses in the future as a result of future increases in non performing loans or for other reasons beyond its control 
any such increases in doral financial s provisions for loan and lease losses could have a material adverse impact on doral financial s future financial condition and results of operations 
doral financial is subject to greater credit risk with respect to its portfolio of construction and commercial loans 
doral financial invests in construction loans and mortgage loans secured by income producing residential buildings and commercial properties through its banking subsidiaries which are subject to greater credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans 
these types of loans involve greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because they are larger in size  concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic conditions 
the properties securing these loans are also harder to dispose of in foreclosure 
management has identified several material weaknesses in doral financial s internal control over financial reporting 
doral financial s management has concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december   as a result of several material weaknesses described in this annual report on form k 
as a result  this report includes an adverse opinion from pricewaterhousecoopers llp  the company s independent registered public accounting firm  on doral financial s internal control over financial reporting 
a discussion of the material weaknesses that have been identified by management can be found in item a of part ii of this annual report on form k 
each material weakness results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
the company s ability to file its periodic reports with the sec in a timely manner may also be adversely affected by the existence of ineffective controls 
we have devoted substantial internal and external resources to addressing the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting over the last couple of years 
we expect to continue spending significant resources until we remedy all the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
doral financial s business is concentrated in puerto rico 
doral financial s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in puerto rico 
consequently  its financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 
adverse political or economic developments  decreases in housing values or natural disasters  such as hurricanes  could result in a downturn in loan originations  an increase in the level of nonperforming assets  an increase in the rate of 
table of contents foreclosure loss on mortgage loans and a reduction in the value of doral financial s loans and loan servicing portfolio 
in particular  if the commonwealth of puerto rico is unable to generate the projected revenues or savings from the fiscal and tax reforms implemented during  certain commonwealth government agencies may not be able to meet their payroll obligations and may be forced to suspend their operations  as was the case in recently  the government of puerto rico announced a possible lack of budgetary funds to complete the fiscal year ending june  of approximately million 
similar conditions at the end of fiscal year led to a two week government shutdown 
it is impossible for the company to predict what effect such a government shutdown could have on the puerto rico economy  but a prolonged shutdown could lead to an increase in delinquencies in mortgage and consumer loans 
these factors could materially and adversely affect doral financial s condition and results of operations 
the economy of puerto rico is slowing down 
beginning in and continuing during  a number of key economic indicators suggested that the economy of puerto rico was slowing down 
this trend has continued during construction remained weak during the first half of fiscal year  as the combination of rising interest rates  the commonwealth s fiscal situation and decreasing public investment in construction projects affected the sector 
although payroll employment in construction for the first seven months of fiscal year increased  cement sales  a real indicator of construction activity  declined by as compared to the same period for fiscal year exports decreased by from july to november of fiscal year  while imports increased by  leading to the first registered negative trade balance of the last decade in november retail sales have also been declining since april and cumulative figures for the first four months of fiscal year showed a decline of 
tourism activity has also declined during the first five months of fiscal year total hotel registrations for the first five months of fiscal year declined as compared to the same period for fiscal year although the unemployment rate for the first seven months of fiscal year was  a decline from for the same period of fiscal year  this decline was due to a drop in the labor force participation rate 
in general  the puerto rico economy continued its trend of decreasing growth and ended the first half of fiscal year with minimal momentum  primarily due to weaker manufacturing  softer consumption and decreased government investment in construction 
the above economic concerns and uncertainty in the private and public sectors may also have an adverse effect on the credit quality of the company s loan portfolios  as delinquency rates are expected to increase in the short term  until the economy stabilizes 
also  a potential reduction in consumer spending may also impact growth in other interest and non interest revenue sources of the company 
doral financial is subject to risks in servicing loans for others 
doral financial s profitability may also be adversely affected by mortgage loan delinquencies and defaults on mortgage loans that it services for third parties 
under many of its servicing contracts  doral financial must advance all or part of the scheduled payments to the owner of an outstanding mortgage loan  even when mortgage loan payments are delinquent 
in addition  in order to protect their liens on mortgaged properties  owners of mortgage loans usually require that doral financial  as servicer  pay mortgage and hazard insurance and tax payments on schedule even if sufficient escrow funds are not available 
doral financial generally recovers its advances from the mortgage owner or from liquidation proceeds when the mortgage loan is foreclosed 
however  in the interim  doral financial must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
doral financial must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans 
in addition  if a default is not cured  the mortgage loan will be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and doral financial will not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the profitability of doral financial s operations 
doral financial faces significant competition from other financial institutions  many of which have significantly greater assets  capital and other resources 
as a result  many of doral financial s competitors have advantages in 
table of contents conducting certain businesses and providing certain services 
this competitive environment could force doral financial to increase the rates it offers on deposits or lower the rates it charges on loans and  consequently  could adversely affect the profitability of doral financial s operations 
changes in statutes and regulations could adversely affect doral financial 
as a financial institution  doral financial is subject to extensive federal and local governmental supervision and regulation 
any change in regulation  whether by applicable regulators or as a result of legislation enacted by the united states congress or by the applicable local legislatures  could have a substantial impact on doral financial s operations and profitability

while the company experienced a decrease in average interest earning assets during  with average interest earning assets decreasing from billion for to billion for  the decrease in assets was more than offset by a decrease in interest bearing liabilities 
the reduction in average interest earning assets reflects the sale during of approximately billion in mortgage loans as part of the restructuring of loan transfer transactions with local financial institutions that were reclassified as secured borrowings as part of the restatement

as previously disclosed  during the year ended december   the company reassessed its plan to sell certain portions of its mortgage portfolio classified as held for sale  specifically loans with a low fico score or with documentation and compliance issues  and transferred million from its mortgage loan held for sale portfolio to its loan receivable portfolio

for the year ended december   doral financial reported an income tax benefit of million  compared to a tax expense of million for the income tax benefit primarily reflects the amount of pre tax losses incurred during  together with an increase in the company s net deferred tax asset as a result of various agreements entered into with the puerto rico treasury department 
during the year ended december   the company had other comprehensive income of approximately million related principally to the positive impact of the decrease in long term interest rates on the value of the company s portfolio of available for sale securities 
as of december   the company s accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income tax benefit was million  compared to million as of december  doral financial s loan production for was billion  compared to billion for  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in doral financial s loan production was due to a number of factors  including changes in underwriting standards  economic conditions in puerto rico  and competition from other financial institutions

update on recapitalization process doral financial will need significant outside financing during  principally for the payment of its million floating rate senior notes that mature on july  and of amounts required under the settlement agreement dated april  in respect of the consolidated securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation brought against the company following the announcement of the restatement of its financial statements in the company currently estimates that these external funding needs for will range between approximately million and million without considering the distribution of any proceeds from the sale of doral bank ny s branches 
the company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report have been prepared assuming doral financial will continue as a going concern 
in light of the holding company s liquidity needs and the risks and uncertainties surrounding its recapitalization process  the holding company s liquidity position raises substantial doubts about the holding company s ability to continue operating as a going concern without such recapitalization 
doral financial is in active negotiations with a private equity firm the lead sponsor regarding a substantial investment in the company by a new bank holding company 
the new holding company would be capitalized by a number of private equity and other sophisticated financial investors  and their investment would take into account the various ownership restrictions imposed by banking regulations 
the lead sponsor is actively engaged in discussions with a number of potential investors to raise the contemplated capital for the new holding company to invest in doral 
based on its discussions to date  the company believes that the proposed transaction  if executed  would be accomplished predominantly through the issuance of new equity securities at a discount to market price and would result in very significant dilution to the company s existing shareholders 
if the company is successful in entering into the proposed transaction and it is consummated on a timely basis  the company believes that the proposed transaction would adequately satisfy its capital and liquidity needs 
however  the company cannot provide assurances that it will ultimately be able to enter into an agreement with respect to the proposed transaction 
the proposed transaction would be subject to various conditions precedent  including but not limited to the receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals  the receipt of sufficient equity commitments from other investors  final district court approval of the settlement agreement in respect of the consolidated securities class action and shareholder derivative claims brought against the company  the absence of certain adverse developments and other customary closing conditions 
although the company would attempt to enter into an alternative transaction that would provide it with the liquidity and capital needed to continue its business in the event that it is unable to enter into the proposed transaction  the company cannot provide assurance that it would succeed in entering into such a transaction  especially in the limited time available prior to the july  maturity of the senior notes 
the failure to refinance the senior notes and recapitalize the holding company would have a material adverse effect on  and impair  the holding company s financial condition and ability to operate as going concern

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  income and expenses in doral financial s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of these estimates are critical to the presentation of doral financial s financial condition since they are particularly sensitive to the company s judgment and are highly complex in nature 
doral financial believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances as of december  however  given the sensitivity of doral financial s consolidated financial statements to these estimates  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in doral financial s results of operations or financial condition 
various elements of doral financial s accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
note to doral financial s consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the most significant accounting policies followed by doral financial in the preparation of its financial statements 
the accounting policies that have a significant impact on doral financial s statements and that require the most judgment are set forth below 
fair value measurement the measurement of fair value is fundamental to the presentation of doral financial s financial condition and results of operations 
fair value is defined under gaap as the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
gaap indicates that fair value must be based on observable for example  quoted market prices 
if observable market prices are not available  the techniques management uses for estimating fair value measurements should incorporate assumptions that individuals in the market would use 
if that information is not available  then gaap permits an entity to use its own assumptions  as long as there is no indication that the market would use a different assumption 
doral financial recognizes many of its financial instruments at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition  with changes in these fair values recognized as gains and losses in the consolidated statements of income or deferred  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
set forth below is a summary of doral financial s sources of fair value for its investment securities  held in the securities held for trading and available for sale portfolios as well as its derivatives  retained interests and mortgage loans held for sale as of december  
table of contents carrying amount prices provided prices by other internal external actively external valuation valuation in thousands quoted sources models models tax exempt gnmas collateralized mortgage obligations puerto rico government obligations mortgage backed and us treasury and us government sponsored agency securities derivative instruments other investment securities interest only strips servicing assets msrs mortgage loans held for sale the market value of mortgage loans held for sale is generally based on quoted market prices for mortgage backed securities  adjusted to reflect particular characteristics such as guarantee fees  actual delinquency and credit risk associated with the individual loans 
fair value affects doral financial s earnings in a variety of ways 
for certain financial instruments that are carried at fair value such as securities held for trading  including ios and derivative instruments  changes in fair value are recognized in current period earnings as net gain loss on securities held for trading 
for securities available for sale  changes in fair value are generally deferred  net of tax  in aoci  a component of stockholders equity 
the deferred gains and losses in aoci  initially measured at fair value  are recognized in earnings over time when the securities are sold or when impairments are recognized 
in addition  impairments of mortgage loans held for sale are recognized in earnings through lower of cost or market valuation adjustments 
finally  impairments or recoveries of msrs are recognized in earnings through an impairment allowance as part of servicing income 
the estimation of fair values reflects doral financial s judgment regarding appropriate valuation methods and assumptions 
the selection of a method to estimate fair value for each type of financial instrument depends on both the reliability and availability of relevant market data 
the amount of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of a financial instrument is affected by a number of factors  such as type of instrument  the liquidity of the market for the instrument and the contractual characteristics of the instrument 
for financial instruments with active markets and readily available market prices  doral financial estimates fair values based on independent price quotations obtained from third parties  including dealer quotes or direct market observations 
dealer quotes are prices that are obtained from third party dealers that generally make markets in the relevant products 
the quoted price is an indication of the price at which the dealer would consider transacting in normal market conditions 
direct market observations are prices that are retrieved from sources in which market trades are executed  such as electronic trading platforms 
certain instruments  such as the company s portfolio of ios  are less actively traded and  therefore  fair value is based on valuation models using market data inputs adjusted by the company s particular characteristics  when appropriate

gain or loss on mortgage loan sales the company generally securitizes as whole loans a significant portion of the residential mortgage loans it originates 
fha and va loans are generally securitized into gnma mortgage backed securities and held as trading securities 
after holding these securities for a period of time  doral financial sells these securities for cash 
conforming conventional loans are generally sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or institutional investors or 
table of contents exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial sells for cash through broker dealers 
the company generally attempts to sell mortgage loans that do not conform to gnma  fnma or fhlmc requirements non conforming loans as whole loan pools to financial institutions 
as part of its mortgage loan sale and securitization activities  doral financial generally retains the right to service the mortgage loans it sells 
in connection with the sale of loans  generally non conforming mortgage loan pools  doral financial may also retain certain interests in the loans sold  such as the right to receive any interest payments on such loans above the contractual pass through rate payable to the investor 
doral financial determines the gain on sale of a mortgage backed security or loan pool by allocating the carrying value of the underlying mortgage loans between the mortgage backed security or mortgage loan pool sold and its retained interests  based on their relative estimated fair values 
the gain on sale reported by doral financial is the difference between the proceeds received from the sale and the cost allocated to the loans sold 
the proceeds include cash and other assets received in the transaction primarily msrs less any liabilities incurred ie  liabilities for recourse or representations and warranty provisions 
the reported gain or loss is the difference between the proceeds from the sale of the security or mortgage loan pool and its allocated cost after allocating a portion of the cost to the retained interests  and  in the case of loan sales with recourse provisions  the recourse obligation assumed by the company 
the amount of gain on sale is therefore influenced by the values of the msrs and retained interest recorded at the time of sale

retained interest valuation doral financial s sale and securitization activities generally result in the recording of one or two types of retained interests  msrs and ios 
msrs represent the estimated present value of the normal servicing fees net of related servicing costs expected to be received on a loan being serviced over the expected term of the loan 
msrs entitle doral financial to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balance of the loans 
table of contents serviced and the contractual servicing fee 
the annual servicing fees generally range between and basis points  less  in certain cases  any corresponding guarantee fee 
in addition  msrs may entitle doral financial  depending on the contract language  to ancillary income including late charges  float income  and prepayment penalties net of the appropriate expenses incurred for performing the servicing functions 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with such loans is evaluated based on ancillary income  including float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
msrs are classified as servicing assets in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
any servicing liability recognized is included as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
ios represent the estimated present value of the cash flows retained by the company that are generated by the underlying fixed rate mortgages as adjusted for expected losses and prepayments  as well as by the estimated market value of any embedded cap  if applicable after subtracting the interest rate payable to the investor  and a contractual servicing fee 
prior to the first half of  in connection with its whole loan sales of non conforming loans  the company generally agreed to pay investors a variable pass through rate based on a spread over the month libor that resets quarterly  while the underlying mortgages generate interest at a fixed rate 
generally  the loans sold under a floating rate arrangement are subject to interest rate caps or calls set at or below the weighted average coupon less the servicing fee on the pools of loans and to a lesser extent based on a spread above the initial contractual pass through rate at the time of sale  which does not exceed the weighted average coupon on the loans 
for mortgage loan sale contracts that are not subject to interest rate caps  to the extent that the interest rate payable to investors on the mortgage loans underlying the floating rate ios exceeds the weighted average coupon on such mortgage loans  the change in the fair value of the company s floating rate ios may exceed the carrying value of the ios  creating a liability instead of an asset 
since july  the company has refrained from structuring loan sales that generate ios based on variable rates 
as of december   the carrying value of the ios of million is related to billion of outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans sold to investors 
ios are classified as securities held for trading in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
unlike us treasury and agency mortgage backed securities  the fair value of msrs and ios cannot be readily determined because they are not traded in active securities markets 
doral financial determined the initial fair value of its msrs based on a market valuation received from a third party 
the market valuation received for the company s entire servicing portfolio governmental  conforming and non conforming portfolios is calculated by stratifying the portfolio by predominant risk characteristics loan type and coupon 
under a market valuation approach  the fair value of the servicing assets is determined based on a combination of market information  such as trading activity  benchmarking of servicing assets and cash flow modeling 
once msrs have been recorded  they must be periodically evaluated for impairment 
impairment occurs when the current fair value of the msrs falls below their carrying value 
if msrs are impaired  the impairment is recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the msrs is adjusted through a valuation allowance 
if the value of the msrs subsequently increases  the recovery in value is recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the msrs is adjusted through a reduction in the valuation allowance 
as of december   the msrs impairment valuation allowance was million 
doral financial has also engaged the same third party to prepare an other than temporary impairment analysis to evaluate whether a loss in the value of the msrs  if any  was permanent or not 
if impairment is deemed to be other than temporary  the valuation allowance is applied to reduce the cost basis of the msrs 
the amortization of the msrs is based on an income forecast cash flow method 
the income forecast method is based on the forecasted cash flows determined by the third party market valuation and the amortization is calculated by applying to the carrying amount of the msrs the ratio of the cash flows projected for the current period to total remaining forecasted cash flow 
to determine the value of its portfolio of variable ios  doral financial uses an internal valuation model that forecasts expected cash flows using forward libor rates derived from the libor swap yield curve at the date of the valuation 
prepayment assumptions and discount rates incorporated into the valuation model for variable and fixed ios are based on publicly available  independently verifiable  market data and statistically derived relationships between the company s and the fnma s us mainland mortgage pool prepayment experiences 

table of contents to determine prepayment assumptions  doral financial calculates its prepayment forecasts based on the median of static prepayment forecasts by mortgage backed securities dealers obtained from bloomberg 
this median is then adjusted using a regression analysis that correlates the prepayment experiences of the company s non conforming loan portfolio with that of us mainland fnma mortgages 
to estimate the adjustment equation between the us mainland and the company s portfolio  the company calculates a quarterly constant prepayment rate cpr for each pool of its non conforming loan portfolio and compares it to that of a generic fnma pool with similar coupon and seasonality 
to mitigate risks of misestimating the equation  the company updates its regression analysis on a quarterly basis as new data become available 
this methodology resulted in a cpr of for  for and for the change in the cpr between and was principally attributable to a change in the composition of the variable io portfolio 
the change in the cpr between and was principally attributable to a change in the composition of the company s non conforming loan portfolio during  the weighted average coupon of the portfolio was lower than in  as well as to the increase in interest rates  which led to a decrease in forecasted prepayment rates 
the io internal valuation model utilizes a z spread approach to calculate discount rates 
the z spread is the market recognized spread over the swap curve that takes into consideration additional yield requirements based on the risk characteristics of a particular instrument 
as a result  the discount rates used by the company in the valuation of its ios change according to their components  the swap curve and the z spread 
the z spread incorporates a premium for prepayment optionality and liquidity risk over the period end swap curve 
as a result of a review by management of current liquidity conditions in the puerto rico secondary market for non conforming loans  the liquidity premium incorporated in the model was increased by basis points in light of the more stringent requirements of the us secondary mortgage market which has now become the principal outlet for this type of loan 
doral financial obtains the z spread from major investment banking firms 
this methodology resulted in a discount rate of for  for and for the valuation model values fixed and floating rate ios on a contract by contract basis 
for fixed ios  the valuation model projects a fixed spread cash flow through the life of the underlying mortgages and applies a discount rate to obtain the present value of the projected cash flows 
for the valuation of variable ios  each contract is segregated into unhedged cash flows and the contract s embedded optionality calls  caps and floors 
each component  except embedded calls  is valued independently 
for the unprotected cash flows from the io  the model incorporates widely used financial techniques  such as cubic spline and bootstrapping  to estimate forward libor rates 
cubic spline is an interpolation technique used to make a continuous curve out of the quoted yields 
using the continuous set of yields to maturity estimated using cubic spline  the spot rate curve or zero coupon curve is derived with the bootstrapping methodology 
once a complete set of spot rates is obtained  the model generates the implied forward rates used in the valuation 
the model uses the black option valuation formula to value interest rate caps and floors 
the black formula uses as inputs the strike price of the floor or cap  forward libor rates  volatilities and discount rates to estimate the option value 
with respect to the embedded calls  doral financial made the determination that due to the characteristics of the portfolio and the expected terms for any sale of such portfolio in the secondary market  its value was not significant 
consequently  the company has not developed a valuation model for embedded calls and the value of such calls  if any  is not included in the company s financial statements 
as of december  and the carrying value of ios reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition was million and million  respectively 
for ios  doral financial recognizes as interest income through the life of the io the excess of all estimated cash flows attributable to these interests over their recorded balance using the effective yield method in accordance with emerging issue task force eitf issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
doral financial recognizes as interest income the excess of the cash collected from the borrowers over the yield payable to investors  less a servicing fee retained spread  up to an amount equal to the yield on the ios that equals the discount rate used in the internal valuation model 
doral financial accounts for any excess retained spread as amortization to the gross io capitalized at inception 
the company updates its estimates of expected cash flows periodically and recognizes changes in calculated effective yield on a prospective basis 
the following table presents a detail of the cash flows received and 
table of contents the losses on the valuation of doral financial s portfolio of ios for  and based on the internal valuation model year ended december  in thousands total cash flows received on io portfolio amortization of ios  as offset to cash flows net cash flows recognized as interest income losses on the value of the ios as discussed above  doral financial classifies its ios as securities held for trading with changes in the fair value recognized in current earnings as a component of net gain loss on securities held for trading 
the following table shows the weighted averages of the key economic assumptions used by the company in its external and internal valuation models and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate percent and percent adverse changes in those assumptions for mortgage loans at december  dollars in thousands servicing assets interest only strips carrying amount of retained interest weighted average expected life in years constant prepayment rate weighted average annual rate decrease in fair value due to adverse change decrease in fair value due to adverse change residual cash flow discount rate weighted average annual rate decrease in fair value due to adverse change decrease in fair value due to adverse change these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in the table above  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments  which may magnify or offset the sensitivities 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in the fair value of the company s ios  the constant prepayment rate and the weighted average expected life under the company s valuation model  given several hypothetical instantaneous and parallel increases or decreases in interest rates 
as of december   all of the mortgage loan sale contracts underlying the company s floating rate ios were subject to interest rate caps  which prevent changes in fair value of floating rate ios from exceeding the carrying value of the ios 

table of contents dollars in thousands constant weighted average change in interest prepayment expected life change in fair value rates basis points rate years of interest only strips change base the company s ios included in the table above are primarily variable rate ios  subject to interest rate caps 
accordingly  in a declining interest rate scenario as shown in the table  decreases in the fair value of the interest rate caps more than offset the otherwise positive impact that declining interest rates would have on the fair values of the ios 
this results in a net reduction in the fair values of the ios 
valuation of trading securities and derivatives doral financial s net gain loss on securities held for trading includes gains and losses  whether realized or unrealized  on securities accounted for as held for trading  including ios  as well as various other financial instruments  including derivative contracts that doral financial uses to manage its interest rate risk 
securities held for trading and derivatives are recorded at fair values with increases or decreases in such values reflected in current earnings 
the fair values of many of doral financial s trading securities other than ios and derivative instruments are based on dealer quotations from recognized markets and  as such  do not require significant management judgment 
for instruments not traded on a recognized market  doral financial generally determines fair value by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments 
as of december   doral financial held million in puerto rico tax exempt gnma securities included in its securities held for trading portfolio 
because of their preferential tax status in puerto rico  these securities cannot be valued directly by reference to market quotations for us gnma securities with similar characteristics 
doral financial determines the fair value of its portfolio of tax exempt gnma securities  based on a quotation received by a puerto rico broker dealer 
generally  derivatives are financial instruments with little or no initial net investment in comparison to their notional amount and whose value is based on the value of an underlying asset  index  reference rate or other variable 
they may be standardized contracts executed through organized exchanges or privately negotiated contractual agreements that can be customized to meet specific needs  including certain commitments to purchase and sell mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the fair value of derivatives is generally reported net by counterparty  provided that a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists 
derivatives in a net asset position are reported as part of securities held for trading  at fair value 
similarly  derivatives in a net liability position are reported as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities  at fair value 
derivatives used by the company in the ordinary course of business are not designated as being in hedge accounting relationships 
for those derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge  fair value gains and losses are reported as part of net gain loss on securities held for trading in the consolidated statements of income 
other income recognition policies interest income on loans is accrued by doral financial when earned 
loans are placed on a non accrual basis when any portion of principal or interest is more than days past due  or earlier if concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all accrued but unpaid interest to date is fully reversed 
such interest  if collected  is credited to income in the period of recovery 
loans return to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are anticipated to be fully collectible 

table of contents loan origination fees  as well as discount points and certain direct origination costs for mortgage loans held for sale  are initially recorded as an adjustment to the cost of the loan and reflected in doral financial s earnings as part of the net gain on mortgage loans sales and fees when the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security 
in the case of loans receivable held for investment  such fees and costs are deferred and amortized to income as adjustments to the yield of the loan in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
allowance for loan and lease losses doral financial maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb probable credit related losses on its loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance consists of specific and general components and is based on doral financial s assessment of default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risks inherent in the loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance is maintained at a level that doral financial considers to be adequate to absorb probable losses 
credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance  while increases to the allowance are charged to operations 
unanticipated increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses could adversely impact doral financial s net income in the future 
commercial and construction loans over million that are classified as substandard are evaluated individually for impairment 
the company evaluates impaired loans and related valuation allowance based on sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
doral financial measures impaired loans at their estimated realizable values determined by discounting the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  if practical  at the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
in assessing the reserves under the discounted cash flows  the company considers the estimate of future cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
all available evidence  including estimated costs to sell if those costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the loan  are considered in developing those estimates 
the likelihood of the possible outcomes is considered in determining the best estimate of expected future cash flows 
doral financial s mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of homogeneous loans that are secured by residential real estate and are made to consumers 
doral financial does not evaluate individual homogeneous loans for impairment 
instead  it records an allowance including residential mortgages  consumer  commercial and construction loans under million on an aggregate basis under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
for such loans  the allowance is determined considering the historical charge off experience of each loan category and delinquency levels and trends  as well as charge off and economic data  such as interest rate levels  inflation and the strength of the housing market in the areas where the company operates 
estimated recourse obligation from time to time  the company sells mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities subject to recourse provisions 
pursuant to these recourse arrangements  the company agrees to retain or share the credit risk with the purchaser of such mortgage loans for a specified period or up to a certain percentage of the total amount in loans sold 
the company estimates the fair value of the retained recourse obligation or any liability incurred at the time of sale and includes such obligation with the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in a lower gain on sale recognition 
doral financial recognizes the fair value of its recourse obligation by estimating the amount that the company would be required to pay for mortgage insurance from a third party in order to be relieved of its estimated recourse exposure on these loans 
the company believes that this method resulted in an adequate valuation of its recourse allowance as of december   but actual future recourse obligations may be different and a different result may have been obtained if the company had used another method for estimating this liability  such as one requiring management to estimate this liability based on actual historical losses incurred by the company 
as part of its new business strategy  the company is seeking to reduce the sale of mortgage loans with recourse 

table of contents income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on current tax laws 
to the extent tax laws change  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted  to the extent necessary  in the period that the tax change is enacted 
the company recognizes income tax benefits when the realization of such benefits is probable 
a valuation allowance is recognized for any deferred tax asset which  based on management s evaluation  is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the amount of the valuation allowance has been determined based on our estimates of taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
our methodology for determining the realizability of deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income for the company and of estimated operating expenses to support that anticipated level of business  as well as the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets 
income tax benefit or expense includes i deferred tax expense or benefit  which represents the net change in the deferred tax assets or liability balance during the year plus any change in the valuation allowance  if any  and ii current tax expense

compared to doral financial incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the results for reflect decreases in net interest income related primarily to the following factors a continued compression in the company s net interest margin  which resulted in a million  or  decrease in net interest income in compared to an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses as a result of increases in specific reserves related to the allowance for the company s construction loan portfolio  as well as a deterioration in the delinquency trends of the overall loan portfolio  particularly in the company s construction and commercial portfolios 
a reduction in non interest income attributable to i a million loss on io valuation principally related to losses suffered during the first half of from the impact of increases in short term interest rates on ios that did not have caps on the pass through interest payable to investors  ii a loss of approximately million related to a sale of investment securities designed to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk  and iii losses of million on mortgage loan sales and fees principally attributable to a market value adjustment of million taken during the year in connection with the transfer of certain mortgage loans from the held for sale category to loans receivable 
mortgage loan sales and fees were also adversely impacted by a net loss of approximately million incurred in connection with the restructuring of certain mortgage loan transfer transactions with local institutions 
an increase in non interest expense  principally related to i a contingency provision of million recorded in connection with an agreement to settle the company s consolidated securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation related to the restatement of prior period financial statements  ii increases in professional fees related to the resolution of ongoing legacy issues and the company s business transformation and recapitalization efforts  and iii severance payments associated with a reduction in headcount 
the decreases in interest income and in non interest income were offset in part by a tax benefit of million for  compared to a tax expense of million for such tax benefit results from the company s loss position and from agreements signed during with the puerto rico treasury department 
compared to doral financial s consolidated net income decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in consolidated net income was principally attributable to a decrease in net interest income coupled with increases in tax expense and non interest expenses  which were partially offset by an increase in non interest income 
the decrease in net interest income partially reflects a significant decrease in the company s net interest margin as a result of the flattening of the yield curve during the increase in non interest expenses was principally due to increases in professional services  driven by expenses associated with the restatement of the company s prior period financial statements and to a million reserve for the settlement of the sec s investigation of the company 
the increase in non interest income was principally driven by unrealized gains experienced with respect to derivative instruments undertaken for risk management purposes see risk management  below  for a description of doral financial s interest rate risk management policies and procedures  coupled with increases in net servicing income due to lower impairment charges resulting from a decrease in forecasted mortgage prepayment rates 
the increase in non interest income was 
table of contents partially offset by lower gains on sales of mortgage loans as a result of the company s inability to use its traditional secondary market channels to effect non conforming loan sales because of the uncertainty surrounding the restatement process and a significant loss on sale of investment securities 
for the year ended december   doral financial reported income tax expense of million representing an effective tax rate of  as compared to a tax benefit of million for during  the company s effective tax rate was adversely affected by an increase in income tax rates in puerto rico  net operating losses at certain subsidiaries that could not be used to offset taxable income at other subsidiaries and certain expenses that were not deductible for tax purposes 
net interest income net interest income is the excess of interest earned by doral financial on its interest earning assets over the interest incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
doral financial s net interest income is subject to interest rate risk due to the repricing and maturity mismatch in the company s assets and liabilities 
generally  doral financial s assets have a longer maturity and a later repricing date than its liabilities  which results in lower net interest income in periods of rising short term interest rates 
in particular  doral financial maintained a portfolio with a carrying value of approximately billion of fixed rate investment securities as of december  these securities were generally purchased as part of prior management s strategy of maximizing tax exempt income 
these securities were generally financed with callable repurchase agreements or short term borrowings 
as interest rates increase  lenders exercise their call right and the company is required to re price or replace this funding which adversely impacts its interest rate margin 
refer to risk management below for additional information on the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
net interest income for the years  and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
compared to doral financial s net interest income for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  compared to the decrease in net interest income was principally due to continued compression of the company s net interest spread and a reduction in the average balance of the company s interest earnings assets 
doral financial s net interest spread and margin for the year ended december  were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  the reduction in average earning assets reflects a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale as a result of sales during of approximately billion in mortgage loans as part of the restructuring of prior mortgage loan transfers that were recharacterized as secured borrowings as part of the restatement 
the decrease in average earning assets also reflects a decrease in the average balance of investment securities 
the company s current strategy is to gradually de emphasize investment securities from the company s balance sheet and retain more loans in its balance sheet 
this strategy is designed to reduce interest rate risk by reducing the gap between the repricing of its assets and its liabilities 
as part of this strategy  the company sold billion of lower yielding securities from its available for sale portfolio during the fourth quarter of and billion in available for sale securities during the fourth quarter of  of which million settled during the first quarter of the decrease in average earning assets also reflects the company s decision in august of to discontinue the practice of purchasing whole loans without the associated servicing rights for subsequent securitization into mortgage backed securities 
the decrease in net interest rate spread and margin for the year ended december   as compared with  was due primarily to increases in short term interest rates  at which liabilities re priced  that outpaced the increase in yield on interest earning assets 
the decrease in net interest rate spread was caused primarily by the following factors the higher cost of short term borrowings as a result of the federal reserve s tightening monetary policy  raising the federal funds target rate by basis points from october  to june   and leaving it at for the remainder of the compressed margin on the company s large portfolio of investment securities 
assuming a funding cost equal to the weighted average cost of the company s repurchase agreements  the average interest rate spread on the company s investment securities for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  
table of contents the decrease the current mismatch in the duration of the company s assets and liabilities 
this mismatch exposes the company to significant interest rate risk in a rising rate environment because  as these short term or callable liabilities re price at higher market rates  the company s interest rate margin is further compressed 
the company s interest rate exposure is further complicated by the negative convexity ie  the tendency for the average life of the company s assets to decrease through prepayments as interest rates decline inherent in the company s portfolio of fixed rate mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans 
the combination of this negative convexity and the current composition of the company s liabilities exposes the company to margin compression risks even in certain declining interest rate environments 
the decrease in interest income on ios  which was principally attributable to a significant decrease in the average principal balance of the mortgage loans underlying the outstanding ios as a result of the restructuring of certain mortgage loan sales during the first half of and  to a lesser extent  to increases in short term interest rates compared to increased deposits at doral financial s banking subsidiaries  including brokered deposits  coupled with a more competitive deposit environment  as well as increased costs of its repurchase agreements and notes payable 
the increase in cost of notes payable reflects the re pricing nature of most of the company s notes payable  which are floating rate notes indexed to month libor 
compared to doral financial s net interest income for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  compared to the decrease in net interest income was due to a significant reduction in the company s net interest margin offset in part by significant increases in doral financial s average balance of interest earning assets 
doral financial s net interest spread and margin for the year ended december  were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest rate spread and margin during was due primarily to the upward trend of short term interest rates and the flattening of the yield curve 
the average rate paid by doral financial on its interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points during  while the average yield earned on its interest earning assets decreased by nine basis points  compared to the decrease in the yield of the company s interest earning assets related primarily to lower yields obtained on loans originated during the period 
average interest earning assets grew by from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the increase in average interest earning assets  particularly in the loans portfolio and mortgage backed securities  was driven by a strong level of loan originations and the company s strategy to increase its interest income by investing in mortgage backed securities 
the increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities reflected the company s strategy to maximize tax exempt interest income by holding a significant amount of us gnmas and us fhlmc fnma mortgage backed securities at its international banking entity subsidiary 
under puerto rico law  the interest earned on such us mortgage backed securities is tax exempt for doral financial s international banking subsidiary 
the increase in the volume of interest earning assets was funded through a combination of deposits and secured borrowings including securities sold under repurchase agreements

net loss on the value of the company s ios for the period ended december  was million  compared to a net loss of million for higher losses during were recognized as a result of a basis point decrease in spread  due to a lower weighted average coupon on the underlying mortgage loans and higher implied libor rates

the value of the variable rate ios is very sensitive to changes in interest rates  particularly to changes in short term interest rates 
as short term interest rates increase  the value of the company s variable rate ios is adversely affected 
this may be offset  to some extent  by a reduction of prepayments and the extension of the asset s life 
conversely  as short term interest rates decrease  the fair value of the ios increases  but this may be partially or fully offset by an acceleration of prepayments and associated reduction of the life of the asset

as puerto rico corporations  doral financial and all of its puerto rico subsidiaries are generally required to pay federal income taxes only with respect to their income derived from the active conduct of a trade or business in the united states excluding puerto rico and certain investment income derived from us assets 
any such tax is creditable  with certain limitations  against puerto rico income taxes

doral financial also invests in us treasury and agency securities that are exempt from puerto rico taxation and are not subject to federal income taxation because of the portfolio interest deduction to which doral financial is entitled as a foreign corporation 
in addition  doral financial uses its international banking entity subsidiary to invest in various us securities and us mortgage backed securities  which interest income and gain on sale  if any  is exempt from puerto rico income taxation and excluded from federal income taxation on the basis of the portfolio interest deduction in the case of interest  and  in the case of capital gains  because the gains are sourced outside the united states 
under the pr code  the statutory corporate tax rates ranges from effective july  for capital gain transactions to a maximum of for regular income 
the pr code also includes an alternative minimum tax of that applies if the company s regular income tax liability is less than the alternative minimum tax requirements 
the provision for income taxes of the company differs from amounts computed by applying the applicable puerto rico statutory rate to income before taxes 
a reconciliation of the difference follows

the decrease in the tax provision for the year ended december  is principally due to pre tax losses recognized during  combined with an increase in the company s net deferred tax asset as a result of agreements entered into with the puerto rico treasury department  which are described below 
during  the company entered into two separate agreements with the puerto rico treasury department regarding the company s deferred tax asset related to prior intercompany transfers of ios the io tax asset 
the first agreement  executed during the first quarter  confirmed the previously established tax basis of all of the io transfers within the doral financial corporate group 
the second agreement  executed during the third quarter of  clarified that for puerto rico income tax purposes  the io tax asset is a stand alone intangible asset subject to a straight line amortization based on a useful life of years 
furthermore  the agreement provided that the io tax asset may be transferred to any entity within doral financial corporate group  including the puerto rico banking subsidiary 
the confirmation of the previously established tax basis of all io transfers within the doral financial corporate group and the ability to use the io tax asset in the company s profitable subsidiaries resulted in an increase in the deferred tax asset  net of the valuation allowance  and in a net tax benefit  for the year ended december  in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company considers the expected realization of its deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
in assessing such projections  the company did not consider the effects of the proposed transaction  as part of the plans to pay its million floating senior notes that mature on july   as detailed in note to the financial statements 
the effects that the proposed transaction would have on the projections would be considered after the conclusion of the transactions leading to the payment of the senior notes 
in the case of the io tax asset  the realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the existence of  or generation of  taxable income during the year period in which the amortization deduction is available 
in determining the valuation allowance recorded  the company considered both the positive and negative evidence regarding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
positive evidence included projected earnings attributable to the core business through the projection period 
further positive evidence included the ability to isolate nonrecurring charges in historical losses and that it is objectively verifiable that such charges will not recur  core earnings of the business absent these nonrecurring items and the flexibility to move io amortization to profitable entities according to our agreements with the puerto rico treasury department 
negative evidence included our recorded loss for the year ended december   the net operating loss short carry forward period of years and the uncertainties surrounding the company s ability to continue as a going concern dependent on the ability to secure the needed outside financing for the payment of the million floating senior notes that mature in july negative evidence also included the risks factors described in item a of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  in weighing the positive and negative evidence above  we considered the more likely than not criteria pursuant to sfas as well as the risk factors related to its future business described above 
based on this analysis we concluded that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million would be realized 
under the pr code  doral financial is not permitted to file consolidated tax returns and  thus  doral financial is not able to utilize losses from one subsidiary to offset gains in another subsidiary 
accordingly  in order to obtain a tax benefit from a net operating loss  a particular subsidiary must be able to demonstrate sufficient taxable income within the applicable carry forward period seven years under the pr code 
as of december   net operating losses of million were recognized at the subsidiary level that  based on the forecasted future taxable income  such subsidiaries could not utilize to offset future income 
this resulted in an increase of the valuation allowance 
at december   the deferred tax asset  net of its 
table of contents valuation allowance of million  amounted to approximately million  compared to million at december  failure to achieve sufficient projected taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax asset 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to increased competition  a decline in margins and loss of market share 
during  pre tax income from doral financial s international banking entity subsidiary amounted to million  compared to million for compared to for the year ended december   doral financial reported income tax expense of million representing an effective tax rate of  as compared to a tax benefit of million for during  the company s effective tax rate was adversely affected by an increase in income tax rates in puerto rico  net operating losses at certain subsidiaries that could not be used to offset taxable income at other subsidiaries and certain expenses that were not deductible for tax purposes 
these factors were offset  in part  by a high proportion of pre tax income represented by tax exempt income derived from doral financial s international banking entity subsidiary 
during  the company benefited from a significant inter company sale of ios completed for the purpose of taking advantage of a temporary reduction in capital gain tax rates  as well as from the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to taxes paid on transfers of ios based on their value prior to the restatement 
on august   legislation was enacted in puerto rico to provide a temporary reduction in the long term capital gain tax rates 
the law amended the pr code to reduce the long term capital gain tax rates by fifty percent for transactions occurring from july   through june  the maximum long term capital gain tax rate applicable to gains on sale of property located in puerto rico as defined in the pr code during this period was reduced to from for corporations and partnerships 
to take advantage of this reduction  during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of  the company entered into two separate agreements with the local taxing authorities related to intercompany sales of ios  which permitted the company to accelerate the recognition for tax purposes of long term capital gains of million and million  respectively  related to ios created in previous transactions 
the value of the ios at the time of the agreements  after making all relevant adjustments pursuant to the restatement  approximates million and million  respectively 
refer to note restatement of previously issued financial statements to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the company s amended annual report on form k for additional information 
the transactions executed during the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately million and million  respectively  representing the difference between the deferred tax liability originally accrued on the ios at the higher rate and the reduced long term capital gain rate of 
during  as a result of the correction in the methodology used to determine the fair value of its portfolio of ios and the recharacterization of certain mortgage loan transfers as secured borrowings  the company recognized a deferred tax asset and deferred benefit of million before any valuation allowance 
this benefit is attributable to the tax effect of the difference between the tax basis of the ios and their restated book value 
the basis differential arises from the fact that doral financial paid taxes on the book value of the ios prior to the restatement  as opposed to the restated value  which would have resulted in a significant lower tax obligation 
the company accounted for this tax benefit pursuant to the guidance in eitf  accounting for acquired temporary differences in certain purchase transactions that are not accounted for as business combinations 
as a result of the increase in deferred tax assets attributable to the restatement  the company has evaluated its ability to realize the deferred tax asset and concluded  based on the evidence available  that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  and  as a result  established a valuation allowance 
this evaluation included an analysis of the inability of the company to file consolidated tax returns for its puerto rico subsidiaries and  therefore  to utilize losses in one of its subsidiaries to offset gains in another subsidiary 
at december   the deferred tax asset  net of its valuation allowance of million  amounted to approximately million 
during  certain subsidiaries operated at a loss  and based on the forecast of future taxable income  doral financial determined that the associated deferred tax asset could not be realized 
specifically  for the year ended 
table of contents december   the company expected that the tax benefit of million attributable to losses at certain subsidiaries would not be realized and  as a result  it is not recognized in the financial statements 
during  all of doral financial s subsidiaries operated at a profit

expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because of prepayments and other market factors

table l loans receivable by contractual maturities as of december  year to over in thousands or less years years total construction loans residential mortgage loans commercial secured by real estate consumer other lease financing receivable commercial non real estate loans on savings deposits land secured loans receivable  gross scheduled contractual amortization of loans receivable does not reflect the expected life of doral financial s loans receivable portfolio 
the average life of these loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and  with respect to conventional mortgage loans  due on sale clauses  which give doral financial the right to declare a conventional mortgage loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when current mortgage loan rates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans 
under the latter circumstance  the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates 

table of contents the following table sets forth the dollar amount of total loans receivable at december   as shown in the preceding table  which have fixed interest rates or which have floating or adjustable interest rates that have a contractual maturity of more than one year

unlike its portfolio of residential mortgage loans  which is comprised almost entirely of fixed rate mortgage loans  a significant portion of doral financial s construction  land  and other commercial loans classified as loans receivable carry adjustable rates 
at december   and  approximately   and  respectively  of doral financial s gross loans receivable were adjustable rate loans 
the decrease in the percentage of adjustable rate loans is related to the reclassification during of million of loans from mortgage loans held for sale to loans receivable 
the adjustable rate construction  commercial and land loans have interest rate adjustment limitations and are generally tied to the prime rate  and often provide for a maximum and minimum rate beyond which the applicable interest rate will not fluctuate 
future market factors may affect the correlation of the interest rate adjustment with the rate doral financial pays on the different funding sources used to finance these loans 
substantially all construction  commercial and land loans held by doral financial are adjustable rate loans maturing  generally  within to months

the company evaluates for impairment its investment securities at least quarterly or earlier if other factors indicative of potential impairment exist 
an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of income is recognized when the decline in the fair value of the securities below their cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
the company evaluates for other than temporary impairment in accordance with fasb staff position fas the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which requires that the company consider various factors in determining whether it should recognize an impairment charge  including  but not limited to  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been below cost basis  the expectations for the security s performance  the creditworthiness of the issuer  and the company s intention and ability to hold the security until maturity 
the unrealized losses in the company s investment securities are almost entirely related to increases in interest rates  which tend to reduce the value of fixed rate securities  and are not related to credit concerns 
most of the company s securities are either us government agency or mortgage backed securities that are highly rated 
moreover  the company understands that it has adequate liquidity at its banking subsidiaries  where most of the securities are held  to continue to hold these securities 
based on these factors  management has concluded that the existing impairments as of december  were temporary and no impairment charge was reported in the consolidated statements of income

liquidity and capital resources doral financial has an ongoing need for capital to finance its lending  servicing and investing activities 
doral financial s cash requirements arise mainly from loan originations and purchases  purchases and holding of securities  repayments of debt upon maturity  payments of operating and interest expenses  servicing advances and loan repurchases pursuant to recourse or warranty obligations 
liquidity of the holding company doral financial s liquidity and capital position at the holding company differ from the liquidity and capital positions of the company s banking subsidiaries 
doral financial s banking subsidiaries rely primarily on deposits  
table of contents short term borrowings under fhlb advances and repurchase agreements secured by pledges of their mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities as their primary sources of liquidity 
these sources of liquidity for doral financial s banking subsidiaries have generally not been adversely impacted in material respects by the restatement of the company s consolidated financial statements or by the deterioration in the consolidated financial condition of the company 
on the other hand  the holding company s traditional sources of funding through repurchase agreements or the issuance of debt or equity instruments in the capital markets have been significantly disrupted because of the restatement and the deterioration in the consolidated financial condition of the company 
since the restatement  the holding company has had to rely primarily on loan servicing fees and sales of mortgage loans in the secondary markets to agencies or us financial institutions as its principal sources of liquidity 
the holding company also has two short term repurchase facilities with outstanding balances totaling approximately million 
these facilities are secured by whole loans and subordinated mortgage securities and may be terminated upon demand or short notice by the lender 
if these facilities are terminated  the holding company s financial position may be adversely affected 
the holding company s access to the liquidity at its banking subsidiaries is significantly restricted by statutory and regulatory restrictions 
the holding company s capital resources and financing costs have been adversely affected by a number of factors associated with the restatement process  including the downgrades of its credit ratings  its inability to access the capital markets  the decision of a substantial majority of its unsecured creditors not to renew committed credit facilities  the inability to sell non conforming mortgage loans in the local market  and reliance on sales in the us secondary markets  which have stricter underwriting requirements  legal  accounting and other professional expenses associated with the ongoing legacy and transformation process  which amounted to an average of million per month during  regulatory consent orders that  as from march   prohibit the company s banking subsidiaries from paying dividends to the holding company  without prior regulatory approval  and the settlement of the sec s investigation of the company  which required the payment of a million civil penalty in february in addition  the liquidity of the holding company has been adversely affected by an increased demand for loan repurchases pursuant to recourse or representation and warranty obligations 
during  the company repurchased approximately million in mortgage loans pursuant to existing recourse obligations 
the company also was required to substitute collateral of approximately million in mortgage loans under a secured commercial facility for failure to meet collateral eligibility requirements 
in addition  certain institutions have approached the company alleging violations of representations and warranties relating to documentation issues primarily loan file deficiencies involving mortgage loans sold to these institutions 
doral financial is working with these financial institutions to review the claims and to correct alleged documentation deficiencies  which relate primarily to loan file deficiencies 
while the parties are currently cooperating with each other and doral financial will seek to minimize required repurchases  if any  by correcting flaws  no assurance can be given that any required repurchase will not adversely affect the company s liquidity 
as a result of the liquidity pressures facing the holding company  fnma and other parties could take steps to terminate their business of contractual relationship with the company  including the termination of mortgage servicing agreements  which would have a material adverse effect on the holding company s liquidity and on its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate its business 
see item a 
risk factors  risks relating to the holding company s deteriorated financial condition doral financial s deteriorated earnings have resulted in a reduction of doral financial s capital position and  together with the pending debt maturity and downgrades to its credit ratings  have adversely affected its operations and the ability to the holding company to access funding  in this annual report on form k 
in connection with its efforts to facilitate the necessary investments required to satisfy the company s capital and liquidity needs  the company engaged in discussions with the lead plaintiff in the consolidated securities class 
table of contents action lawsuits pending against doral financial 
on april   doral financial entered into an agreement to settle all claims in the consolidated securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation filed against the company following the announcement in april of the need to restate its financial statements for the period of to the settlement is subject to notice and approval from the us district court for the southern district of new york 
under the terms of the settlement agreement and a concurrent agreement entered into by insurers to the company and its current and former directors and officers  the company and insurers will pay an aggregate of million  of which insurers will pay approximately million 
in addition  one or more individual defendants will pay an aggregate of million in cash or doral financial stock 
the company s payment obligations under the settlement agreement are subject to the closing and funding of one or more transactions through which the company obtains outside financing during to meet its liquidity and capital needs  including the repayment of the company s million senior notes due on july   payment of the amounts due under the settlement agreement and certain other working capital and contractual needs 
either side may terminate the settlement agreement if the company has not raised the necessary funding by september  or if the settlement has not been fully funded within days from the receipt of such funding 
on april   doral financial announced that  as a prudent capital management decision designed to preserve and strengthen the company s capital  the board of directors voted to suspend the quarterly dividend on the company s common stock 
the holding company has continued to pay dividends on its preferred stock  and the company continues to pay its debts as they become due 
recapitalization of the holding company doral financial will need significant outside financing during  principally for the payment of its million floating rate senior notes that mature on july  and of amounts required under the settlement agreement dated april  in respect of the consolidated securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation brought against the company following the announcement of the restatement of its financial statements in the company currently estimates that these external funding needs for will range between approximately million and million without considering the distribution of any proceeds from the sale of doral bank ny s branches 
the company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report have been prepared assuming doral financial will continue as a going concern 
in light of the holding company s liquidity needs and the risks and uncertainties surrounding its recapitalization process  the holding company s liquidity position raises substantial doubts about the holding company s ability to continue operating as a going concern without such recapitalization 
doral financial is in active negotiations with a private equity firm the lead sponsor regarding a substantial investment in the company by a new bank holding company 
the new holding company would be capitalized by a number of private equity and other sophisticated financial investors  and their investment would take into account the various ownership restrictions imposed by banking regulations 
the lead sponsor is actively engaged in discussions with a number of potential investors to raise the contemplated capital for the new holding company to invest in doral 
based on its discussions to date  the company believes that the proposed transaction  if executed  would be accomplished predominantly through the issuance of new equity securities at a discount to market price and would result in very significant dilution to the company s existing shareholders 
if the company is successful in entering into the proposed transaction and it is consummated on a timely basis  the company believes that the proposed transaction would adequately satisfy its capital and liquidity needs 
however  the company cannot provide assurances that it will ultimately be able to enter into an agreement with respect to the proposed transaction 
the proposed transaction would be subject to various conditions precedent  including but not limited to the receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals  the receipt of sufficient equity commitments from other investors  final district court approval of the settlement agreement in respect of the consolidated securities class action and shareholder derivative claims brought against the company  the absence of certain adverse developments and other customary closing conditions 

table of contents although the company would attempt to enter into an alternative transaction that would provide it with the liquidity and capital needed to continue its business in the event that it is unable to enter into the proposed transaction  the company cannot provide assurance that it would succeed in entering into such a transaction  especially in the limited time available prior to the july  maturity of the senior notes 
the failure to refinance the senior notes and recapitalize the holding company would have a material adverse effect on  and impair  the holding company s financial condition and ability to operate as going concern

uses of cash servicing agreements relating to the mortgage backed securities programs of fnma  fhlmc and gnma  and to mortgage loans sold to certain other investors  require doral financial to advance funds to make scheduled payments of principal  interest  taxes and insurance  if such payments have not been received from the borrowers 
while doral financial generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements within days  it must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
during  the monthly average amount of funds advanced by doral financial under such servicing agreements was approximately million  compared to million for the decrease during was mainly related to the previously reported restructuring of various loan transfer transactions with local financial institutions during the second quarter of and new terms with respect to remittance schedules 
to the extent the mortgage loans underlying doral financial s servicing portfolio experience increased delinquencies  doral financial would be required to dedicate additional cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts 
in recent years  doral financial has sold pools of delinquent fha and va and conventional mortgage loans 
under these arrangements  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while doral financial expects to recover the amounts advanced through foreclosure or  in the case of fha va loans  under the applicable fha and va insurance and guarantee programs  the amounts advanced tend to be greater than normal arrangements because of the delinquent status of the loans 
as of december  and  the outstanding principal balance of such delinquent loans was million and million  respectively  and the aggregate monthly amount of funds advanced by doral financial was million and million  respectively 
when doral financial sells mortgage loans to third parties it generally makes customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics  investors are generally entitled to cause doral financial to repurchase such loans 
during  doral financial experienced increased demands for repurchase associated with documentation and compliance issues 
to the extent this trend continues  it would place increased demands on the company s liquidity 
in addition to its servicing and warranty obligations  in the past doral financial s loan sale activities have included the sale of non conforming mortgage loans subject to recourse arrangements that generally require doral financial to repurchase or substitute the loans if the loans are days or more past due or otherwise in default up to a specified amount or limited to a period of time after the sale 
to the extent the delinquency ratios of the loans sold subject to recourse are greater than anticipated and doral financial is required to repurchase more loans than anticipated  doral financial s liquidity requirements would increase 
see off balance sheet activities below for additional information on these arrangements 
from time to time  doral financial also sells or securitizes mortgage loans with fnma on a partial or full recourse basis 
doral financial s contractual agreements with fnma authorize fnma to require doral financial to post collateral in the form of cash or marketable securities to secure such recourse obligation to the extent doral financial does not maintain an investment grade rating 
as of december   doral financial s maximum recourse exposure with fnma amounted to million and fnma required the posting of approximately million in cash collateral to secure recourse obligations 
while deemed unlikely by doral financial  fnma has the contractual right to request collateral for the full amount of doral financial s recourse obligations 
any such request by fnma would have a material adverse effect on doral financial s liquidity and business

under doral financial s repurchase lines of credit and derivative contracts  doral financial is required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements 
to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of changes in interest rates  doral financial will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements  thereby adversely affecting its liquidity 
a considerable amount of doral financial s liquidity is derived from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market 
the us including puerto rico secondary mortgage market is the most liquid in the world in large part because of the sale or guarantee programs maintained by fha  va  hud  fnma and fhlmc 
to the extent these programs are curtailed or the standard for insuring or selling loans under such programs is materially increased  or  for any reason  doral financial were to fail to qualify for such programs  doral financial s ability to sell mortgage loans and consequently its liquidity would be materially adversely affected 
doral financial s banking subsidiaries obtain funding for their lending activities through the receipt of deposits  through advances from the fhlb and from other borrowings  such as term notes backed by federal home loan bank of new york fhlb ny letters of credit

brokered deposits are used by doral financial s banking subsidiaries as a source of long term funds 
brokered deposits  however  are generally considered a less stable source of funding than core deposits obtained through retail bank branches 
brokered deposit investors are generally very sensitive to interest rates and will generally move funds from one depository institution to another based on minor differences in rates offered on deposits

doral financial s regulatory capital ratios as of december  declined  when compared to  due to the decrease in the company s capital driven by the net loss of million experienced during the impact of the loss on the company s capital ratios was partially offset by a decrease in the volume of risk weighted assets 
the lower volume of risk weighted assets during  which decreased by compared to  was principally attributable to significant decreases in the company s loan portfolios  in particular the commercial and residential loan portfolios as a result of the restructuring of the company s previous transfer of residential and commercial mortgage loans to local financial institutions  coupled with a decrease of its investment securities portfolio  as part of the company s de leveraging strategies  resulting from the sale of approximately billion of the company s securities available for sales  of which million settled during the first quarter of as of december   doral bank pr and doral bank ny were considered well capitalized banks for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the fdic pursuant to the fdicia 
as a result of the losses incurred during  doral financial s leverage ratio fell below the minimum threshold for the holding company to classify as well capitalized 
to be considered a well capitalized institution under the fdic s regulations  an institution must maintain a leverage ratio of at least  a tier capital ratio of at least and a total capital ratio of at least  and not be subject to any written agreement or directive to meet a specific capital ratio 
failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements could result in the initiation of certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by banking regulators against doral financial and its banking subsidiaries that  if undertaken  could have a material adverse effect on doral financial

while the tier and total capital ratios have risk weighting components that take into account the low level of risk associated with the company s mortgage and securities portfolios  the leverage ratio is significantly lower because it is based on total average assets without any risk weighting

as of december   doral financial s banking subsidiaries had billion in assets  including assets of doral international  an international banking entity and wholly owned subsidiary of doral bank pr  compared to billion at december  the decrease in assets was principally due to the de leveraging of the banking subsidiaries investment portfolio by selling a significant amount of investment securities during the fourth quarter of and not reinvesting the proceeds of investments at maturity or repayment

doral financial is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments may include commitments to extend credit and sell mortgage backed securities and loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position 
the contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the company has in particular classes of financial instruments 
the company s exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit or for forward sales is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments

interest rate risk also includes the risk that doral financial s net interest income from its loan and investment portfolio will change in response to changes in interest rates 
doral financial s risk management policies are designed with the goal of maximizing long term shareholder value and minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility 
these policies are also designed to ensure the maintenance of adequate capitalization  liquidity  and other regulatory requirements 
the objectives of doral financial s risk management policies are pursued within the limits established by the board of directors of the company 
the board of directors has delegated the monitoring of interest rate and market risk to its risk policy committee 
doral financial s asset liability management committee alco has been created under the authority of the board of directors to manage the company s interest rate and market risk 
the alco is primarily responsible for ensuring that doral financial operates within the company s established asset liability management policy guidelines and procedures 
the alco reports directly to the risk policy committee of the board of directors 
the alco is responsible for developing the company s asset liability management and liquidity strategy  recommending for board approval asset liability and liquidity risk limits that are consistent with the company s policies  overseeing product pricing and volume objectives for customer related activities  overseeing the company s secondary sales activities  monitoring compliance with risk limits and judging adequacy of the execution of tactics by the funds management group  and overseeing the maintenance of management information systems that supply  on a timely basis  the information and data necessary for the alco to fulfill its role as the company s asset liability manager 
risk identification and measurement doral financial manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis 
changes in interest rates can affect the volume of doral financial s mortgage loan originations  the net interest income earned on doral financial s portfolio of loans and securities  the amount of gain on the sale of loans and the value of doral financial s servicing assets  ios  and loans and securities holdings 
as part of its interest rate risk management practices  doral financial has implemented measures to better identify the interest rate risk associated with the company s assets and liabilities and sources of income  and has developed policies and procedures to better manage these risks 
doral financial continues to explore ways to improve its interest rate risk management practices 
the company currently manages its interest rate risk by principally focusing on the following metrics net interest income sensitivity 
in determining the appropriate measure of doral financial s exposure to net interest income sensitivity  the company uses simulations to measure the risk of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income 
these simulations assume a static balance sheet  in which every maturing asset or liability is reinvested or refunded in the same type of instrument with the same tenor 
simulation modeling includes what if analyses to determine the 
table of contents effect of different interest scenarios on doral financial s risk profile and profitability 
the primary scenario used for risk measurement purposes is based on instantaneous changes in interest rates across contractual maturities 
in using these simulations  the company considers the impact of changes in interest rates on the interest rate spreads between deposits  cd rates  loans and investments  among others 
the impact of prepayment rates on loans and mortgage securities  interest rate caps and floors  and other options are also taken into account 
market value of equity 
while simulations can adequately assess short term years interest rate risk  doral financial does not rely entirely on this tool to capture and identify the risks associated with longer term re pricing imbalances 
to complement and broaden the risk analysis  the company uses duration and convexity analysis to measure the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
duration measures the linear change in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates  while  convexity measures the non linear change in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates 
the analysis of duration and convexity combined provide a better understanding of the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
leverage 
the company measures and monitors the company s leverage by targeting and setting limits to the following two ratios tangible equity to tangible assets  and risk based capital ratio 
yield curve twist 
under a normal yield curve  longer term interest rates are higher than shorter term rates 
a change of interest rates by the same amount along all maturities of the curve is called a parallel shift in the yield curve  since the shape of the curve stays the same  even though rates might be higher or lower across the curve 
a change in the yield curve where interest rates change differently for different terms of the curve is called a twist 
yield curve twist  also called rotation risk or yield curve risk  is the risk associated with non parallel rate shifts in the yield curve 
these changes in the shape of the yield curve are more commonly known as flattening or steepening 
the company measures market value of equity sensitivity to yield curve twist by shifting the month libor and year libor rates by and basis points  respectively  in opposite directions 
libor rate shifts between the month libor and year libor are interpolated in a linear fashion 
interest rate risk management strategy prior to the second half of  the company s interest rate risk strategy was designed to protect the value of the company s assets and income from instantaneous substantial increases in long term rates that could not be absorbed in the normal course of business and was not adequately aligned to the sensitivity of the company s balance sheet composition to interest rate changes 
in implementing this strategy the company entered into a substantial volume of short term derivatives transactions 
at december   based on the previous risk management strategy  the company had outstanding open derivative positions of billion 
doral financial s current interest rate management strategy is implemented by the alco and is designed to reduce the volatility of the company s net interest income and to protect the market value of equity 
while the current strategy will also use a combination of derivatives and balance sheet management  more emphasis is being placed on balance sheet management 
at december   under the company s new risk management strategy  the company s outstanding open derivative positions had decreased to billion 
net interest income risk 
in order to protect net interest income against interest rate risk  the alco employs a number of strategies  which are adjusted in relation to prevailing market conditions 
internal balance sheet management practices are designed to reduce the re pricing gaps of the company s assets and liabilities 
these techniques seek longer term funds through the use of long term repurchase agreements  fhlb ny advances and brokered deposits 

table of contents currently  the company mainly uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management activities 
interest rate swaps represent a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party pays fixed rate and the other pays a floating rate 
for net interest income protection  doral financial typically pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a floating rate of interest 
market value of equity hedging strategies 
due to the composition of doral financial s assets and liabilities  the company has a positive duration gap ie  on average the maturity of the company s assets is greater than the maturity of its liabilities which causes the market value of equity to decrease with increases in interest rates 
management uses duration and convexity strategies with the goal of bringing the company s duration gap within the long term targets established by the board of directors of the company 
duration risk 
in order to bring duration measures within the long term target of the company  management may use a combination of internal liabilities management techniques and derivative instruments 
doral financial primarily uses the following derivatives for such purposes interest rate swaps payor swaptions eurodollar futures treasury futures doral financial also enters into forward commitments to sell mortgage backed securities by setting the price in advance to protect the company against increases in interest rates and concurrent reductions in the price of mortgage backed securities 
convexity risk 
convexity is a measure of how much duration changes as interest rates change 
for doral financial  convexity risk primarily results from mortgage prepayment risk 
in order to bring convexity measures within the long term targets of the company  management primarily uses a combination of internal balance sheet management and the following derivatives payor swaptions call and put options on eurodollar futures put and call options on agency mortgage backed securities put and call options on treasury futures call options represent the right to buy a specified security at a specified price in the future 
their value generally increases as interest rates fall 
put options represent the right to sell a specified security in the future 
their value generally increases as interest rates rise 
these instruments enable the company to hedge against adverse changes in market value of equity due to unexpected movements in interest rates  taking into consideration the duration and interest rate sensitivity of the company s loan and investment portfolio 
doral financial s risk profile doral financial s goal is to manage market and interest rate risk within targeted levels 
the company s management seeks to modify the risk profile of the balance sheet through hedging activities to achieve targeted levels 
the interest rate risk exposure can be segregated into linear and non linear risk components based on the varying changes to the market value of equity due to changes in interest rates 
the linear risk is managed through interest rate swaps 
the non linear risk arises primarily from embedded optionality in our products and transactions which allows clients and counterparties to modify the maturity of loans  securities  deposits and or borrowings 
examples of non linear risks include the ability of a mortgagee to prepay his her mortgage or a counterparty exercising its puttable option on a structured transaction 
the embedded optionality is primarily managed by purchasing or selling options or by other active risk management strategies involving the use of derivatives  including the forward sale of mortgage backed securities 

table of contents the tables below show the risk profile of doral financial under basis point parallel and instantaneous increases and decreases of interest rates  as of december  and market value net interest as of december  of equity risk income risk bps bps market value net interest as of december  of equity risk income risk bps bps based on a month forward change in net interest income 
the decrease in net interest income risk as of december   compared to december   primarily relates to the restructuring of previous transfers of residential and commercial mortgage loans to local financial institutions and the sale of billion in investment securities during the fourth quarter of  of which million settled during the first quarter of the assets were long term fixed assets that were funded with short term variable liabilities  creating interest income risk 
the increase in market value of equity risk from december  to december  primarily relates to increases in long term interest rates during the first half of during the first half of  as interest rates increased  the duration of the company s mortgage related assets also increased 
however  this increase was not offset by a proportional increase in value of the company s instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes 
in addition  the duration of the company s structured borrowings  comprised of fhlb advances and repurchase agreements  decreased due to the fact that many of these instruments have call options in favor of the lender requiring doral financial to prepay the borrowing at the lender s option 
in a rising rate environment  as lenders exercise their call rights  doral financial is required to replace lower cost funding with higher cost funding 
the increase in the duration of the assets coupled with the decrease in duration of liabilities led to an increase in the duration of equity  which in turn led to higher sensitivity and higher market value of equity risk 
the following table shows the company s investment portfolio sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the table below assumes parallel and instantaneous increases and decreases of interest rates as of december  and december  in thousands as of december  as of december  change in fair change in change in fair change in value of fair value of value of fair value of available for held to available for held to change in yield sale securities maturity sale securities maturity curve basis points and fhlb stock securities and fhlb stock securities base doral financial s balance sheet includes a large portfolio of long term investment securities with fixed interest rates  mostly mortgage backed and us treasury securities 
these securities were purchased as part of prior management s strategy to maximize tax exempt income 
the investment portfolio was mostly financed with short 
table of contents term or callable liabilities 
in a steep yield curve environment  the strategy increased net interest income but exposed the company to higher interest rate risk from increasing rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
because of the current composition of doral financial s assets and liabilities  the company believes that its net interest margin over a year horizon would compress in certain rising or declining interest rate environments  assuming parallel and instantaneous increases or decreases of interest rates 
under certain rising interest rate scenarios  the duration of the company s fixed rate mortgage loans and securities would extend and the company would be locked into lower yielding assets for longer periods 
at the same time  due to the callable features of the company s liabilities  the duration of the company s callable liabilities would shorten and the company would have to refinance its liabilities at higher rates 
under certain declining interest rate scenarios  the duration of the company s fixed rate mortgage loans and securities would shorten as mortgage refinancings increased this tendency is referred to as negative convexity and the company would have to reinvest principal prepayments at lower rates 
conversely  the duration of the company s callable liabilities would extend  as lenders would not exercise such options  and the company would be locked into higher borrowing rates 
the company  with the help of financial advisers  is examining alternatives to restructure its balance sheet in order to enhance the company s future earnings potential and to reduce the high level of interest risk and volatility inherent in its balance sheet 
the company sold billion in investment securities during the fourth quarter of as part of its efforts to reduce its interest rate risk  of which million settled during the first quarter of derivatives 
as described above  doral financial uses derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate risk caused by changes in interest rates 
derivatives are generally either privately negotiated over the counter otc contracts or standard contracts transacted through regulated exchanges 
otc contracts generally consist of swaps  caps and collars  forwards and options 
exchange traded derivatives include futures and options 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure 
interest rate swap agreements generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal 
non performance by the counterparty exposes doral financial to interest rate risk

table of contents operations as part of net gain loss on securities held for trading as they occur 
contracts with positive fair values are recorded as assets and contracts with negative fair values as liabilities  after the application of netting arrangements 
fair values of derivatives such as interest rate futures contracts or options are determined by reference to market prices 
fair values for derivatives purchased in the over the counter market are determined by prices provided by external sources or valuation models 
the notional amounts of derivatives totaled billion and billion  respectively  as of december  and notional amounts indicate the volume of derivatives activity  but do not represent doral financial s exposure to market or credit risk 
historically  the high volume of derivatives used by doral financial was associated with the company s economic hedging strategy 
doral financial s current risk management strategy is more focused on internal balance sheet management and the use of interest rate swaps for interest rate risk management purposes 
the increased focus on internal balance sheet management has resulted in a smaller volume of derivatives 
doral financial s ability to use derivatives in the future  however  could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the downgrades of it credit ratings 
as a result of the ratings downgrades affecting doral financial  counterparties to derivatives contracts used for interest rate risk management purposes could increase the applicable margin requirements under such contracts 
see item a  risk factors  risks relating to the holding company s deteriorated financial condition doral financial s deteriorated earnings have resulted in a reduction of doral financial s capital position and  together with the pending debt maturity and downgrades to its credit ratings  have adversely affected its operations and the ability of the holding company to access funding in this form k

the market risk of derivatives arises principally from the potential for changes in the value of derivative contracts based on changes in interest rates 
doral financial generally manages its risks by taking risk offsetting positions 
the credit risk of derivatives arises from the potential of counterparties to default on their contractual obligations 
to manage this credit risk  doral financial deals with counterparties of good credit standing  enters into master netting agreements whenever possible and  when appropriate  obtains collateral 
master netting agreements incorporate rights of set off that provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default 
the credit risk associated with futures contracts is also limited due to daily cash settlement of the net change in the value of open contracts with the exchange on which the contract is traded

exchange traded contracts do not measurably increase our exposure to counterparty credit risk because changes in value of exchange traded contracts are settled daily through a financial clearinghouse established by each exchange 
credit risk doral financial is subject to credit risk with respect to its portfolio of loans receivable 
loans receivable are loans that doral financial holds for investment and  therefore  doral financial is at risk for the term of the loans 
loans secured by income producing residential and commercial properties involve greater credit risk because they are larger in size and more risk is concentrated in a single borrower 
the properties securing these loans are also more difficult to dispose in foreclosure 
with respect to mortgage loans originated for sale as part of its mortgage banking business  doral financial is generally at risk for any mortgage loan default from the time it originates the mortgage loan until the time it sells the loan or packages it into a mortgage backed security 
with respect to fha loans  doral financial is fully insured as to principal by the fha against foreclosure loss 
va loans are guaranteed within a range of to of the principal amount of the loan subject to a maximum  ranging from  to  in addition to the mortgage collateral 
loan to value ratios for residential mortgage loans  excluding fha va loans  generally do not exceed for certain qualifying home purchase transactions  unless private mortgage insurance is obtained 
in the ordinary course of business  prior to  the company sold loans on a recourse basis 
when the company sells a loan with recourse  it commits  if the loan defaults  to make payments to remedy the default or to repurchase the defaulted loan 
see off balance sheet activities above for more information regarding recourse 
table of contents obligations 
the company has generally discontinued the practice of selling mortgage loans with recourse  except for recourse related to early payment defaults 
in connection with the transformation of doral financial s business strategies  the company s current management determined that doral financial s underwriting procedures and controls were not sufficiently robust or effective to enable the company to readily sell non conforming loans in the us institutional secondary mortgage market and were not consistent with the company s goals of retaining a greater portion of loan production and improving the quality of its loan portfolio 
accordingly  doral financial s current management  with the assistance of outside experts  is implementing a number of changes in the company s loan application and underwriting standards and controls 
doral financial has adopted a number of changes to its underwriting procedures designed to achieve uniform  automated and rules based underwriting standards  as well as to take into consideration worsening macroeconomic conditions in puerto rico 
the implementation of these standards contributed to a significant reduction in the company s loan originations 
the company believes that these changes will allow it to more efficiently underwrite assets with better credit quality and more appropriately price its loan products in the future 
because most of doral financial s loans are made to borrowers located in puerto rico and secured by properties located in puerto rico  doral financial is subject to credit risks tied to adverse economic  political or business developments and natural hazards  such as hurricanes  that may affect puerto rico 
for example  if puerto rico s real estate market were to experience an overall decline in property values  the company s rates of loss on foreclosure would probably increase 
during and the first quarter of  a number of key economic indicators suggest that the puerto rico economy is suffering a slowdown  as a result of  among other things  high levels of oil prices  the upward trend in short term interest rates and the flattening of the yield curve  the depreciation of the dollar and the deceleration of public investment due to the commonwealth s current fiscal situation 
in particular  the increase in short term rates and the reduction in public investment have had an adverse effect on construction activity  which has been a key contributor to economic growth in recent years 
doral financial will continue to monitor the impact of macro economic conditions in puerto rico on its loan portfolio when assessing the adequacy of its provision for loan and lease losses 
doral financial also provides land acquisition  development  and construction financing to developers for residential housing projects 
construction loans extended to developers are typically adjustable rate loans  indexed to the prime interest rate with terms ranging generally from to months 
doral financial principally targets developers of residential construction for single family primary home occupancy 
during the year ended december   doral financial entered into million of commitments to disburse construction loans  compared to million for the following table presents further information on the company s construction portfolio 

table of contents in thousands as of december construction loans total undisbursed funds under existing commitments non performing construction loans net charge offs construction loans allowance for loan losses construction loans non performing construction loans to total construction loans allowance for loan losses construction loans to total construction loans net charge offs to total construction loans includes million and million of construction loans for residential housing projects as of december  and  respectively 
also includes million and million of construction loans for commercial  condominiums and multi family projects as of december  and  respectively 
non performing assets and allowance for loan and lease losses non performing assets consist of loans on a non accrual basis and other real estate owned 
loans are placed on a non accrual basis after they are delinquent for more than days 
when the loan is placed on non accrual  all accrued but unpaid interest to date is reversed 
such interest  if collected  is credited to income in the period of the recovery  and the loan returns to accrual when the principal and interest income become current and collectibility is reasonable assured 
as of december   and  doral financial would have recognized million  million and million  respectively  in additional interest income had all delinquent loans been accounted for on an accrual basis 
for the year ended december   the company reversed interest income amounting to million for certain substandard construction loans that were not yet delinquent for more than days due to concerns as to collectibility of the loans 
the company experienced an increase in non performing commercial and construction loans due to the overall deterioration of economic conditions in puerto rico  the slowdown in construction permits issued by the government of puerto rico and an overall deterioration in the housing market 
even though the majority of these loans are collateralized by real estate  such macro economic factors have contributed to increased delinquencies in both the construction and commercial portfolios 
the company evaluates impaired loans and the related valuation allowance based on sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
commercial and construction loans over million that are classified as substandard ratings are evaluated individually for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the borrower will not be able to fulfill its obligation according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
during the year ended december   doral financial evaluated a total of approximately million construction and commercial loans for impairment for which there are specific allowances amounting to approximately million 
doral financial records an allowance for small balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages  consumer  commercial and construction loans under million on a group basis under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
for such loans  the allowance is determined considering the historical charge off experience of each loan category and delinquency levels as well as charge off and delinquency trends and economic data  such as interest rate levels  inflation and the strength of the housing market in the areas where the company operates

also excludes million  of days past due fha va loans as of december  respectively  which were not considered non performing assets by doral financial because the principal balance of these loans is insured or guaranteed under applicable fha and va programs and interest is  in most cases  fully recovered in foreclosure proceedings 
under the new estimates  which were modified during the first quarter of  all fha va loans days past due are placed in non accrual and therefore considered non performing assets 
during the first quarter of  the company changed its estimates for non accrual loans as a result of conforming the non accrual policies of its mortgage banking units to that of its banking subsidiaries  pursuant to which mortgage loans held for sale are placed on a non accrual basis after they are delinquent for more than days 
prior to  mortgage loans held for sale by doral financial s mortgage banking units were placed on a non accrual status if they had been delinquent for more than days to the extent that the loan to value ratio indicated concern as to the collectibility of the loan

as of december  total non performing loans exclude million on certain construction loans  classified as substandard loans and placed on a non accrual status  but not more than days in arrears 
the proportion of the allowance for loan losses allocated to the residential mortgage loans portfolio historically has been lower than in other lending portfolios 
a substantial part of the amounts due on delinquent residential mortgage loans has been historically recovered through sale of the property after foreclosure or negotiated settlements with borrowers 
for purposes of comparability with the industry  the ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses to total non performing loans excludes the allowance allocated to residential mortgage loans from the numerator and the total residential mortgage loans portfolio and other non performing loans held for sale from the denominator

for  the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses reflects principally the increased risk profile of the company s construction and commercial loan portfolios reflected by the increase in delinquencies and the deterioration in asset classification 
to a lesser extent  the increase in the allowance was due to increased delinquencies in the company s residential loan portfolio

as of december   non residential mortgage loans composed of the total gross loan portfolio  compared to and for and  respectively 
the percentage of the allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans will not remain constant due to the nature of doral financial s portfolio of loans  which are primarily collateralized by real estate 
the collateral for each non performing mortgage loan is analyzed to determine potential loss exposure  and  in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
on an ongoing basis  management monitors the loan portfolio and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance  management considers such factors as default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risk inherent in the loan portfolios 
the company evaluates homogeneous loan portfolios  including residential mortgage loans  consumer loans and commercial and construction loans under million  for general valuation allowances by reference to historical charge off experiences of each loan category and delinquency levels as well as charge offs and delinquency trends and economic data  such as interest rate levels  inflation and the strength of the housing market in the areas where the company operates

loans deemed by management to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to expenses and credited to the allowance in amounts deemed appropriate by management based upon its evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
while management believes that the current allowance for loan and lease losses is sufficient  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions change substantially from the expectations used by doral financial in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses 
operational risk operational risks include the potential for financial losses resulting from failed or inadequate controls 
operational risks are inherent in every aspect of business operations  and can result from a range of factors including human judgments  process or system failures  or business interruptions 
operational risks are present in all of doral financial s business processes  including financial reporting 
overview of operational risk management doral financial is in the process of instituting an operational risk management program which will encompass the use of a more structured approach for the identification  assessment  measurement  mitigation  monitoring and reporting of events that may have an impact on doral financial s exposure to operational risk 
the proposed framework defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  systems  or from external events 
doral financial intends to retain a corporate level enterprise risk officer  who will be responsible for the analysis of non credit and non market risks faced by the company 
the enterprise risk officer will coordinate with the company sinternal audit group on risk identification and monitoring throughout doral financial 
in addition  the internal audit function will provide support to ensure compliance with doral financial s system of policies and controls and to ensure that adequate attention is given to correct issues identified

liquidity risk for a discussion of the risks associated with doral financial s ongoing need for capital to finance its lending  servicing and investing activities  please refer to liquidity and capital resources above 
doral financial will need significant outside financing during  principally for the payment of its million floating rate senior notes that mature on july  and of amounts required under the settlement agreement dated april  in respect of the consolidated securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation filed against the company following the announcement of the restatement of its financial statements in the company currently estimates that these external funding needs for will range between approximately million and million without considering the distribution of any proceeds from the sale of doral bank ny s branches 

table of contents doral financial is in active negotiations with a private equity firm the lead sponsor regarding a substantial investment in the company by a new bank holding company 
the new holding company would be capitalized by a number of private equity and other sophisticated financial investors  and their investment would take into account the various ownership restrictions imposed by banking regulations 
the lead sponsor is actively engaged in discussions with a number of potential investors to raise the contemplated capital for the new holding company to invest in doral 
based on its discussions to date  the company believes that the proposed transaction  if executed  would be accomplished predominantly through the issuance of new equity securities at a discount to market price and would result in very significant dilution to the company s existing shareholders 
if the company is successful in entering into the proposed transaction and it is consummated on a timely basis  the company believes that the proposed transaction would adequately satisfy its capital and liquidity needs 
however  the company cannot provide assurances that it will ultimately be able to enter into an agreement with respect to the proposed transaction 
the proposed transaction would be subject to various conditions precedent  including but not limited to the receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals  the receipt of sufficient equity commitments from other investors  final district court approval of the settlement agreement in respect of the consolidated securities class action and shareholder derivative claims brought against the company  the absence of certain adverse developments and other customary closing conditions 
although the company would attempt to enter into an alternative transaction that would provide it with the liquidity and capital needed to continue its business in the event that it is unable to enter into the proposed transaction  the company cannot provide assurance that it would succeed in entering into such a transaction  especially in the limited time available prior to the july  maturity of the senior notes 
the failure to refinance the senior notes and recapitalize the holding company would have a material adverse effect on  and impair  the holding company s financial condition and ability to operate as going concern 
see item a 
risk factors  risks relating to the recapitalization process  of this annual report on form k 
general business  economic and political conditions the company s business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in puerto rico and the united states 
significant business and economic conditions include short and long term interest rates  inflation and the strength of the puerto rico and us economies and housing markets 
if any of these conditions deteriorate  the company s business and earnings could be adversely affected 
for example  business and economic conditions that negatively impact household income could decrease the demand for residential mortgage loans and increase the number of customers who become delinquent or default on their loans  or  a dramatically rising interest rate environment could decrease the demand for loans 
for information on the current fiscal situation of the commonwealth of puerto rico  please refer to part i  item business  the commonwealth of puerto rico current fiscal situation and item a 
risk factors  in part i of this report 
in addition  general and administrative expenses generally increase with inflation 
however  the increase in real estate values in puerto rico in recent years has been a positive factor for doral financial s mortgage banking business 
the average size of loans originated tends to increase as home values appreciate  which serves to increase loan origination fees and servicing income faster than the cost of providing such services 
additionally  appreciation in real estate property values reduces the loan to value ratio of existing loans  thereby reducing credit exposure 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
see risk management above for a discussion of the effects of changes in interest rates on doral financial s operations 
the company operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of economic  legislative  regulatory and technological changes 
the company faces competition in such areas as mortgage and banking product offerings  rates and fees  and customer service 
in addition  technological advances and increased e commerce activities have  generally  increased accessibility to products and services for customers which has intensified competition among banking and non banking companies in the offering of financial products and services  with or without the need for a physical presence 

table of contents miscellaneous changes in accounting standards adopted in the financial statements share based payments 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payments 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and it also supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires companies to use fair value to measure stock based compensation awards and cease using the intrinsic value method of accounting  which apb allowed and resulted in no expense for many awards of stock options for which the exercise price of the option did not exceed the price of the underlying stock at the grant date 
in addition  sfas r retains the modified grant date model from sfas no 
under that model  compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is adjusted to reflect anticipated forfeitures and the expected outcome of certain conditions 
the fair value of an award is not remeasured after its initial estimation on the grant date  except in the case of a liability award or if the award is modified  based on specific criteria included in sfas r 
also  sfas r clarifies the financial impact of vesting and or acceleration clauses due at retirement 
under the revised sfas  the expense should be fully accrued for any employee that is eligible to retire regardless of the actual retirement experience of the employer 
the adoption of this statement on january  did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the company since in  doral financial started to expense the fair value of stock options granted to employees using the modified prospective method under sfas under this method  the company expenses the fair value of all employee stock options granted after january   as well as the unvested portions of previously granted options 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the entity s future cash flows are expected to significantly change if either of the following criteria is met a the configuration risk  timing  and amount of the future cash flows of the asset s received differs significantly from the configuration of the future cash flows of the asset s transferred  b the entity specific value of the asset s received differs from the entity specific value of the asset s transferred  and the difference is significant in relation to the fair values of the assets exchanged 
a qualitative assessment will  in some cases  be conclusive in determining that the estimated cash flows of the entity are expected to significantly change as a result of the exchange 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  this statement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption in accounting changes and error corrections 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and errors corrections 
this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
this statement also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
opinion previously required that such changes in accounting principle be reported as a change in accounting principle by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
this statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of this statement 
sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption in 
table of contents recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
on february   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas  which resolves issues addressed in statement implementation issue no 
d  application of statement to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets dig issue d 
sfas amends sfas to simplify the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments a hybrid financial instrument by permitting fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise required bifurcation  provided that the entire hybrid financial instrument is accounted for on a fair value basis 
sfas also establishes the requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  which replaces the interim guidance in dig issue d sfas amends sfas to allow a qualifying special purpose entity to hold a derivative financial instrument that pertains to beneficial interests other than another derivative financial instrument 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after september  earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year  provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements for any period of the fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the effect  if any  that the adoption of sfas will have on its financial statements 
accounting for servicing of financial assets 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets sfas 
this statement amends sfas with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities 
this statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract  requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value  if practicable  permits en entity to choose between an amortization method or a fair value measure for subsequent recognition for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities  at its initial adoption  permits a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by entities with recognized servicing rights  requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the statement of financial position  and additional disclosures 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of the company s first fiscal year that begins after september  earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year  provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements  including interim financial statements  for any period of that fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the possible impact of the adoption of sfas on its financial statements  commencing on january  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
under the interpretation  the financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts  but without considering time values 
fin is applicable to all uncertain positions for taxes accounted for under sfas  accounting for income taxes  and is not intended to be applied by analogy to other taxes  such as sales taxes  value added taxes  or property taxes 
significant elements of the new guidance include the following recognition a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits 
measurement the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
change in judgment the assessment of the recognition threshold and the measurement of the associated tax benefit might change as new information becomes available 
unrecognized tax benefits should be recognized in the period that the position reaches the recognition 
table of contents threshold  which might occur prior to absolute finality of the matter 
similarly  recognized tax benefits should be derecognized in the period in which the position falls below the threshold 
interest penalties a taxpayer is required to accrue interest and penalties that  under relevant tax law  the taxpayer would be regarded as having incurred 
accordingly  under fin  interest would start to accrue in the period that it would begin accruing under the relevant tax law  and penalties should be accrued in the first period for which a position is taken or is expected to be taken on a tax return that would give rise to the penalty 
how a company classifies interest and penalties in the income statement is an accounting policy decision 
the company should disclose that policy and the amounts recognized 
disclosures fin requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures  including discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in the recognized tax benefits over the next months  a description of open tax years by major jurisdictions  and a roll forward of all unrecognized tax benefits  presented as a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the unrecognized tax benefits on a worldwide aggregated basis 
after considering other applicable guidance such as the guidance that the emerging issues task force specifies in issue  uncertainties related to income taxes in a purchase business combination  a company should record the change in net assets that results from the application of fin as an adjustment to retained earnings 
the accounting provisions of fin will be effective for the company beginning january  the company does not expect that the adoption of this accounting interpretation will have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
the definition of fair value retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value 
this statement clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability is a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability 
therefore  the definition focuses on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability at the measurement date an exit price  not the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability at the measurement date an entry price 
this statement emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  this statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the notion of unobservable inputs is intended to allow for situations in which there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date 
in those situations  the reporting entity need not undertake all possible efforts to obtain information about market participant assumptions 
however  the reporting entity must not ignore information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available without undue cost and effort 

table of contents this statement expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition 
the disclosures focus on the inputs used to measure fair value and for recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs within level of the fair value hierarchy  the effect of the measurements on earnings or changes in net assets for the period 
this statement encourages entities to combine the fair value information disclosed under this statement with the fair value information disclosed under other accounting pronouncements  including fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  where practicable 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the effect  if any  of the adoption of this statement on its financial statements  commencing on january  accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
this accounting standard requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with single employer defined benefit pension  retiree healthcare and other post retirement plans in their financial statements 
under past accounting standards  the funded status of an employer s post retirement benefit plan ie  the difference between the plan assets and obligations was not always completely reported in the balance sheet 
past standards only required an employer to disclose the complete funded status of its plans in the notes to the financial statements 
specifically  sfas requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status 
measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year with limited exceptions 
recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
those changes will be reported in comprehensive income of a business entity and in changes in net assets of a not for profit organization 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective for the company as of december  the company had no defined benefit or post employment benefit plans 
as of december   the adoption of sfas will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
in june  the emerging issues tax force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
the provisions of eitf will be effective for the company as of january  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
accounting for purchases of life insurance 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
accounting for purchases of life insurance determining the amount that could be realized in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for purchases of life insurance eitf 
eitf focuses on how an entity should determine the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date in applying ftb  and whether the determination should be on an individual or group policy basis 

table of contents at the september meeting  the eitf affirmed as a final consensus that the cash surrender value and any additional amounts provided by the contractual terms of the insurance policy that are realizable at the balance sheet date should be considered in determining the amount that could be realized under ftb  and any amounts that are not immediately payable to the policyholder in cash should be discounted to their present value 
additionally  the eitf affirmed as a final consensus the tentative conclusion that in determining the amount that could be realized companies should assume that policies will be surrendered on an individual by individual basis  rather than surrendering the entire group policy 
also  the eitf reached a consensus that contractual limitations on the ability to surrender a policy do not affect the amount to be reflected under ftb  but  if significant  the nature of those restrictions should be disclosed 
the company is currently evaluating any impact that the adoption of issue may have on its statement of financial condition or results of operations 
issuer s accounting for a previously bifurcated conversion option in a convertible debt instrument 
in november  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on eitf issue no 
 issuer s accounting for a previously bifurcated conversion option in a convertible debt instrument when the conversion option no longer meets the bifurcation criteria in fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities eitf 
the consensus provides that a previously bifurcated conversion option in a convertible debt instrument for which the embedded conversion option no longer meets the bifurcation criteria in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  should be reclassified at its fair value on the date of reclassification to stockholders equity 
any debt discount recognized when the conversion option was bifurcated from the convertible dent instrument should continue to be amortized 
eitf should be applied to all previously bifurcated conversion options in convertible dent instruments that no longer meet the bifurcation criteria in sfas  in interim or annual periods beginning after december  as of december  the company does not have any convertible debt instrument 
sfas no 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new statement does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in fasb statements no 
 fair value measurements  and no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no
