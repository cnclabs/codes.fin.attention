company overview we are a leading provider of software products that enable the rapid and effective design and verification of large  complex semiconductors used in networking and communications  semiconductor  military and aerospace  consumer  computer and peripheral  and other electronics systems 
we operate in one segment  the development and licensing of software products to these markets 
we market and sell our products throughout the world  principally through our own sales channel 
in some parts of asia and europe  we sell through distributors 
distributor sales have been insignificant relative to total sales and we expect this to continue 
additionally  we periodically provide custom software development services for our customers or partners 
this work typically involves modifications to our existing product line negotiated with the customer 
our geographic distribution of revenue for the last three years has been approximately from north america  from japan  from europe and from the rest of asia 

table of contents our products include the following fpga solutions synplify and synplify pro in  we introduced synplify  our logic synthesis product that enables customers to implement their designs in fpgas quickly and easily 
in may  we launched synplify pro  our advanced fpga logic synthesis product incorporating improved productivity features and offering enhanced results 
synplify premier introduced in october  synplify premier builds upon our innovative synthesis technology and adds new graph based physical synthesis and real time simulator like visibility into operating fpga devices 
we invented graph based physical synthesis to improve timing closure by means of a single pass physical synthesis flow for nm and below fpgas 
identify in november  we acquired an rtl debug product from bridgessilicon  inc which we introduced under a new synplicity product name  identify 
this product allows engineers to debug their fpgas directly within their rtl source code during chip operation 
in  and  revenue from our fpga product line accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively 
dsp solution synplify dsp in july  we introduced synplify dsp  our first system level synthesis product created to bridge system level dsp design and analysis and semiconductor hardware design 
synplify dsp performs high level dsp optimizations from a simulink specification 
in  and  revenue from our dsp product line accounted for  and less than of total revenue  respectively 
asic verification solution certify in  we introduced certify  a software product for the verification of asics using prototypes consisting of multiple fpgas 
our certify product enables design teams to create hardware prototypes early in the design process when design changes are easier and less costly 
in  and  revenue from our asic verification product line accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively 
structured asic and asic synthesis solutions synplify asic is our logic synthesis product for asic design 
amplify rapidchip  amplify issp  and amplify accelarray are physical synthesis products developed specifically for lsi logic s rapidchip  nec electronics issp and fujitsu microelectronics accelarray s architectures  respectively 
in march  one of our three partners serving the structured asic and asic synthesis markets announced its decision to cease further development of its semiconductor product for which our software product was designed specifically and exclusively 
after this announcement  we evaluated the impact of this decision and other factors and decided to exit the structured asic and asic synthesis markets the asic products and to refocus our efforts on our core competencies in our fpga synthesis  dsp synthesis and asic verification product lines 
as a result  we eliminated certain positions in engineering and sales and marketing and reassigned various employees  principally in engineering  from asic to other areas where we perceive positive growth opportunities and wrote off capitalized software development costs related to the asic products 
we have ceased to offer the asic products to customers while we continue to support existing customers who had previously purchased our products 
we anticipate customer support will be required on a declining bass though the middle 
table of contents of in  and  revenue from our structured asic and asic synthesis product line accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively 
our total revenue is comprised of license revenue  maintenance revenue and bundled license and services revenue 
for  and   and  respectively  of our sales have come from perpetual and term license sales 
the majority of the remaining sales have come from time based licenses 
customers who buy perpetual licenses will typically sign one year maintenance agreements which provide electronic  internet based technical support and telephone support as well as unspecified product updates when and if available 
time based licenses include maintenance services for the duration of their respective terms 
we also offer two year and three year term licenses for certain products under which the customer purchases the first year of maintenance with the license and can renew maintenance in each of the following one or two years 
custom software development services revenue is recorded in bundled license and services revenue 
financial overview total revenue for was million  an increase from million in license revenue for was million  an decrease from million in maintenance revenue for was million  a increase from million in bundled license and services revenue for was million  a increase from million in operating income for was million  which included stock based compensation expense of million

net income for was million  a decrease from million in diluted net income per share for was  a decrease from in working capital for was million  an increase from million in deferred revenue for was million  an increase from million in critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we license our software products as perpetual licenses  term licenses and time based licenses 
in addition  we also generate revenue from custom software development services  through distributors and original equipment manufacturers oems 
revenue recognition criteria in accordance with aicpa statement of position  modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions  we recognize revenue based upon the residual method after all elements other than maintenance have been delivered and the conditions stated below have been met evidence of an arrangement is received from the customer  
table of contents delivery of the product and license key has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
we make judgments as to whether collection of the fee is probable based on the analysis provided by our credit review procedures 
revenue on arrangements to end user customers that have met all of the revenue recognition criteria except probability of collection is recognized as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally as payments are received 
revenue from sales to distributors  who do not have a right to return  is considered to have met the probability of collection criterion when either we have received payment for the product or we assess that we have a substantial and sustained history of collections from the distributor 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional  of revenues from distributors that we deemed to have substantial and sustained history of collections 
additionally  we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable for sales with non standard payment terms by evaluating our history of collections from these customers and or their current financial standing 
license and maintenance offerings license and maintenance revenue we offer perpetual licenses for our products  whereby the customer receives the right to use the software license indefinitely 
the first year of maintenance  which is renewable in subsequent years  is typically sold with the perpetual license 
we also offer two and three year term licenses for certain products  where the customer has rights to use the license for such periods 
the first year of maintenance  which is renewable in subsequent years during the term of the agreement  is typically sold with term licenses 
maintenance revenue from perpetual and term licenses allows customers under maintenance agreements to receive unspecified product updates  electronic  internet based and telephone technical support throughout their maintenance period  which is typically one year 
the majority of our customers renew their maintenance contracts annually  at or near the list price for maintenance  which is either or of the license list price  depending on the product  which establishes vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of maintenance 
for larger value contracts entered into subsequent to march   we incorporated substantive contractual maintenance renewal rates into our agreements  at a consistent percentage of the net license fee paid  which establishes vsoe of fair value of maintenance for that class of arrangement per sop this methodology can be applied to arrangements of either perpetual or multi year term licenses  where the first year s maintenance is generally purchased with the term or perpetual licenses and the subsequent years are optional and can be purchased at the same percentage of the net license fee as the first year s maintenance 
perpetual license and term license revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product as license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations statements of operations 
maintenance revenue from perpetual and term license sales is recognized on a straight line basis over the maintenance period as maintenance revenue in the statements of operations 
bundled license and services revenue we also generate revenue from time based licenses 
time based licenses include maintenance services for the duration of their terms 
revenue from time based licenses is recognized as bundled license and services 
table of contents revenue in the statements of operations  on a straight line basis over the period of the maintenance  as we do not have vsoe of the fair value of maintenance for time based licenses since it is not priced or offered separately from the license 
in addition  we periodically sell perpetual and term licenses to oems for incorporation into their products and distribution to their customers 
as part of these arrangements we have certain maintenance and support obligations to the oems 
since the maintenance associated with these types of arrangements is not sold separately  we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue among the elements 
thus  we recognize revenue from these arrangements on a straight line basis over the maintenance period 
in  we entered into arrangements with certain oems to slightly modify our existing products to work with the individual oems products 
for the customization services  we have been able to make dependable estimates of progress towards completion 
since the maintenance and customized services associated with these types of arrangement are not typically sold separately  we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue among the elements 
thus  we recognize revenue from these arrangements on a straight line basis over the longer period of either the maintenance or the customization services 
prior to  we entered into various custom software development agreements with semiconductor manufacturers to customize certain of our structured asic products 
this work typically involved significant modifications to our products under a statement of work negotiated with the customer 
when time based licenses were purchased as part of the agreement and delivery of the customized product had occurred  we recognized revenue from both the development and license fees on a straight line basis over the period of the maintenance  as we did not have vsoe of the fair value of maintenance for time based licenses 
when licenses were not being purchased as part of the agreement  we recognized revenue from these development fees on a percentage of completion basis as determined by the relationship of the contract costs incurred to date and estimated total contract costs  which are regularly reviewed during the life of the contract 
revenue recognized from these development agreements represented less than of total revenue for  and and was recorded in bundled license and services revenue in the statement of operations 
on occasion  we may sell time based licenses and perpetual or term licenses combined within a single order 
for these transactions  we generally recognize revenue from the entire transaction on a straight line basis over the term of the longest period of maintenance  as generally we do not have vsoe of the fair value of maintenance for the time based licenses 
goodwill  intangible assets and capitalized software costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment using a fair value approach 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter as well as whenever indicators of impairment exist 
our intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of five years 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  long lived assets  including intangible assets and property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recoverability of a long lived asset other than goodwill is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in 
table of contents forecasting future operating results and cash flows and  should different conditions prevail or judgments be made  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas  at each balance sheet date  our unamortized capitalized software costs are compared to the net realizable value of that product 
the amounts by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the net realizable value of that asset are written off 
due to our exit from the structured asic and asic synthesis markets in march  we wrote off capitalized software development costs related to our asic products during the three months ended march  in the amount of  the restructuring charges are discussed in further detail in the paragraph below 
restructuring charge in march  one of our partners  lsi logic  announced its decision to cease further development of its rapidchip semiconductor product which served the structured asic markets 
our amplify rapidchip software product was designed specifically and exclusively for lsi logic s rapidchip product 
after this announcement  we evaluated the impact of lsi logic s decision and other factors and decided to exit the structured asic and asic synthesis markets and to refocus our efforts on our core competencies in fpga synthesis  dsp synthesis and asic verification product lines 
as a result  we eliminated certain positions in engineering  sales and marketing and reassigned various employees  principally in engineering  from asic to other areas where we perceived we had positive growth opportunities 
on march   our board of directors approved our restructuring plan  which was implemented under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this restructuring program included an reduction in force primarily focused in our research and development department and a write off of capitalized software development costs to their net realizable value 
the restructuring plan has been completed and there was no remaining balance accrued as of december  the restructuring activity for the twelve months ended december  was as follows restructuring charge incurred in march net cash payments asset impair ments accrued restructuring charge at march  net cash payments in second quarter accrued restructuring charge at december  in thousands severance and related costs capitalized software development cost asset impairment of capitalized software prepaid maintenance capitalized development cost allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain and update quarterly an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
the balance in the allowance account is comprised of a specific reserve for any particular receivable when collectibility is not probable and a provision for non specific accounts based on a specified range of percentages derived from historical experience applied to the outstanding balance in each aged group 
if after pursuing collection efforts on a specifically reserved receivable  payment is not expected  the receivable is deemed uncollectible and is written off 
such losses have not been material in any year  however  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the table in schedule ii  valuation and qualifying 
table of contents accounts and reserves of this annual report provides a roll forward of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and such evaluations are based on available evidence of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our ability to generate positive domestic taxable income in is greatly dependent on the acceptance by our customers of new product introductions 
since the risks inherent in these new products is such that it limits our ability to generate verifiable forecasts of future domestic taxable income  a valuation allowance in an amount equal to our net deferred tax assets of december  was recorded 
valuation of stock based payments under sfas r our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests 
we primarily rely on two stock option plans that provide broad discretion to our board of directors to create appropriate equity incentives for members of our board of directors and our employees 
substantially all of our employees participate in our stock option program 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  requiring us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards 
we elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas and compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  which represents management s best estimate 
a summary explanation follows expected stock price volatility our computation of expected volatility is based on historical volatility for the expected term of the options 
expected term of option our expected term represents the period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical experience of similar stock options with consideration to the contractual terms of the stock options  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
expected dividend yield the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
expected risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
forfeiture rate the forfeiture rate is based on a review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation
