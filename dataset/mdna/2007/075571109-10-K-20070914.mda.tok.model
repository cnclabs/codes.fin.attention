item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks factors under item a of this report 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time the products are received by the customers in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for store sales at the point at which the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register 
for on line sales  we recognize revenue at the time the customer receives the product 
we estimate and defer revenue and the related product costs for shipments that are in transit to the customer 
customers typically receive goods within one week of shipment 
we reflect amounts related to shipping billed to customers in net sales and the related costs in cost of goods sold 
sales tax collected from customers on retail sales are recorded net of retail sales at the time of the transaction 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
if actual returns are greater than those projected  we may include additional sales returns in the future 
discounts offered to customers consist primarily of point of sale markdowns and are recorded at the time of the related sale as a reduction of revenue 
we include the value of points and rewards earned by our loyalty program members as a liability and a reduction of revenue at the time the points and rewards are earned based on historical conversion and redemption rates 
the associated revenue is recognized when the rewards are redeemed or expire 
we carry gift certificates sold as a liability and recognize revenue when the gift certificate is redeemed 
similarly  customers may receive a store credit in exchange for returned goods 
we carry store credits as a liability until redeemed 
we recognize unredeemed store credits and gift certificates as revenue three and four years  respectively  after issuance 
we record royalty revenue from product licensees as earned 
we recognize wholesale licensee revenue from sale of product to international licensee operated bebe stores as earned  the stores are excluded from comparable store sales 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock options and awards issued to employees in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under sfas no 
r  stock based awards to employees are required to be recognized as compensation expense  based on the calculated fair value on the date of grant 
we determine the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected term  which affect the calculated values 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
we determine market based on the estimated net realizable value  which is generally the merchandise selling price 
to ensure that our raw material is properly valued we age the fabric inventory and record a reserve in accordance with our established policy  which is based on historical experience 
to ensure our finished goods inventory is properly valued  we review the age and turnover of our inventory and record a reserve if the selling price is marked down below cost 
these assumptions can have an impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
we estimate shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and balance sheet date based on historic shrinkage trends 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as store closures or poor performing stores  indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value we record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s estimated fair value 
in addition  at the time a decision is made to close a store  we record an impairment charge  if appropriate  or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset 
historically  our impairment charges have been immaterial 
during fiscal  we did not record a charge for the impairment of store assets 
during fiscal and  we recorded charges for the impairment of store assets of  and  respectively 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
accrued litigation 
we accrue estimates of probable liabilities associated with lawsuits and claims 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
as information becomes available  we assess the potential liabilities related to pending litigation and may revise our estimates as necessary 
such revisions of estimates could materially impact the results of operations and financial position 
self insurance 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for employee related health care benefits 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of those claims incurred but not reported 
any projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  we may need to adjust reserves in the future 
income taxes 
we accrue liabilities for estimates of probable settlements of domestic and foreign tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years may be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from foreign tax credit carryforwards as the utilization of some of these credits is not assured

seasonality of business and quarterly results our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries 
as a result  our typical store generates a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the second quarter of our fiscal year which includes the holiday selling season compared to other quarters of our fiscal year 
if for any reason our sales were below seasonal norms during the second quarter of our fiscal year  our annual operating results would be negatively impacted 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements vary widely throughout the year and generally peak in the first and second fiscal quarters 
at july   we had approximately million of cash and equivalents and short term marketable securities on hand 
in addition  we had a revolving line of credit  under which we could borrow or issue letters of credit up to a combined total of million  which expires march  as of july   there were no cash borrowings outstanding  and there were million of letters of credit outstanding

net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal in fiscal  the payment of dividends exceeded the proceeds from stock options exercised and the related tax benefits 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with our cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements through fiscal our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  the size and number of new and expanded stores  investment costs for management information systems  potential acquisitions and or joint ventures  repurchase of stock and future results of operations 
on september   we entered into an agreement with our former vice chairperson  neda mashouf  to repurchase million shares of our common stock beneficially owned by ms 
mashouf at a price per share of  an aggregate purchase price of  we expect the transaction to close prior to september  summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands amount of commitment expiration period total less than year years years after years other commercial commitments operating leases capital leases trade letters of credit unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations and commercial commitments unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
included in the purchase obligations category above are commitments for inventory purchases  capital expenditures  information technology and professional services 
most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice  usually to days 
we excluded amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above 
as of july   there were no cash borrowings outstanding  and there were million of letters of credit outstanding under the line of credit 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the recent past 
however  we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we currently maintain a portfolio of variable investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term marketable securities 
marketable securities consist of closed end variable interest rate funds that invest primarily in tax exempt municipal bonds 
due to the variable nature of these investments  their value is typically not subject to market rate changes 
according to our investment policy  we may invest in taxable and tax exempt instruments 
in addition  the policy establishes limits on credit quality  maturity  issuer and type of instrument 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
investments are considered short term marketable securities if the original maturity is between three months and twelve months  or long term marketable securities if the original maturity is greater than twelve months 
auction rate securities have stated maturities beyond one year but are priced and traded as short term instruments due to the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset mechanism and are classified as short term when they represent investments of cash that are intended for use in current operations 
the following table lists our cash equivalents and short term marketable securities at july  book value fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents weighted average interest rate short term marketable securities weighted average interest rate total the interest payable on our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates rose significantly  our results from operations and cash flows would not be affected since we have no outstanding borrowings 
foreign currency risks 
we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states  substantially all of which are negotiated and settled in us dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we also operate a subsidiary for which the functional currency is the canadian dollar 
in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  assets and liabilities of canada s operations are translated into us dollars at year end rates  while income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year 
the related translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholder s equity 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
