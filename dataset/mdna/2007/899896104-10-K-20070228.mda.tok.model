total sales by the acquired units were million 
there was also a net increase from the tupperware units in asia pacific and north america  which includes tupperware mexico  and beauticontrol north america 
sales in europe were up  from the benefit of including the south african beauty units in the segment  which did not have sales for the first eleven months of prior to their acquisition 
for the year  net income was up primarily due to the full year inclusion of the acquired units  which generated million in profit  or million before considering amortization of intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting  compared with million in for the one month they were owned by the company 
profit also improved in the tupperware units in asia pacific  there was a significantly lower loss by tupperware united states and canada  and a small improvement in profit by beauticontrol north america 
also impacting the comparison was million of amortization of purchase accounting intangibles in versus million in  higher unallocated corporate expenses  lower re engineering and impairment charges  and a large  favorable tax related settlement with the company s former parent 
net interest expense did not change significantly  reflecting higher ongoing expense in associated with higher average borrowings and costs in associated with changes in the company s debt financing  both in connection with the acquisition 
the higher unallocated corporate expenses in were due to higher public relations costs in an effort to contemporize the company s brand perception  increased equity compensation and a net loss from foreign exchange versus net gains in in  the company generated cash flow from operating activities of million 
the year end debt to total capital ratio was percent compared with percent last year 
in  the company adopted sfas r share based payment in  which requires the company to record compensation expense for all unvested options that were issued prior to the company s adoption of fair value accounting

this change did not impact the total compensation cost to be recognized but did accelerate it 
net sales increased four percent in versus  both as reported and in local currency 
three percentage points of the increase reflected the inclusion of the acquired units results for one month in beauticontrol north america achieved a strong sales increase  which was mostly offset by a decrease in tupperware north america coming from the united states business 
net income was down two percent in spite of improvements from in both sales and profit from the segments 
this was primarily due to higher interest expense and re engineering and impairment charges  along with lower land sales 
the company had a negative provision for income taxes due to a settlement related to pre june taxes as well as various audit settlements and planning transactions 

table of contents unallocated expenses the company allocates corporate operating expenses to its reporting segments based upon estimated time spent related to those segments where a direct relationship is present and based upon segment revenue for general expenses 
the unallocated expenses reflect amounts unrelated to segment operations 
allocations are determined at the beginning of the year based upon estimated expenditures 
the unallocated expenses increased during as compared with primarily due to equity compensation  net losses from foreign exchange and higher public relations costs in an effort to contemporize the company s brand perception 
during  the company continued its program to sell land for development near its orlando  florida headquarters which began in pretax gains totaling million million after tax were recognized as a result of transactions completed during this amount compared with pretax gains of million million after tax during and million million after tax during gains on land transactions are recorded based upon when the transactions close and proceeds are collected 
transactions in one period may not be representative of what may occur in other periods 
additionally in  the company recorded a pretax loss of million as a result of a fire at its former manufacturing facility in halls  tennessee 
the amount recorded is based on its current best estimate 
as more information becomes available related to this event  adjustments may be necessary 
the company also recognized in a million gain for the preliminary settlement of an insurance claim related to hurricane damage incurred at the company s headquarters  and in a million gain related to the final settlement of this claim 
included in net income were pretax charges of million for re engineering and impairment compared with million in million and million after tax  respectively 
these charges are discussed in the re engineering costs section following 
international operations accounted for  and percent of the company s sales in  and  respectively 
they also accounted for and percent of the company s net segment profit in and  respectively  and all of the company s net segment profit in the increase in the percent of sales from international operations in was due to the inclusion of the acquired units results of operations for a full year 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to percent in compared with percent in  which was down from percent in the slightly higher gross margin percentage in was due to the inclusion of a full year of the acquired units results  which run a slightly higher margin rate than the other units  as well as improvement in north america from the utilization of previously written down product  lower sales under incentive offers and lifo reserve liquidation 
these were partially offset by a lower margin percentage in europe due to lower utilization of production capacity and a higher proportion of sales under incentive offers with a lower margin percentage for such items in germany 
on an overall basis in  the decrease was primarily due to higher raw material costs  particularly resin  and a higher proportion of promotional sales in europe reflecting efforts to stimulate sales force recruiting  customer demand and party attendance 
costs and expenses delivery  sales and administrative expense ds a as a percentage of sales was   and percent  in   and  respectively 
in  the increase in ds a as a percent of sales was due to the inclusion of a full year of the acquired units results  which run a slightly higher rate than the other units and million of amortization of intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting for the acquired units sales force relationships compared to million in excluding the amortization of intangible assets  ds a as a percentage of sales was and percent in and  respectively 
in  the decline in ds a as a percent of sales was due to a continued focus on operating expense reductions throughout the company  particularly in tupperware united states and canada despite the lower sales volume 

table of contents as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company includes costs related to the distribution of its products in ds a expense 
as a result  the company s gross margin may not be comparable with other companies that include these costs in cost of products sold 
re engineering costs 
as the company continuously evaluates its operating structure in light of current business conditions and strives to maintain the most efficient possible cost structure  it periodically implements actions designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency 
these actions may result in re engineering costs related to facility downsizing and closure as well as related asset write downs and other costs that may be necessary in light of the revised operating landscape 
in addition  the company may recognize gains upon disposal of closed facilities or other activities directly related to its re engineering efforts 
over the past three years  the company has incurred such costs gains as detailed below that were included in the following income statement captions in millions re engineering and impairment charges cost of products sold total pretax re engineering costs total after tax re engineering costs in  re engineering and impairment charges of million included million primarily related to severance costs incurred to reduce headcount in the company s canada  belgium  philippines  australian mold making and europe operations 
the remaining million was to write down the value of certain assets of the company s philippines facility 
in  re engineering and impairment charges of million included million primarily related to severance costs incurred to reduce headcount in the company s south carolina  orlando  australian mold making  belgium  france and portugal operations 
in december  the company reached a decision to restructure its manufacturing facility in hemingway  south carolina 
in  the company implemented its plans related to the hemingway facility which resulted in the elimination of positions and pretax severance and outplacement costs of approximately million 
an additional million of severance was recorded for the elimination of positions in the company s us sales operation 
the balance of the million charge was largely related to impairment charges recorded to write down the value of certain of the company s united states warehousing and distribution capacity and related equipment  as well as a former manufacturing facility in halls  tennessee 
in addition to headcount reductions  million of pretax costs were incurred to relocate equipment to other facilities 
as a result of the capacity shift  the company also realized a million reduction of its reserve for united states produced inventory that is accounted for under the last in first out lifo method as that inventory was sold 
both of these items were recorded in cost of products sold 
in  the re engineering and impairment charges included severance costs of approximately million primarily related to headcount reductions in the united states  japan and the philippines 
the philippines action also resulted in an asset impairment charge of approximately million 
also included in charges was a million write off of currency translation adjustments related to the company s decision to liquidate a foreign subsidiary during the year which was previously classified in other comprehensive income 
the decision in december of to restructure the manufacturing facility in hemingway  south carolina in early resulted in an asset impairment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of partially offsetting these charges was the reversal of approximately million of prior accruals primarily due to lower than estimated severance costs in europe as all activities were concluded 
for further details of the re engineering actions  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
tax rate 
the effective tax rates for   and were   and percent  respectively 
in  the tax rate was impacted by tax planning and tax law changes in  which was partially offset by the inclusion of the acquired units operations which currently carry a higher effective tax rate than the remainder of the company s operations 

table of contents in  the company reached a settlement with its former parent company resulting in a cash receipt of million including interest related to pre june tax liabilities 
this generated a net tax benefit of approximately million after considering amounts previously recorded as a receivable on the company s balance sheet and a provision for taxes related to the interest portion of the settlement 
this transaction  together with various audit settlements and year end tax planning transactions  resulted in the negative provision for income taxes for the rate reflected the impact of re engineering actions and gains on property dispositions  including the hurricane related insurance gain discussed earlier  as well as the net favorable resolution of domestic and international tax audit contingencies 
the company has recognized deferred tax assets based upon its analysis of the likelihood of realizing the benefits inherent in them and where it has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefits would ultimately be realized and as such  no valuation allowance was necessary 
this assessment was based upon expectations of improving domestic operating results as well as anticipated gains related to the company s sales of land held for development near its orlando  florida headquarters 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions may be entered into to facilitate realization of these benefits 
refer to the critical accounting policies section and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussions of the company s methodology for evaluating deferred tax assets 
based on expected revenue and profit contributions of the company s various operations  management expects a tax rate in the low percent range for net interest expense 
the company incurred million of net interest expense in compared with million in and million in increased interest expense in was driven largely by the higher level of borrowing that resulted from financing the acquisition in late the company s primary borrowing in was through term loans due in under its credit facility 
the principal balance on these term loans at the beginning of was million  but was reduced by principal payments to million as of the end of the interest rate charged on these loans is a floating libor based rate and resulted in interest expense of million in  net of the impact from floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements on million of the outstanding term loans 
additional interest expense on borrowings under the company s million committed revolving line of credit totaled million 
the company maintained a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts that reduced interest expense by approximately two million dollars in other interest expense resulted from bank borrowings at the company s subsidiaries around the world and a loan secured by the beauticontrol headquarters in dallas 
interest income during was approximately million  including million earned from an escrow account funded in december at the time of the acquisition 
in order to discharge the company s million percent notes due in october  the company funded an escrow account with cash in december since the notes were paid off from the escrowed funds in october  the escrow account has been closed  and no interest income was earned thereon after october  the sharp increase in was due to slightly higher interest rates in  along with the requirement to pay a make whole payment of million for the early retirement of the company s million notes in connection with entering into new financing arrangements for the acquisition and million for the discharge of obligations related to million of notes due in issuance costs of approximately million related to retired debt were also written off as part of interest expense 
a credit of million to recognize net deferred gains on interest rate swaps related to these debt agreements that were previously closed offset some of this expense 
interest expense also included a million payment to close an interest rate hedge the company previously entered into to lock in the base interest rate on the previously expected refinancing of its notes 
as the company progressed toward closing the acquisition it became no longer probable in the third quarter of that the debt would be refinanced  and this agreement was no longer an effective hedge 
see additional discussion in liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents during the first quarter of  the company will begin hedging million worth of its yen net equity and million of its euro net equity through a series of new forward contracts 
this will significantly reduce interest expense in the future with an approximate million impact in the initial forward contracts will mature in and and will be settled in cash such that the company will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of the yen and euro versus the us dollar 
over time  this exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the value of operating cash flows generated in the yen and the euro 
segment results vs 
as a result of changes in the company s management structure as well as a re evaluation of the company s operating segment definitions  the company reorganized its previously reported segments as follows there have been no changes to the company s beauticontrol north america segment 
international beauticontrol operations are reported in the segments in which the business component geographically resides

increase greater than percent 
na not applicable europe the slight increase in european sales was primarily due to the inclusion of the acquired south african beauty units 
excluding these units  local currency sales were three percent lower largely due to a percent sales decline in germany  the segment s largest market  driven by a reduction in total and active sales force 
in and the german market accounted for million and million of the segment s sales  respectively 
additionally  in the europe segment approximately million less business to business sales than last year contributed to the sales decline 
while the company actively pursues business to business opportunities  sales from this channel are based on reaching agreements with business partners and their product needs  along with consideration of how the arrangements will be integrated with the party plan channel 
consequently  activity in one period may not be indicative of future trends 
other markets that were down versus 
table of contents were the netherlands  austria and switzerland all due to a decrease in average active sales force  and in the case of switzerland a large business to business transaction that did not recur 
these declines were partially offset by tupperware southern africa which had a significant increase in sales versus driven by good recruiting and increases in total and average active sales force 
the emerging markets of russia  turkey and poland had strong increases in with growth of percent versus last year  while their contribution to total sales for the segment grew from percent in to percent in the largest sales growth contribution came from russia  which was up percent and contributed the largest dollar increase from last year of all markets in the segment 
the segment overall ended the year with an eight percent sales force size advantage  but had a decline of eight percent in average active sales force in versus although local currency sales increased slightly  profit was down percent as reported and in local currency resulting in a decline of percentage points in return on sales 
the lower return on sales was driven by the decline in german sales which  despite the downturn  continue to carry a return above the segment average  and the mix of markets generating the profit  with a slight impact driven by the inclusion of a full year of results for the south african beauty units which operate at a lower return on sales 
the higher operating costs were driven by increased costs in the growth markets and higher promotional expenses in an effort to increase the size of the total and active sales forces 
asia pacific net sales for the year increased both as reported and in local currency 
excluding naturcare  the acquired japan beauty unit that only had sales in one month in  sales were up eight percent in local currency 
sales were up in virtually all markets  led by the emerging markets of china  india and indonesia  which in total were up percent  with the largest increase coming from china up percent 
in china  direct selling has been limited by law  and the company reaches consumers through independent store fronts where the number of storefronts grew percent to over  japan  korea and australia had modest growth in local currency versus driven by a more productive sales force offset by less business to business sales in korea 
the decline in korea s business to business sales is likely to continue 
excluding naturcare  segment profit increased in both reported and local currency reflecting improvement in most markets and led by the emerging markets 
though costs showed a dollar increase versus  as a percent of sales they were down driven primarily by strong sales growth  resulting in a percentage point increase in return on sales 
north america the slight increase in north american sales was primarily due to growth by tupperware mexico offset by a slight decrease in the united states 
mexico sales were up slightly in local currency driven by a slightly larger sales force  an increase in business to business sales and five percent growth in the sale of beauticontrol products 
canada sales were up modestly due to better productivity by the sales force partially due to the implementation of a new compensation plan which mirrors the plan implemented in the us last year 
in the united states  sales were down slightly versus last year although they were up in each of the third and fourth quarters versus the prior year 
though total and active sales forces were down for the year  productivity was up driven by the new multi tier sales force compensation system implemented in this new compensation system provides for override commissions on group sales with an emphasis on the earnings opportunity and recruiting new sellers into the business 
this along with increased company sponsored training and an experience based party format are designed to continue to improve future results 
the company is seeking to improve its us business through a refreshed  interactive party format  continuing to introduce innovative and fashion forward products  public relations activities to ensure a broad understanding of the company s current product categories  innovations and fashionability and a better balance between its emphasis on products and its sales force earnings opportunity 

table of contents north america s profit came from tupperware mexico where profit was up percent primarily reflecting sales growth but also a slight improvement in promotion and distribution expenses 
there was a decrease in the us loss of over percent 
the lower loss was driven by a higher gross margin percentage and a reduction in ds a expenses 
the improvement in gross margin was due to the utilization of previously written down product  fewer sales incentive offers and a reduction in the lifo reserve 
the improvement in expenses was primarily due to a reduction in distribution costs driven by improved freight pricing and a greater number of consolidated shipments 
additionally  in the united states  post retirement benefit costs were million favorable to last year and are expected to decline another to million in see note retirement benefit plans for further details 
beauticontrol north america beauticontrol north america had a slight increase in sales and profit 
the business started the year slow but was up percent in the second half of the year 
the improvement in sales  particularly in the second half of the year  was due to increased volume reflecting a year over year total and active sales force size advantage 
recruiting remained strong again this year with a spring campaign that was the second largest in beauticontrol s history 
the sales force growth continued to be fueled by both a strong earnings opportunity and an easy  replicable interactive party experience  the spa escape 
the sales growth was the primary reason for the profit improvement along with a slight improvement in gross margin driven by a better mix of sales 
these were partially offset by higher operating expenses due to strong recruiting and transition costs incurred for a new manufacturing facility 
the transition should be complete by the end of the first quarter of international beauty the acquired units sales and profit were included in the company s results beginning on december  with the closing of the acquisition 
the sales increase in the international beauty segment reflected million of sales by the acquired units in the segment 
the largest market in the segment  fuller mexico  accounts for more than percent of sales and an even greater proportion of segment profit 
this business achieved significant sales growth from a larger and more productive sales force versus  which was partially offset primarily by lower sales in the philippines due a smaller sales force 
the prior year results reflect million of sales by the acquired units and the operations of tupperware businesses in central and south america and the philippines 
combined  these businesses did not materially impact the comparison 
segment profit reflected the same factors as sales  along with approximately million of negative impact from amortization expense primarily associated with intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting for the acquired units sales force relationships 
good progress was made during the year transitioning the acquired units into tupperware brands 
the nutrimetics australia business is similar to beauticontrol north america in terms of its skin care focused product line  party plan orientation and sales force compensation model 
its party format and compensation model have been adjusted to be more similar to what has worked well for beauticontrol north america and are expected to reenergize that business 
in central and south america  progress has been made in combining back office functions in brazil and in some cases both beauty and tupperware products are being sold by the same sales force

increase greater than percent 
na not applicable nm not meaningful europe the slight increase in european sales was primarily due to higher business to business sales of million at exchange rates consistent with the emerging markets of russia  turkey and poland had strong increases in with growth of percent from last year 
the largest sales growth contribution came from russia  which was up over percent and contributed the largest dollar increase from last year of all markets in 
table of contents the segment 
south africa and france also contributed nicely to sales growth from due to larger total and active sales forces 
these positive results were partially offset by large sales declines in the nordics  netherlands  austria and germany 
the segment s largest market  germany  was down eight percent from last year 
while it ended the year with a larger sales force size  for most of the year it operated at a sales force size disadvantage 
additionally  a sales force size advantage for most of the fourth quarter did not offset lower sales force productivity due to a difficult consumer environment 
sales in in germany totaled million  as compared with million in the segment overall ended the year with a percent sales force size advantage and achieved a percent average active sales force size advantage in the fourth quarter of versus overall  the segment s sales decline absent the business to business impact noted above was due to lower sales volume  partially offset by a slight increase in overall pricing 
the average pricing increase was negatively impacted by the mix of products sold 
there was also a negative impact from the mix of markets generating sales 
although local currency sales increased slightly  profit was down percent as reported and percent in local currency primarily due to a lower gross margin and higher operating expenses 
the lower gross margin was a result of higher resin costs  which were not totally offset by price increases  and a less favorable sales mix 
the increased operating expenses were primarily for higher promotional expenses in germany to increase the size of the sales force 
asia pacific net sales for the year increased slightly both as reported and in local currency 
this comparison benefited from the inclusion in of a product recall in japan that resulted in sales returns of million  at the foreign exchange rate 
excluding this benefit  local currency sales would have been flat 
significant sales increases in china and korea combined with a strong increase in australia were partially offset by a significant sales decline in japan 
china sales grew over percent and contributed the largest dollar increase in the asia pacific segment during with almost  storefronts operating at the end of  which was up over percent from storefront sales productivity was up as well 
korea benefited from higher business to business transactions and core sales during the year  while australia grew sales through a higher active and more productive sales force 
asia pacific had a small decline in overall sales volume for the year  but was able to offset that with a more favorable mix of products sold as well as lower overall sales discounting 
in spite of a slight sales increase  both reported and local currency profit was flat reflecting results in japan 
the product recall in japan mentioned earlier had no impact on the profitability comparison as the vendor reimbursed the company for lost profit and costs related to the recall 
north america north america had a decline in sales in due to lower volume that was only partially offset by an improved product mix that included fewer sales force support items 
this was due almost exclusively to the performance in the united states  which continued to struggle and had a percent decline in the number of average active sellers in versus in april  the company completed its implementation of a multi tier compensation system for its sales force 
the new system is more competitive in the us market than the previous format and emphasizes building one s business through recruiting 
the company started training its independent sales force in to operate successfully under this new model 

table of contents mexico had a slight increase in sales for the year driven by an increase in the total and active sales force count along with continued growth in the sale of beauticontrol products 
beauty sales grew percent compared with and accounted for percent of mexican sales 
mexico profit improved slightly due to sales growth however  profit growth was less due to strategic investments made to expand beauticontrol s sales contribution 
the segment was about break even in spite of the substantial sales decline in the united states results 
this improvement was largely due to the significant improvements in the united states driven by value chain improvements implemented during and including a restructure of its manufacturing operations in hemingway  south carolina to source the majority of its products from the company s other manufacturing facilities 
the company also realized a benefit of million from reduced lifo reserve needs as united states produced inventory was sold including million directly related to the capacity shift 
additionally  the united states benefited from an approximate four million dollars reallocation of corporate overhead charges 
beauticontrol north america beauticontrol north america had substantial increases in both sales and segment profit in which were largely volume related 
a higher proportion of sales of low priced items to support increased recruiting resulted in a slightly lower average selling price 
the improved performance was a result of substantial increases in both the total and active sales forces during the year with the business closing with a percent advantage in the total sales force 
the sales force growth was fueled by both a strong earnings opportunity and an easy  replicable interactive party experience  the spa escape 
the sales growth was the primary reason for the profit improvement along with the absence of an approximate million charge in the first quarter of related to an accrual for legal matters and an executive retirement 
international beauty the acquired units sales and profit were included in the company s results beginning on december  with the closing of the acquisition of sara lee corporation s direct selling businesses 
the sales and profit were million and million  respectively  including million of purchase accounting amortization 
sales and profit were strong in fuller mexico  partially offset by some weakness in australia and fuller philippines 
after considering incremental interest expense related to the acquisition  the acquired units had little net impact on earnings 
the balance of this segment consisted of tupperware central and south america and the philippines 
combined  these operations did not have a significant impact on segment results as the negative impact of a large decline in the philippines average active sales force was balanced by improvement in central and south america 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
working capital increased  reaching million as of december  compared with million as of december  and million as of december  the current ratio was to at the end of compared with to at the end of and to at the end of the working capital increase was primarily due to cash generated from operations and an increase in accounts receivable driven by strong year end sales in mexico 
these were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
the working capital increase  exclusive of the impact from the acquired units  was due to an increase in cash primarily from cash generated from operations  including the settlement of pre june income taxes with the company s former parent  along with proceeds received upon the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the pay down of debt 
another impact was a decrease in accounts payable in the existing businesses

the company used cash on hand and the term loan borrowings to fund the amount due to sara lee corporation  to discharge its then outstanding million notes due in and to repay its million notes due in the settlement of the notes required make whole payments to the note holders of approximately million 
in anticipation of this transaction  the company closed fixed to variable interest rate swaps with combined notional amounts totaling million that were scheduled to expire in with the notes

closing these swaps resulted in a loss of approximately million that was recorded as a component of income when the notes were settled 
as also discussed in the market risk section  the company exited an agreement to lock in a fixed year treasury rate that was to provide the base interest for an anticipated refinancing of its million notes 
the million cost to exit this arrangement was recorded as a component of interest expense in the third quarter of in addition to the amounts discussed above  upon closure of the transaction  the company expensed unamortized debt issuance costs relating to the settled debt totaling approximately million and recognized deferred net gains related to previously terminated hedging arrangements associated with the settled debt

principal payments on the term loan are percent of the original amount per year in years to and the first quarters of year in quarterly installments 
the balance will be due in a balloon payment at the end of the seven year term

current and committed borrowing facilities and cash generated by operating activities are expected to be adequate to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures 
the company s major markets for its products are australia  france  germany  japan  mexico  russia and the united states 
a significant downturn in the company s business in these markets would adversely impact the company s ability to generate operating cash flows 
the previously discussed downturn in the company s german business has impacted its ability to contribute the same historical level of operating cash flows to the company and the operating losses in the tupperware united states business has impacted its ability to contribute operating cash flows 
however  neither of these situations has resulted in a material negative impact to the company as a whole 
operating cash flows would also be adversely impacted by significant difficulties in the recruitment  retention and activity of the company s independent sales force  the success of new products and promotional programs 
included in the cash balance of million reported at the end of was million denominated in venezuela bolivars 
the balance is primarily a result of favorable operating cash flows in the market 
due to venezuelan government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates  the company can not immediately repatriate this cash at the exchange rate used to translate the venezuelan bolivars into us dollars for inclusion on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
it will apply for  and expects to receive  authorization in to transfer approximately half of such amount out of the country 
it has also implemented other strategies in an effort to eventually repatriate the entire cash balance 
the company believes it could immediately repatriate the cash from venezuela  but it would only be able to do so at a significantly less favorable exchange rate 
this would result in the company having fewer us dollars than currently reported as a component of cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet with the difference recorded as a foreign exchange loss in its consolidated income statement 
the debt to total capital ratio at the end of was percent compared with percent at the end of debt is defined as total debt and capital is defined as total debt plus shareholders equity 
the decrease in debt from the same period a year ago reflected the debt principal payments made from cash generated from operations and from the sale of real estate in the orlando  florida area 
the increase in equity resulted largely from earnings in  reduced by dividends paid during the year 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for was compared with million in and million in the increase in cash from operating activities in versus reflected higher cash pretax income  excluding land sales  of close to million  along with a cash inflow from higher payables and accruals this year as opposed to an outflow last year 
the improvement in payables and accruals was largely due to the management of the timing of payments and the volume of business in certain markets 
there were also smaller improvements in inventory from the sale of slow moving items in certain markets and in non trade receivables reflecting lower vat receivables and amounts relating to hedging transactions 
the main offsets were from cash tax payments of million this year versus net receipts of million in that included a million receipt from the company s former parent 
there was also an outflow from trade receivables in  versus an inflow in  reflecting higher december sales in certain markets  as well as higher past due amounts 
the increase from to was primarily due to the million received in connection with settling pre june income taxes with the company s former parent 
the company also received a refund of approximately million from the united states internal revenue service in settlement of audits for the period to these items were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
there was a cash inflow from settling hedge contracts this year versus an outflow last year due to a weaker us dollar during than in

the most significant type of spending in all years was for molds for new products with the greatest amount spent in europe

at the time of its emergence as a publicly held corporation with its spin off from premark international  inc in may  the company established a target of paying percent of trailing four quarter income as a dividend 
at that time  such a policy equated to a dividend level of approximately per share annually 
despite decreases in income  the company has generated sufficient cash flows from operations  dispositions of property and available borrowing capacity to fund its historical requirement for cash over the period since the spin off  including working capital and capital spending needs  its share repurchase program concluded in  its acquisition of beauticontrol in  the sara lee direct selling businesses in  debt service and its dividend 
as noted above  a majority of the acquisition was funded through new borrowings 
while the payment of a dividend on common shares is a discretionary decision made on a quarterly basis  in the absence of a significant event requiring cash  the company has no current expectation of altering the dividend level as projected cash flows from operations as well as additional property sales are expected to be sufficient to maintain the dividend without restricting the company s ability to finance its operations  make necessary investments in the future growth of the business or its near term debt repayment obligations 
if there is an event requiring the use of cash  such as a strategic acquisition  the company would need to reevaluate whether to maintain its current dividend payout

application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed amounts 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains current and long term receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and sales force in certain markets 
the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
it is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects  particularly related to the evaluation of the recoverability of long term amounts due 
this evaluation is performed market by market and account by account based upon historical experience  market penetration levels  access to alternative channels and similar factors 
it also considers collateral of the customer that could be recovered to satisfy debts 
based upon the results of this analysis  for this risk the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
this analysis requires the company to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon estimates of future demand 
the demand is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the projected success of promotional programs  new product introductions and new markets or distribution channels 
the company prepares projections of demand on an item by item basis for all of its products 
if inventory quantity exceeds projected demand  the excess inventory is written down 
however  if actual demand is less than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of the change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
an assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets 
this assessment requires estimates as to future operating results as well as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company s tax planning strategies 
these estimates are made based upon the company s business plans and growth strategies in each market and are made on an ongoing basis  consequently  future material changes in the valuation allowance are possible 
any change in valuation allowance amounts is reflected in the period in which the change occurs 
at the end of  the company had net domestic deferred tax assets of approximately million against which a valuation allowance of million has been provided 
of this total  approximately million relates to recurring type temporary differences which reverse regularly and are replaced by newly originated items 
the balance is primarily related to foreign tax credits and federal and state net operating losses that are expected to be realized prior to expiration based upon an increase in domestic income from beauticontrol north america as well as expected improvement in the tupperware united states business 
also  expected gains related to the company s previously discussed orlando land sales activities will result in the realization of a portion of these assets 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions are available to the company should they be necessary 
promotional and other accruals 
the company frequently makes promotional offers to its independent sales force to encourage them to meet specific goals or targets for sales levels  party attendance  recruiting or other business critical activities 
the awards offered are in the form of cash  product awards  special prizes or trips 
the cost of these awards is recorded during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award 
these accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred 
the company makes these estimates on a market by market and program by program basis 
it considers the historical success of similar programs  current market trends and perceived enthusiasm of the sales force when the program is launched 
during the promotion qualification period  actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when known 
like the promotional accruals  other accruals are recorded at a time when the liability is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
adjustments to amounts previously accrued are made when changes in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual occur 

table of contents valuation of goodwill 
the company s recorded goodwill relates primarily to that generated by its acquisition of beauticontrol in october and the acquired units in december the company conducts an annual impairment test of its recorded goodwill in the second and third quarter of each year related to the beauticontrol and the acquired units  respectively 
additionally  in the event of a change in circumstances that would lead the company to believe that a triggering event for impairment may have occurred  a test would be completed at that time 
the valuation of its goodwill is dependent upon the estimated fair market value of its beauticontrol operations both in north america and internationally and the operations of the acquired units 
the company estimates the fair value of its beauticontrol and acquired units operations using discounted future cash flow estimates 
such a valuation requires the company to make significant estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows including projections of revenue  costs  utilization of assets and capital requirements 
it also requires estimates in allocating the goodwill to the different segments that include beauticontrol operations beauticontrol north america  asia pacific and mexico and the acquired units operations europe  asia pacific and international beauty 
lastly  it requires estimates as to the appropriate discounting rates to be used 
the results of the reviews conducted to date related to beauticontrol and the acquired units indicate fair values in excess of the carrying values of the respective business operations 
the most sensitive estimate in this evaluation is the projection of operating cash flows as these provide the basis for the fair market valuation 
if operating cash flows were to be more than percent worse than projected  the company would need to calculate a potential impairment as it relates to beauticontrol operations in mexico and the acquired units operations at nutrimetics  naturcare and the south african beauty units 
in beauticontrol and the remaining acquired units operations  a reduction of operating cash flows of more than percent would be required to necessitate calculating a potential impairment 
a significant impairment would have an adverse impact on the company s net income and could result in a lack of compliance with the company s debt covenants 
other intangible assets 
the company recorded as assets the fair value of various trademarks and trade names of million in conjunction with its purchase of the acquired units 
these amounts have an indefinite life and will be evaluated for impairment as discussed in goodwill valuation above 
additionally  the company recorded million for valuation of the acquired units sales forces  and million for product formulations 
the estimated aggregate annual amortization expense associated with the above intangibles for each of the five succeeding years is million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
retirement obligations 
the company s employee pension and other post employment benefits health care costs and obligations are dependent on its assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include health care cost trend rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
the health care cost trend assumptions are based upon historical results  the near term outlook and an assessment of long term trends 
the salary growth assumptions reflect the company s historical experience and outlook 
the long term return on plan assets are based upon historical results of the plan and investment market overall  as well as the company s belief as to the future returns to be earned over the life of the plans 
the discount rate is based upon current yields of aa rated corporate long term bond yields 
the company s key assumptions and funding expectations are indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of the company amended its domestic retiree medical plan effective april  prior to the effective date but after january   the company subsidized the cost of health care for retirees based on age and years of service 
for under age retirees  the amendment altered the company s contribution from a percent of cost to a fixed amount 
for over age retirees  the amendment lowered the fixed subsidy amount 
for former associates retired prior to january  and under the age of  the amendment introduced a monthly premium charge of per covered adult 
the change resulted in a decrease of expense of million in and is expected to decrease the annual cost by approximately million in and thereafter 

table of contents effective december   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this statement requires employers to recognize in their balance sheets the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post retirement plans  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
employers must recognize the change in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive income 
this statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employers balance sheet date 
prior to the adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 the company accounted for its defined benefit post retirement plans under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
sfas no 
required that a liability minimum pension liability be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation abo liability exceeded the fair value of plan assets 
any adjustment was recorded as a non cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
sfas no 
required that the liability recorded should represent the actuarial present value of all future benefits attributable to an employee s service rendered to date 
under both sfas no 
and no 
 changes in the funded status were not immediately recognized  rather they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods 
upon adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 the company recognized the amounts of prior changes in the funded status of its post retirement benefit plans through accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for  the company increased its health care cost trend rate to percent for all participants grading down to percent in this change represented an increase of one percentage point for post age participants and three percentage points for pre age participants 
as a result  pretax expense related to the company s post employment health care plan increased approximately million 
unrecognized losses on post employment plans as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements are not expected to result in a material increase of pretax expense as compared with that of effective june   the company froze the accrual of benefits to participants under its domestic defined benefit pension plans 
this action necessitated a re measurement of its accumulated benefit obligation under the plans and resulted in a pretax increase of million million after tax 
this change resulted in the elimination of the service cost component of net periodic pension expense as it relates to these plans and an ongoing annual reduction of approximately million or about million as compared with due to an excess of lump sum retirement distributions from its domestic pension plans as compared with service and interest costs  the company recorded a settlement charge of approximately million in in conjunction with the benefit freeze  the company increased its basic contribution related to one of its domestic defined contribution plans from percent of eligible employee compensation up to the social security wage base to percent 
impact of inflation inflation as measured by consumer price indices has continued at a low level in most of the countries in which the company operates 
new pronouncements refer to discussion of new pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents market risk one of the company s market risks is its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes 
the company has elected to manage this risk through the maturity structure of its borrowings  interest rate swaps  the currencies in which it borrows and the interest rate lock described below 
the company has previously set a target  over time  of having approximately half of its borrowings with fixed rates based either on the stated terms or through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
as discussed earlier  the company s post acquisition term debt carries a variable interest rate  but requires the company to maintain a fixed interest rate on at least percent of total debt during the term of the loan 
the company entered into swap agreements in december and january to fix the rate on million of its debt for at least three years from the date of the contracts at a rate of approximately percent 
if short term interest rates varied by percent the company s annual interest expense would be impacted by approximately million 
the company had intended to refinance its million notes when they came due in to protect itself from the risk of higher interest rates  in march  the company entered into an agreement to lock in a fixed year treasury rate of approximately percent that would provide the base interest for the debt to be issued in the refinancing 
this derivative was designated as a cash flow hedge and was recorded at its fair value on a quarterly basis 
in light of the refinancing necessary for the acquisition  the agreement was terminated since it was no longer an effective hedge 
this action resulted in a charge of million in interest expense during the third quarter of during  the company entered an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of billion japanese yen that matured on january  the company paid a fixed rate payment of percent semi annually and received a japanese yen floating rate payment based on the libor rate which is determined two days before each interest payment date 
at inception the company believed that this agreement would provide a valuable economic hedge against rising interest rates in japan by converting the variable interest rate implicit in the company s rolling net equity hedges in japan to a fixed rate 
the balance of net equity hedges in japan was reduced with a large reduction occurring in the second quarter of the company  however  maintained the interest rate swap agreement until maturity 
this agreement did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  changes in the market value of the swap were recorded as a component of net interest expense as incurred 
as of december   the cumulative loss was about million  which was fully recognized in a significant portion of the company s sales and profit comes from its international operations 
although these operations are geographically dispersed  which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries  the company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations 
these risks include local political and economic environments  and relations between foreign and us governments 
another economic risk of the company is exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of the company s international operations 
the company is not able to project in any meaningful way the possible effect of these fluctuations on translated amounts or future earnings 
this is due to the company s constantly changing exposure to various currencies  the fact that all foreign currencies do not react in the same manner in relation to the us dollar and the large number of currencies involved  although the company s most significant exposures are to the euro and mexican peso 
although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the company s local product sourcing in many markets  a strengthening us dollar generally has a negative impact on the company 
in response to this fact  the company uses financial instruments  such as forward contracts  to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks associated with a portion of its investment in international operations 
in addition to hedging against the balance sheet impact of changes in exchange rates  the hedge of investments in international operations also has the effect of hedging a portion of cash flows from those operations 
the company also hedges with these instruments certain other exposures to various currencies arising from amounts payable and receivable  non permanent intercompany loans and forecasted purchases 

table of contents during the first quarter of  the company expects to enter into a series of new forward contracts that will significantly reduce interest expense in the future by selling forward and additional million of japanese yen and million of euro 
the forward contracts will deemed to be net equity hedges under the guidelines provided by sfas  and will effectively convert a larger portion of the company s us dollar denominated debt into euro and japanese yen 
this action is expected to reduce interest expense during by approximately million 
it will increase the risk to the company s cash flow  as the settlement at maturity of these new forward contracts will be impacted by changes in exchange rates but be mitigated somewhat by allowing the company to settle debt effectively in currencies generating a greater proportion of its operating cash flows 
during the first quarter of  the company will begin hedging million worth of its yen net equity and million of its euro net equity through a series of new forward contracts 
this will significantly reduce interest expense in the future with an approximate million impact in the initial forward contracts will mature in and and will be settled in cash such that the company will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of the yen and euro versus the us dollar 
over time  this exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the value of operating cash flows generated in the yen and the euro 
the company continuously monitors its foreign currency exposure and may enter into additional contracts to hedge exposure in the future 
see further discussion regarding the company s hedging activities for foreign currency in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is also exposed to rising material prices in its manufacturing operations and in particular the cost of oil and natural gas based resins 
this is the primary material used in production of tupperware products  and totaled about million in a percent fluctuation in the cost of resin could therefore impact the company s annual cost of sales in the eight to nine million dollar range as compared with the prior year 
the company manages this risk by utilizing a centralized procurement function that is able to take advantage of bulk discounts while maintaining multiple suppliers and also enters into short term pricing arrangements 
it also manages its margin through the pricing of its products  with price increases generally in line with consumer inflation  and its mix of sales through its promotional programs and discount offers 
it may also  on occasion  make advance material purchases to take advantage of what it perceives to be favorable pricing 
at this point in time  the company has determined that entering forward contracts for resin prices is not cost beneficial and has no such contracts in place 
however  should circumstances warrant  the company may consider such contracts in the future 
the company s program to sell land held for development is also exposed to the risks inherent in the real estate development process 
included among these risks are the ability to obtain all government approvals  the success of buyers in attracting tenants for commercial developments in the orlando real estate market and general economic conditions  such as interest rate increases
