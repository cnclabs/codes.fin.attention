these include higher solar cell efficiency allowing for greater conversion of light into electricity  an increased ability to benefit from use in solar concentrator systems  ability to withstand high heat environments and reduced overall footprint 
our photovoltaics segment primary targets the following markets satellite solar power generation 
we are a leader in providing solar power generation solutions to the global communications satellite industry and us government space programs 
a satellite s operational success and corresponding revenue depend on its available power and its capacity to transmit data 
we manufacture advanced compound semiconductor based solar cell and solar panel products  which are more resistant to radiation levels in space and generate substantially more power from sunlight than silicon based solutions 
space power systems using our multi junction solar cells weigh less per unit of power than traditional silicon based solar cells 
these performance characteristics increase satellite useful life  increase satellites transmission capacity and reduce launch costs 
our products provide our customers with higher light to power conversion efficiency for reduced size and launch costs  higher radiation tolerance  and longer lifetime in harsh space environments 
we design and manufacture multi junction compound semiconductor based solar cells for both commercial and military satellite applications 
we currently manufacture and sell one of the most efficient and reliable  radiation resistant advanced triple junction solar cells in the world  with an average beginning of life efficiency of 
in may  emcore announced that it has attained solar conversion efficiency of for an entirely new class of advanced multi junction solar cells optimized for space applications

we can provide satellite manufacturers with proven integrated satellite power solutions that considerably improve satellite economics 
satellite manufacturers and solar array integrators rely on emcore to meet their satellite power needs with our proven flight heritage 

table of contents terrestrial solar power generation 
solar power generation systems use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight to electricity and have been used in space programs and  to a lesser extent  in terrestrial applications for several decades 
the market for terrestrial solar power generation solutions has grown significantly as solar power generation technologies improve in efficiency  as global prices for non renewable energy sources ie  fossil fuels continue to rise  and as concern has increased regarding the effect of carbon emissions on global warming 
terrestrial solar power generation has emerged as one of the most rapidly expanding renewable energy sources due to certain advantages solar power holds over other energy sources  including reduced environmental impact  elimination of fuel price risk  installation flexibility  scalability  distributed power generation ie  electric power is generated at the point of use rather than transmitted from a central station to the user  and reliability 
the rapid increase in demand for solar power has created a growing need for highly efficient  reliable and cost effective solar power concentrator systems 
emcore has adapted its high efficiency compound semiconductor based gaas solar cell products for terrestrial applications  which are intended for use with solar concentrator systems in utility scale installations 
in august  emcore announced that it has obtained peak conversion efficiency on its terrestrial concentrating solar cell products currently in volume production 
this compares favorably to typical efficiency of on silicon based solar cells and for competing multi junction concentrating solar cells 
we believe that solar concentrator systems assembled using our compound semiconductor based solar cells will be competitive with silicon based solar power generation systems because they are more efficient and  when combined with the advantages of concentration  we believe will result in a lower cost of power generated 
our multi junction solar cell technology is not subject to silicon shortages  which have led to increasing prices in the raw materials required for silicon based solar cells 
while the terrestrial power generation market is still developing  we have already fulfilled production orders for one solar concentrator company  and provided samples to several others  including major system manufacturers in europe and asia 
we are committed to the ongoing evaluation of strategic opportunities that can expand our addressable markets and strengthen our competitive position 
where appropriate  we will acquire additional products  technologies  or businesses that are complementary to  or broaden the markets in which we operate 
we plan to pursue strategic acquisitions  investments  and partnerships to increase revenue and allow for higher overhead absorption that will improve our gross margins

emcore is committed to achieving profitability by increasing revenue through the introduction of new products  reducing our cost structure and lowering the breakeven points of our product lines 
we have significantly streamlined our manufacturing operations by focusing on core competencies to identify cost efficiencies 
where appropriate  we transferred the manufacturing of certain product lines to low cost contract manufacturers when we can lower costs and maintain quality and reliability 

table of contents in may  emcore announced the opening of a new manufacturing facility in langfang  china 
our new company  langfang emcore optoelectronics co 
ltd  is located approximately miles southeast of beijing and currently occupies a space of  square feet with a class  clean room for optoelectronic device packaging 
another  square feet is available for future expansion 
we have begun the transfer of our most cost sensitive optoelectronic devices to this facility 
this facility  along with a strategic alignment with our existing contract manufacturing partners  should enable us to improve our cost structure and gross margins 
we also expect to develop and provide improved service to our global customers using a local presence in asia 
emcore s restructuring programs are designed to further reduce the number of manufacturing facilities  in addition to the divesture or exit from selected businesses and product lines that were not strategic and or were not capable of achieving desired revenue or profitability goals 
recent divestitures and facility consolidations include in august  we announced the consolidation of our north american fiber optics engineering and design centers into our main operating sites 
emcore s engineering facilities in virginia  illinois  and northern california have been consolidated into larger manufacturing sites in albuquerque  new mexicoand alhambra  california 
the consolidation of these engineering sites should allow emcore to leverage resources within engineering  new product introduction  and customer service

our results of operations and financial condition have and will continue to be significantly affected by severance  restructuring charges  impairment of long lived assets and idle facility expenses incurred during facility closing activities 
please refer to risk factors under item a and financial statements and supplemental data under item for further discussion of these items 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
management develops estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the best information available 
emcore s reported financial position or results of operations may be materially different under changed conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions  particularly with respect to significant accounting policies  which are discussed below 
in the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
emcore s most significant estimates relate to accounts receivable  inventory  goodwill  intangibles  other long lived assets  warranty accruals  revenue recognition  and valuation of stock based compensation 
valuation of accounts receivable 
emcore regularly evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable and accordingly maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us 
the allowance is based on the age of receivables and a specific identification of receivables considered at risk 
emcore classifies charges associated with the allowance for doubtful accounts as sg a expense 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents valuation of inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the standard cost method 
emcore reserves against inventory once it has been determined that i conditions exist that may not allow the inventory to be sold for its intended purpose  ii the inventory s value is determined to be less than cost  or iii the inventory is determined to be obsolete 
the charge related to inventory reserves is recorded as a cost of revenue 
the majority of the inventory reserves are related to estimated allowances for inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value and on excess raw material components resulting from finished product obsolescence 
in most cases where emcore sells previously reserved inventory  it is typically sold as a component part of a finished product 
the finished product is sold at market price at the time resulting in higher average gross margin on such revenue 
emcore does not track the selling price of individual raw material components that have been previously reserved for or written off  since such raw material components usually are an insignificant portion of the resultant finished product and related sales price 
emcore evaluates inventory levels at least quarterly against sales forecasts on a significant part by part basis  in addition to determining its overall inventory risk 
reserves are adjusted to reflect inventory values in excess of forecasted sales  as well as overall inventory risk assessed by management 
we have incurred  and may in the future incur  charges to reserve for and write down our inventory 
while we believe  based on current information  that the amount recorded for inventory is properly reflected on our balance sheet  if market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  our future sales mix differs from our forecasted sales mix  or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates  we may be required to record additional inventory reserves 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business or assets over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
other intangible assets consist primarily of intellectual property that has been internally developed or purchased 
purchased intangible assets include existing and core technology  trademarks and trade names  and customer base and contracts 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight lined method over estimated useful lives ranging from one to fifteen years 
emcore evaluates its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  the likelihood that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed  results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill or intangible assets is necessary involves significant judgment based on the short term and long term projections of the future performance of the reporting unit to which the goodwill or intangible assets are attributed 
as of december   and  emcore tested for impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the fair value of the reporting units was determined by using a valuation technique based on each reporting unit s multiples of revenue 
based on that analysis  we determined that the carrying amount of the reporting units did not exceed their fair value 
during the three months ended september   as part of our quarterly review of financial results  we identified impairment indicators that the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of corona optical systems may not be recoverable 
see note  impairment  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
valuation of long lived assets 
emcore reviews long lived assets on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
a long lived asset is considered impaired when its anticipated undiscounted cash flow is less than its carrying value 
in making this determination  emcore uses certain assumptions  including  but not limited to a estimates of the fair market value of these assets  and b estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service that assets will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
as of december   and  emcore tested for impairment and based on that analysis  we did not record any impairment charges on any of emcore s long lived assets 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided persuasive evidence of a contract exists  such as when a purchase order or contract is received from a customer  the price is fixed  the product meets its specifications  title and ownership have transferred to the customer  and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
in those few instances where a given sale involves post shipment obligations  formal customer acceptance documents  or subjective rights of return  revenue is not recognized until all post shipment conditions have been satisfied and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
the majority of our products have shipping terms that are free on board fob or free carrier alongside fca shipping point  which means that emcore fulfills its delivery obligation when the goods are handed over to the freight carrier at our shipping dock 
this means the buyer bears all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods from that point 
in certain cases  emcore ships its products cost insurance and freight cif 
under this arrangement  revenue is recognized under fca shipping point terms  but emcore pays and bills the customer for the cost of shipping and insurance to the customer s designated location 
emcore accounts for shipping and related transportation costs by recording the charges that are invoiced to customers as revenue  with the corresponding cost recorded as cost of revenue 
in those instances where inventory is maintained at a consigned location  revenue is recognized only when our customer pulls product for its use and title and ownership have transferred to the customer 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized at the contractual rates as labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
emcore also generates service revenue from hardware repairs and calibrations that is recognized as revenue upon completion of the service 
any cost of warranties and remaining obligations that are inconsequential or perfunctory are accrued when the corresponding revenue is recognized 
distributors emcore uses a number of distributors around the world 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  emcore recognizes revenue upon shipment of product to these distributors 
title and risk of loss pass to the distributors upon shipment  and our distributors are contractually obligated to pay emcore on standard commercial terms  just like our other direct customers 
emcore does not sell to its distributors on consignment and  except in the event of product discontinuance  does not give distributors a right of return 
solar panel contracts emcore records revenue from certain solar panel contracts using the percentage of completion method 
revenue is recognized in proportion to actual costs incurred compared to total anticipated costs expected to be incurred for each contract 
if estimates of costs to complete long term contracts indicate a loss  a provision is made for the total loss anticipated 
emcore has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion 
such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
emcore uses all available information in determining dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenue  and contract costs 
estimates are revised as additional information becomes available 
government r d contracts r d contract revenue represents reimbursement by various us government entities  or their contractors  to aid in the development of new technology 
the applicable contracts generally provide that emcore may elect to retain ownership of inventions made in performing the work  subject to a non exclusive license retained by the us government to practice the inventions for governmental purposes 
the r d contract funding may be based on a cost plus  cost reimbursement  or a firm fixed price arrangement 
the amount of funding under each r d contract is determined based on cost estimates that include both direct and indirect costs 
cost plus funding is determined based on actual costs plus a set margin 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record revenue 
contract costs include material  labor  special tooling and test equipment  subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
an r d contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred  milestones have been reached  and any reporting obligations to the customer have been met 
government contract revenue is primarily recognized as service revenue 
emcore also has certain cost sharing r d arrangements 
under such arrangements in which the actual costs of performance are divided between the us government and emcore  no revenue is recorded and the company s r d expense is reduced for the amount of the cost sharing receipts 
the us government may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance measurements 
if any of our government contracts were to be terminated for convenience  we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs 
if any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default  generally the us government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re procure the contract items  net of the work accepted from the original contract 
the us government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default 

table of contents product warranty reserves 
emcore provides its customers with limited rights of return for non conforming shipments and warranty claims for certain products 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  emcore makes estimates of product warranty expense using historical experience rates as a percentage of revenue and accrues estimated warranty expense as a cost of revenue 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our historical experience of known product failure rates  use of materials to repair or replace defective products and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
stock based compensation 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model and the straight line attribution approach to determine the fair value of stock based awards under sfas r  share based payment revised 
the company elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r and accordingly prior periods were not restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock based compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is rendered beginning on october   the first day of the company s fiscal year for purposes of pro forma disclosure  stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to october  is measured on the grant date fair value as determined under the provisions of sfas the option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
emcore s expected term represents the period that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock based awards 
the expected stock price volatility is based on emcore s historical stock prices

as of september   we had an order backlog based on future billings of approximately million as compared to a backlog of approximately million from the prior year 
the september  order backlog is comprised of million for our photovoltaics segment and million for our fiber optics segment 
within our photovoltaics segment  million relates to our satellite solar power business and million relates to our terrestrial solar power business 
the significant increase in order backlog is attributable to the receipt of long term photovoltaics related sales contracts  of which approximately million is scheduled for shipment after calendar year emcore had been engaged in a multi year cost reimbursable solar cell development and production contract for a major usaerospace corporation 
it was previously reported that the contract would exceed million in development and production revenue over the next several years 
although we recognized significant revenue for this program during fiscal  our customer notified us in august that their program had been terminated for convenience by the us government 
we adjusted our order backlog accordingly and this will have no effect on our fiscal revenue guidance 
in fiscal  we expect to recognize additional revenue from this program related to contract termination costs 
we also expect revenue in fiscal from a new us government contract that has similar technical contract requirements 
a majority of our fiber optics products typically ship within the same quarter as when the purchase order is received  therefore  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period

table of contents fiber optics over the past several years  communications networks have experienced dramatic growth in data transmission traffic due to worldwide internet access  e mail  and e commerce 
as internet content expands to include full motion video on demand  hdtv  multi channel high quality audio  online video conferencing  image transfer  online multi player gaming  and other broadband applications  the delivery of such data will place a greater demand on available bandwidth and require the support of higher capacity networks 
the bulk of this traffic  which continues to grow at a very high rate  is already routed through the optical networking infrastructure used by local and long distance carriers  as well as internet service providers 
optical fiber offers substantially greater bandwidth capacity  is less error prone  and is easier to administer than older copper wire technologies 
as greater bandwidth capability is delivered closer to the end user  increased demand for higher content  real time  interactive visual and audio content is expected 
we believe that emcore is well positioned to benefit from the continued deployment of these higher capacity fiber optic networks 
customers for the fiber optics segment include avago technologies  inc  alcatel  aurora networks  bupt guoan broadband  c cor electronics  cisco  finisar  hewlett packard corporation  intel corporation  jabil  jdsu  motorola  network appliance  sycamore networks  inc  and tellabs

also  despite higher revenue for this segment  revenue from our legacy products that serve the digital fiber optics sector were lower than last year due to customer inventory management and increased competition 
the communications industry in which we participate continues to be dynamic 
the driving factor is the competitive environment that exists between cable operators  telephone companies  and satellite and wireless service providers 
each are rapidly investing capital to deploy a converging multi service network capable of delivering triple play services  ie video  voice and data content  bundled as a service provided by a single communication provider 
as a market leader in rf transmission over fiber products for the catv industry  emcore enables cable companies to offer multiple forms of communications to meet the expanding demand for high speed internet  on demand and interactive video  and other new services such as hdtv and voip 
television is also undergoing a major transformation  as the us government requires television stations to broadcast exclusively in digital format  abandoning the analog format used for decades 
although the transition date for digital transmissions is not expected for several years  the build out of these television networks has already begun 
to support the telephone companies plan to offer competing video  voice and data services through the deployment of new fiber based systems  emcore has developed and maintains customer qualified fttp components and subsystem products 
our catv and fttp products include broadcast analog and digital fiber optic transmitters  quadrature amplitude modulation qam transmitters  video receivers  and passive optical network pon transceivers

photovoltaics emcore is a leader in providing solar power generation solutions to the global communications satellite industry and us government space programs 
emcore manufactures advanced compound semiconductor based solar cell products and solar panels  which are more resistant to radiation levels in space and convert substantially more power from sunlight than silicon based solutions 
emcore s photovoltaics segment designs and manufactures multi junction compound semiconductor based solar cells for both commercial and military satellite applications 
customers for the photovoltaics segment include boeing  general dynamics  green and gold energy  indian space research organization isro  lockheed martin  and space systems loral

table of contents we see additional areas for growth resulting from the joint venture between isro and eads astrium for the manufacture of geo communication satellites 
emcore is a leading supplier of solar cell products to isro  and we anticipate increased activity with that customer 
government and military procurement remains steady  and we have recently been awarded solar panel government contracts for military and science missions  and this represents an expansion of our customer base 
emcore had been engaged in a multi year cost reimbursable solar cell development and production contract for a major usaerospace corporation 
it was previously reported that the contract would exceed million in development and production revenue over the next several years 
although we recognized significant revenue for this program during fiscal  our customer notified us in august that their program had been terminated for convenience by the us government 
we adjusted our order backlog accordingly and this will have no effect on our fiscal revenue guidance 
in fiscal  we expect to recognize additional revenue from this program related to contract termination costs 
we also expect revenue in fiscal from a new us government contract that has similar technical contract requirements 
in august  emcore was awarded a follow on production order from green and gold energy gge for three million solar cells for use in gge s suncubetm terrestrial concentrator system 
this mw purchase order represents a follow on order to an initial mw order placed earlier in all hardware ordered under this contract is to be shipped by december on november   emcore announced that its photovoltaics division had been awarded a multi year purchase order from a leading manufacturer of high power geosynchronous communications satellites 
emcore estimates the expected revenue from the purchase order at more than million over a period of years 
emcore will supply state of the art  high efficiency multi junction solar cells for approximately ten high power satellites 
production of the solar cells will take place at emcore s state of the art multi junction solar cell production facility located in albuquerque  new mexico 
the recently awarded purchase order represents an extension to an existing multi year purchasing agreement with a leading us commercial satellite manufacturer 
the agreement calls for continuous solar cell production through with several hundred thousand solar cells to be delivered to the end customer 
in february  emcore was awarded a subcontract to participate in the defense research projects agency darpa very high efficiency solar cell vhsec program to more than double the efficiency of terrestrial solar cells within the next fifty months 
emcore was selected by the university of delaware  the prime contractor for the darpa vhsec program  to develop advanced iii v multi junction solar cells in phase i of the program effort 
the vhsec program will provide up to million in funding  which will be awarded to program participants in various phases over the next several years 
gross profit gross profit increased million or to million from million in the prior year

on a segment basis  margins for fiber optics decreased slightly from to primarily due to unabsorbed overhead as a result of lower revenue from our legacy products that serve the digital fiber optics sector 
margins for the photovoltaics segment increased from to 
this increase was due to increased revenues and improved product mix  a shift to generally higher margin products along with higher overhead absorption 
in october  emcore consolidated its solar panel manufacturing into a state of the art facility located in albuquerque  new mexico 
the establishment of a modern solar panel manufacturing facility  adjacent to our solar cell fabrication operations  facilitates consistency  as well as reduces manufacturing costs 
actions designed to improve our gross margins through product mix improvements  cost reductions associated with product transfers and product rationalization  maximizing production yields on high performance devices and quality improvements  among other things continue to be a principal focus for us 
we focus our activities on developing new process control and yield management tools that enable us to accelerate the adoption of new technologies into full volume production  while minimizing their associated risks

research and development 
our r d efforts have been sharply focused to maintain our technological leadership position by working to improve the quality and attributes of our product lines 
we also invest significant resources to develop new products and production technology to expand into new market opportunities by leveraging our existing technology base and infrastructure 
our efforts are focused on designing new proprietary processes and products  on improving the performance of our existing materials  components  and subsystems  and on reducing costs in the product manufacturing process 
in addition to using our internal capacity to develop and manufacture products for our target markets  emcore continues to expand its portfolio of products and technologies through acquisitions 
r d expenses increased million or to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in r d is due to million of r d expenses incurred at our new terrestrial solar power division 
as a percentage of revenue  r d increased to from reported in prior period 
we believe that recently completed r d projects have the potential to greatly improve our competitive position and drive revenue growth in the next few years 
as part of the ongoing effort to cut costs  many of our projects are to develop lower cost versions of our existing products and of our existing processes  while improving quality 
also  we have implemented a program to focus research and product development efforts on projects that we expect to generate returns within one year 
as a result  over the last several years  emcore has reduced overall r d costs as a percentage of revenue without  we believe  jeopardizing future revenue opportunities 
our technology and product leadership is an important competitive advantage 
driven by current and anticipated demand  we will continue to invest in new technologies and products that offer our customers increased efficiency  higher performance  improved functionality  and or higher levels of integration 
in fiscal  we expect r d spending as a percentage of revenue to decrease after our second generation concentrator photovoltaic cpv system is transferred from r d to production

quantitative andqualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
currency exchange rates 
although emcore enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies from time to time  the total amount of such transactions is not material 
accordingly  fluctuations in foreign currency values would not have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
however  some of our foreign suppliers may adjust their prices in us from time to time to reflect currency exchange fluctuations  and such price changes could impact our future financial condition or results of operations 
the company does have a subsidiary located in china 
due to the relative volume of transactions through this subsidiary  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
the company does not currently hedge its foreign currency exposure 
interest rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio in a variety of high grade aaa  short term debt and money market instruments  which carry a minimal degree of interest rate risk 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may be slightly less than expected because of changes in interest rates  or we may suffer insignificant losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
the company does not currently hedge its interest rate exposure
