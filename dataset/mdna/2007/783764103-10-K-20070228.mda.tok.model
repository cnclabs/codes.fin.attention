overview results of operations during  the homebuilding industry continued to experience a softening of demand for new homes 
over the last several years  the price appreciation of homes was relatively high in most markets and  in turn  attracted speculation

critical accounting policies preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the use of judgment in the application of accounting policies and estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
listed below are those policies that management believes are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
management has discussed the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure 
there are items within the financial statements that require estimation  but are not considered critical 
share based payments on january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r share based payment  which requires that compensation expense be measured and recognized at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements 
the company calculates the fair value of stock options by using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected dividend yield and the expected stock option exercise behavior 
additionally  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to forfeit 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company s consolidated results of operations could be materially impacted 
the company believes the accounting for stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy because it requires the use of complex judgment in its application 
use of estimates in budgeting land acquisitions  development and homebuilding construction costs associated with real estate projects  the company evaluates market conditions  material and labor costs  buyer preferences  construction timing  and provisions for insurance and warranty obligations 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for resolution of legal claims 
estimates  which are based on historical experience and other assumptions  are reviewed continually  updated when necessary and believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes that the timing and scope of its evaluation procedures are proper and adequate 
changes in assumptions relating to such factors  however  could have a material effect on the company s results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period 
income recognition revenues and cost of sales are recorded at the time each home or lot is closed  title and possession are transferred to the buyer and there is no significant continuing involvement in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for sales of real estate 
in order to match revenues with related expenses  land  land development  interest  taxes and other related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future are allocated to the cost of homes closed  based upon the relative sales value basis of the total number of homes to be constructed in each community  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
estimated land  common area development and related costs of planned communities including the cost of amenities are allocated to individual parcels or communities on a relative sales value basis 
changes to estimated costs  subsequent to the commencement of the delivery of homes  are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
inventory valuation housing projects and land held for development inventory and sale are stated at either the lower of cost or net realizable value 
inventory includes land and development costs  direct construction costs  capitalized indirect construction costs  capitalized interest  and real estate taxes 
it may take one to three years to develop  sell and deliver all of the homes in a typical community 
the company assesses these assets for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that long lived assets and assets held for sale be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of housing inventories is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or by the sales of comparable assets 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less selling costs 
these evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues  costs and expenses  as well as by other factors 
in addition  land  or costs related to future communities  whether owned or under option  is reviewed to determine if the company will proceed with development and if all related costs are recoverable 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and is recognized within the same period that it is identified 
management believes its processes are designed to properly assess market and carrying values of assets 
variable interest entities fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to the majority of the entity s expected losses and or receives a majority of the entity s expected returns as a result of ownership  contractual agreements or other financial interests in the entity 
fin also requires disclosure about variable interest entities vies that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant  though not primary  variable interest 
the company enters into joint ventures  from time to time  for the purpose of acquisition and co development of land parcels and lots
