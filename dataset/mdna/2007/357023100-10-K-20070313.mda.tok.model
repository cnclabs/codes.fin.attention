item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements 
we are the leading manufacturer of aluminum bodied railcars and coal carrying railcars in north america  based on the number of railcars delivered 
we also refurbish and rebuild railcars and sell forged  cast and fabricated parts for the railcars we produce  as well as those manufactured by others 
we have chosen not to offer significant railcar leasing services  as we have made a strategic decision not to compete with our customers that provide railcar leasing services  which represent a significant portion of our revenue 
our primary customers are financial institutions  railroads  and shippers 
our manufacturing facilities are located in danville  illinois  johnstown  pennsylvania and roanoke  virginia 
all of our manufacturing facilities have the capability to manufacture a variety of types of railcars 
in the twelve months ended december   we delivered  new railcars  compared to our delivery of  new railcars in the twelve months ended december  our total backlog of firm orders for new railcars decreased by approximately  from  railcars as of december  to  railcars as of december  the backlog as of december  represented estimated sales of million  while the backlog as of december  represented estimated sales of  million 
approximately of our backlog as of december  consisted of coal carrying railcars 

table of contents prices for steel and aluminum  the primary raw material components of our railcars  and surcharges on steel and railcar components remain at historically high levels 
notwithstanding fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  a significant majority of the contracts covering our current backlog include provisions that allow for variable pricing to protect us against future changes in the cost of raw materials 
we were able to pass on increased material costs to our customers with respect to approximately of our railcar deliveries in with respect to the supply of components  while the availability of railcar components improved during  the railcar industry continues to be adversely impacted by shortages of wheels and other components as a result of reorganization and consolidation of domestic suppliers  increased demand for new railcars and railroad maintenance requirements 
currently  we believe that these shortages will not significantly impact our ability to meet our delivery requirements as domestic suppliers have improved their delivery capabilities 
the north american railcar market is highly cyclical and the trends in the railcar industry are closely related to the overall level of economic activity 
we expect railroads and utilities to continue to upgrade their fleets of aging steel bodied coal carrying railcars to lighter and more durable aluminum bodied coal carrying railcars 
despite the decline in our backlog  we believe that the long term outlook for railcar demand is positive  due to increased rail traffic and the replacement of aging railcar fleets 
we also believe that the long term outlook for our business  including the demand for our coal carrying railcars  is positive  based on our long term supply agreements  our expanding product portfolio  our operational efficiency in manufacturing railcars and our international opportunities 
however  us economic conditions may not continue to improve in the future or result in a sustained economic recovery  and our business is subject to these and significant other risks that may cause our current positive outlook to change

risk factors 
in april  we completed an initial public offering of shares of our common stock 
in connection with the offering  we offered and sold  shares of our common stock and certain selling stockholders offered and sold  shares including  shares following the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option at a price of per share 
our net proceeds from the initial public offering  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and estimated offering related expenses payable by us  were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds from the offering and our available cash to repay our existing indebtedness  redeem all of our outstanding redeemable preferred stock  pay amounts due under the rights to additional acquisition consideration  pay amounts due in connection with the termination of certain management services and other agreements with certain of our stockholders and pay related fees and expenses 
see liquidity and capital resources 
in september  we completed a secondary offering of our common stock whereby the selling stockholders  including all of our executive officers and certain of our directors  offered and sold  shares including  shares following the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option at a price of per share 
we did not sell any shares and did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders 
we incurred million of expenses in connection with the secondary offering 
in january  our board of directors announced a share repurchase program of up to million 
these shares are to be purchased in the open market beginning in the first quarter of financial statement presentation sales our sales are generated primarily from sales of the railcars that we manufacture 
our sales depend on industry demand for new railcars  which is driven by overall economic conditions and the demand for railcar transportation of various products  such as coal  motor vehicles  steel products  forest products  minerals  cement and agricultural commodities 
our sales are also affected by competitive market pressures that impact the prices for our railcars and by the types of railcars sold 
we generally manufacture railcars under firm orders from our customers 
we recognize sales  which we sometimes refer to as deliveries  of new and rebuilt railcars when we complete the individual railcars  the railcars are accepted by the customer following inspection  the risk of any damage or other loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer and title to the railcars transfers to the customer 
with respect to sales transactions involving the trading in of used railcars  in accordance with accounting rules  we recognize sales for the entire transaction when the cash 
table of contents consideration received is in excess of of the total transaction value and on a pro rata portion of the total transaction value when the cash consideration received is less than of the total transaction value 
we value used railcars received at their estimated fair market value less a normal profit margin 
there were no sales of used railcars for the year ended december  sales of used railcars for the years ended december  and  were not material 
the variable purchase patterns of our customers and the timing of completion  delivery and acceptance of customer orders may cause our sales and income from operations to vary substantially each quarter  which will result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials such as aluminum and steel  as well as the cost of finished railcar components  such as castings  wheels  truck components and couplers  and other specialty components 
our cost of sales also includes labor  utilities  freight  manufacturing depreciation and other manufacturing overhead costs 
factors that have affected our cost of sales include the recent increases in the cost of steel and aluminum and our efforts to lower manufacturing costs in our johnstown  pennsylvania facility and to reduce the costs of new products that we have recently introduced 
we purchase  and we believe most of our competitors purchase  a substantial percentage of wheels and other railcar components from subsidiaries of amsted industries inc for the year ended december   due to a shortage of wheels and other railcar components from amsted industries  our deliveries were limited to  railcars  even though we had orders and production capacity to manufacture more railcars 
the limited supply of wheels and other railcar components did not impact our deliveries for the years ended december  and while the availability of railcar components has continued to improve during  the railcar industry continues to be adversely impacted by shortages of wheels and other components as a result of reorganization and consolidation of domestic suppliers  increased demand for new railcars and railroad maintenance requirements 
currently  we believe that these shortages will not significantly impact our ability to meet our delivery requirements as domestic suppliers have improved their delivery capabilities 
customer orders may be subject to cancellation  customer requests for delays in railcar deliveries  inspection rights and other customary industry terms and conditions 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to the railcar industry limitations on the supply of wheels and other railcar components could adversely affect our business because they may limit the number of railcars we can manufacture 
the prices for steel and aluminum  the primary raw material inputs of our railcars  increased sharply in and have further increased in and as a result of strong demand  limited availability of production inputs for steel and aluminum  including scrap metal  industry consolidation and import trade barriers 
the costs for raw steel and aluminum have increased by approximately and  respectively  during the period from october through december  the availability of scrap metal has been limited by exports of scrap metal to china  and as a result  steel producers have charged scrap metal surcharges in excess of agreed upon prices 
in addition  the price and availability of other railcar components that are made of steel have been adversely affected by the increased cost and limited availability of steel 
during the year ended december   our gross profit was adversely impacted by non recoverable increases in the cost of materials of approximately million 
during the years ended december  and  our gross profit was adversely impacted by higher costs of approximately million and million  respectively  associated with increased material  labor and other costs related to a contract to manufacture box cars 
for the years ended december  and  we were able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers with respect to and of our railcar deliveries  respectively

table of contents on april   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the revolving credit agreement providing for the terms of our revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with lasalle bank national association  as administrative agent  and the lenders party thereto 
the revolving credit facility replaced our former million revolving credit facility with lasalle bank national association 
the revolving credit facility provides for a million revolving credit line  including a letter of credit sub facility that may not exceed million 
the revolving credit facility has a term of three years 
our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries serve as collateral for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the borrowing base  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  is the lesser of the million revolving commitment or an amount equal to a percentage of eligible accounts receivable plus percentages of eligible finished inventory and eligible semi finished inventory  respectively 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the libor rate plus an applicable margin of between and  which is determined based on the ratio of our consolidated senior debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the revolving credit agreement 
we pay a commitment fee of between per year and per year on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility  million in letters of credit under the letter of credit sub facility and the ability to borrow million under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit agreement has both affirmative and negative covenants  including  without limitation  a maximum senior debt leverage ratio  a maximum total debt leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio  a minimum tangible net worth and limitations on capital expenditures and dividends 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows  together with amounts available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for our long term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance and our ability to continue to meet financial covenants under our revolving credit facility and any other indebtedness 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund organic growth opportunities and cost reduction programs  including new plant and equipment  development of railcars  joint ventures and acquisitions  and these capital requirements could be substantial 
management continuously evaluates manufacturing facility requirements based upon market demand and may elect to make capital investments at higher levels in the future 
we are considering the addition of another manufacturing facility to increase our low cost production capacity 
we are also exploring product diversification initiatives and international and other opportunities 
we expect that these additional business activities may result in capital requirements of approximately million within the next to months  which we expect to fund through cash provided by operating activities 
additionally  we have undertaken a share repurchase program of up to million that we expect to fund through available cash balances 
our long term liquidity needs also depend to a significant extent on our obligations related to our pension and welfare benefit plans 
we provide pension and retiree welfare benefits to certain salaried and hourly employees upon their retirement 
the most significant assumptions used in determining our net periodic benefit costs are the discount rate used on our pension and postretirement welfare obligations and expected return on pension plan assets 
our management expects that any future obligations under our pension plans that are not currently funded will be funded out of our future cash flow from operations 
as of december   our benefit obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement benefit plan was million and million  respectively  which exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million and million  respectively 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we expect to make contributions relating to our defined benefit pension plans of approximately million in however  we may elect to adjust the level of contributions to our pension plans based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments  changes in interest rates and changes in workforce compensation 
in august  president bush signed the pension protection act of into law 
included in this legislation are changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes  as well as minimum funding levels required by we are determining the impact that these new requirements will have on our cash flow  however  initial estimates forecast that our defined benefit pension plans will be fully funded by this expectation will be affected by future contributions  investment returns on plan assets  growth in plan liabilities and interest rates 
assuming that the plan is fully funded as that term is defined within the pension protection act  we will be required to fund the ongoing growth in plan liabilities on an annual basis 
we anticipate funding pension contributions with cash from operations 
based upon our operating performance  capital requirements and obligations under our pension and welfare benefit plans  we may  from time to time  be required to raise additional funds through additional offerings of our common stock and through long term borrowings 
there can be no assurance that long term debt  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect that these obligations and commitments would be expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years after years in thousands capital leases from long term debt operating leases wheel and axle purchases aluminum purchases total wheel and axle purchase commitments consist of a non cancelable agreement with one of our suppliers to purchase materials used in the manufacturing process 
the quantity commitment is partially based on the aluminum coal car industry backlog published by the american railway car institute and the pricing is based on the producer price index 
the estimated amounts above may vary based on the actual quantities and price 
aluminum purchase commitments consist of non cancelable agreements to purchase fixed amounts of materials used in the manufacturing process 
purchase commitments are made at a fixed price and are typically entered into after a customer places an order for railcars 
in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above  we also will have interest payment obligations on any borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also pay consulting fees to one of our directors 
the amount paid for his consulting services was  for each of the years ended december   and the agreement governing this arrangement will expire in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are a party to employment agreements with our president and chief executive officer  our chief operating officer  our vice president  finance  chief financial officer  treasurer and secretary  our vice president  planning and administration  and our senior vice president  marketing and sales 
see item executive compensation 
we are also required to make minimum contributions to our pension and postretirement welfare plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding our expected contributions to our pension plans and our expected postretirement welfare benefit payments for cash flows the following table summarizes our net cash provided by or used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december   and december  december  december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities total 
table of contents operating activities 
our net cash provided by or used in operating activities reflects net income or loss adjusted for non cash charges and changes in net working capital including non current assets and liabilities 
cash flows from operating activities are affected by several factors  including fluctuations in business volume  contract terms for billings and collections  the timing of collections on our contract receivables  processing of bi weekly payroll and associated taxes  and payment to our suppliers 
our working capital accounts also fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of certain events  such as the payment or non payment for our railcars 
as some of our customers accept delivery of new railcars in train set quantities  consisting on average of to railcars  variations in our sales lead to significant fluctuations in our operating profits and cash from operating activities 
we do not usually experience business credit issues  although a payment may be delayed pending completion of closing documentation  and a typical order of railcars may not yield cash proceeds until after the end of a reporting period 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase of million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the addition of million in net income adjusted for non cash items and an increase of million generated by working capital accounts such as accounts receivable and inventories  net of accounts payable  partially offset by the use of million in cash applicable to payroll  pensions and postretirement obligations 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase of million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the addition of million in net income adjusted for non cash items  the additional use of million in cash for accounts receivable and inventories  net of accounts payable  an increase of million in cash applicable to payroll  pensions and postretirement obligations  and the additional use of million of cash for other working capital items

the payments on long term debt included million for the repurchase of the senior notes  million for the repayment of the term loan  and million for the repayment of the industrial revenue bonds 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of long term debt repayments applicable to our term loan and deferred offering costs 

table of contents during the year ended december   in addition to the regular monthly payments of approximately million per month  we made a million balloon payment on our term loan in accordance with the agreement governing the term loan concerning the payment of proceeds from the sale of rebuilt railcars 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   million of the million total capital expenditures were used for the expansion of production capacity at our manufacturing facility in roanoke  virginia 
a second track was added in roanoke to accommodate the manufacture of hybrid stainless steel aluminum coal carrying railcars 
the remaining million of capital expenditures for the year ended december  were comprised primarily of expenditures for machinery and equipment and building improvements at our danville  johnstown and roanoke production facilities 
our capital expenditures were million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   million of the million total capital expenditures was used for the expansion of production capacity at our manufacturing facility in roanoke  virginia 
the remaining million of capital expenditures for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of expenditures for machinery and equipment at our johnstown and danville production facilities 
capital spending for the year ended december  primarily consisted of machinery and equipment expenditures 
excluding unforeseen expenditures  management expects that capital expenditures will be approximately million in these expenditures will be used to maintain our existing facilities and update manufacturing equipment 
management continuously evaluates manufacturing facility requirements based upon market demand and may elect to make capital investments at higher levels in the future 
we are considering the addition of another manufacturing facility to increase our low cost production capacity 
we are also exploring product diversification initiatives and international and other opportunities 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures through cash provided by operating activities 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include long lived assets  goodwill  pension and postretirement benefit assumptions  the valuation reserve on the net deferred tax asset  warranty accrual and contingencies and litigation 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
for assets to be held or used  we group a long lived asset or assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
an impairment loss for an asset group reduces only the carrying amounts of a long lived asset or assets of the group being evaluated 
our estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset group include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
our future cash flow estimates exclude interest charges 
we routinely evaluate our manufacturing footprint to assess our manufacturing capacity and cost of production 
to the extent that a change in our footprint is deemed to be warranted  we will evaluate the impact of this standard at the time of such a decision 
there were no impairment losses on long lived assets recorded during  or 
table of contents impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded on our balance sheet both goodwill and intangible assets  which consist primarily of patents and an intangible asset related to our defined benefit plans 
on december  the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in the derecognition of the intangible asset related to our defined benefit pension plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  goodwill and intangible assets were reviewed for impairment when events or other changes in circumstances had indicated that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we tested all goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on january   january   and january  in accordance with sfas no 
we have not noted any such impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually based on management s assessment of the fair value of our assets as compared to the carrying value of our assets 
additional steps  including an allocation of the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  would be necessary to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment if the fair value of our assets and liabilities were less than their carrying value 
the process of assessing fair value involves management making estimates with respect to future sales volume  pricing  economic and industry data  anticipated cost environment and overall market conditions  and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded  these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
our method to determine fair value to test goodwill for impairment considers three valuation approaches the discounted cash flow method  the guideline company method and the transaction method 
the results of each of these three methods are reviewed by management and a fair value is then assigned 
for our january  valuation date  management estimated that the fair value of our company exceeded the carrying value of our company by a substantial amount 
the discounted cash flow method involves significant judgment based on a market derived rate of return to discount short term and long term projections of the future performance of our company 
the major assumptions that influence future performance include volume projections based on an industry specific outlook for railcar demand and specifically coal railcar demand  estimated margins on railcar sales  and weighted average cost of capital or wacc used to discount future performance of our company 
we use industry data to estimate volume projections in our discounted cash flow method 
we believe that this independent industry data is the best indicator of expected future performance assuming that we maintain a consistent market share  which management believes is supportable based on historical performance 
while a negative adjustment to the volume projections used in the discounted cash flow method would reduce the excess of the fair value of our company compared to its carrying value by approximately  management estimates that the fair value would still exceed the carrying value by a substantial amount 
our estimated margins used in the discounted cash flow method are based primarily on historical margins 
the price of raw materials has increased significantly since november aluminum and steel prices have historically accounted for approximately to of our total cost of sales 
changes in aluminum and steel prices typically only affect margins on signed contracts for railcars forming part of our backlog as management historically has used aluminum and steel prices at the time a contract is signed as the basis for its selling price 
at january   all of our contracts provided for raw material cost escalation and with respect to the year ended december   we were able to pass through to our customers raw material cost increases on of railcar deliveries 
however  there is no assurance that our customers will accept variable pricing in the future  which would subject our margins and performance to variability primarily in the event of changes in the price of aluminum and steel 
while an increase of in aluminum and steel prices for backlog and projected volume in the discounted cash flow method would reduce the excess of the fair value of our company compared to its carrying value by approximately  management estimates that the fair value would still exceed the carrying value by a substantial amount 
the wacc used to discount our future performance in the discounted cash flow method is based on an estimated rate of return of companies in our industry and interest rates for corporate debt rated baa or the equivalent by moody s investors service 
management estimated a wacc of for the january  goodwill impairment 
table of contents valuation analysis based on our mix of equity and debt 
while an increase of in the wacc used in the discounted cash flow method would reduce the excess of the fair value of our company compared to its carrying value by approximately  management estimates that the fair value would still exceed the carrying value by a substantial amount 
the assumptions supporting our estimated future cash flows  including the discount rate used and estimated terminal value  reflect our best estimates 
the guideline company method and transaction method use market valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies for the guideline company method and recent transactions for the transaction method and  as a result  involve less judgment in their application 
impairment of definite lived intangibles is determined to exist when undiscounted cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets 
these cash flow estimates are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and consider all available evidence 
however  there is inherent uncertainty in estimating future cash flows 
pensions and postretirement benefits we provide pension and retiree welfare benefits to certain salaried and hourly employees upon their retirement 
the most significant assumptions used in determining our net periodic benefit costs are the expected return on pension plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our pension and postretirement welfare plan liabilities 
in  we assumed that the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets would be 
as permitted under sfas  the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in our net periodic benefit cost 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future net periodic benefit cost 
we review the expected return on plan assets annually and would revise it if conditions should warrant 
a change of one percentage point in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have the following effect increase decrease in thousands effect on net periodic benefit cost at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of our pension and postretirement welfare plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which our pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   we determined this rate to be  an increase of from the rate used at december  a change of one percentage point in the discount rate would have the following effect increase decrease in thousands effect on net periodic benefit cost for the years ended december   and  we recognized consolidated pre tax pension cost of million  million and million  respectively 
we currently expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plans during however  we may elect to adjust the level of contributions based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments  changes in interest rates and changes in workforce compensation 
in august  president bush signed the pension protection act of into law 
included in this legislation are changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes  as well as minimum funding levels required by we are determining the impact that these new requirements will have on our cash flow  however  initial estimates forecast that our defined benefit pension plans will be fully funded by this expectation will be affected by future contributions  investment returns on plan assets  growth in plan liabilities and interest rates 
assuming that the plan is fully funded as that term is defined within the pension protection act  we will be required to fund the ongoing growth in plan liabilities on an annual basis 
we anticipate funding pension contributions with cash from operations 

table of contents for the years ended december   and  we recognized a consolidated pre tax postretirement welfare benefit cost of million  million and million  respectively 
we currently expect to pay approximately million during in postretirement welfare benefits 
income taxes management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets  liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against the deferred tax assets 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our net deferred tax assets and assess the valuation allowance  adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect our ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  increased competition  a decline in sales or margins and loss of market share 
at december   we had total net deferred tax assets of million 
although realization of our net deferred tax assets is not certain  management has concluded that we will more likely than not realize the full benefit of the deferred tax assets 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million  based on our management s conclusion that it was more likely than not that certain of our net deferred tax assets in pennsylvania would not be realized 
we provide for deferred income taxes based on differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for items that are reported for financial statement purposes in periods different from those for income tax reporting purposes 
the deferred tax liability or asset amounts are based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
the deferred tax liabilities and assets that we record relate to the enacted federal  illinois and virginia tax rates  since net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets arising under pennsylvania state law have been fully reserved 
a change in the rate of federal income taxes would increase or decrease our deferred tax assets by million 
a change in the rate of illinois income taxes would increase or decrease our deferred tax assets by million 
a change in the rate of virginia income taxes would increase or decrease our deferred tax assets by  product warranties we establish a warranty reserve for railcars sold and estimate the amount of the warranty accrual based on the history of warranty claims for the type of railcar  adjusted for significant known claims in excess of established reserves 
warranty terms are based on the negotiated railcar sales contracts and typically are for periods of one to five years 
revenue recognition we generally manufacture railcars under firm orders from third parties 
we recognize revenue on new and rebuilt railcars when we complete the individual railcars  the railcars are accepted by the customer following inspection  the risk for any damage or other loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer and title to the railcars transfers to the customer 
revenue from leasing is recognized ratably during the lease term 
pursuant to accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 interpretations of apb no  on transactions involving used railcar trades  we recognize revenue for the entire transaction when the cash consideration is in excess of of the total transaction value and on a pro rata portion of the total transaction value when the cash consideration is less than of the total transaction value 
we value used railcars received at their estimated fair market value at date of receipt less a normal profit margin 
compensation expense under stock option agreements management judgment is required in estimating the compensation expense under stock option agreements 
during the year ended december   compensation expense was recorded at the estimated fair value of the 
table of contents options to purchase units  consisting of shares of our common stock and one share of our series a voting preferred stock 
on april   we adopted the long term incentive plan  pursuant to which we granted options to purchase shares of our common stock to certain of our executive officers 
determining the compensation expense under stock option agreements requires complex and subjective judgments 
our approach to valuation is based on using market multiples of comparable companies  our cash flows and other data which give management indicators of the fair value of the options 
there is inherent uncertainty in making these estimates 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies related to certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amounts of loss  in the determination of loss contingencies 
we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us based on our ongoing monitoring activities to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted 
if the amount of the actual loss is greater than the amount we have accrued  this would have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments or certain liabilities based upon the entity s equity instruments for goods or services 
the revision to sfas no 
generally requires that publicly traded companies measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective method and  as such  results for prior periods have not been restated 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no

fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the requirements of fin no 
and have not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no

we adopted sfas no 
as of december  on the prospective basis as required 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures required by sfas no 
and the effects of adoption 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard 
additionally  companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding financial instruments in one of the categories  including a separate reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for each major category of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
other than the enhanced disclosures required  we do not expect the provisions of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no

table of contents issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
the sec has stated that sab no 
should be applied no later than for the annual financial statements for the first year ending after november   with earlier application encouraged 
we adopted sab no 
effective as of december  the application of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements including  in particular  statements about our plans  strategies and prospects 
we have used the words may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan  intend and similar expressions in this prospectus to identify forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including the cyclical nature of our business  adverse economic and market conditions  fluctuating costs of raw materials  including steel and aluminum  and delays in the delivery of raw materials  our ability to maintain relationships with our suppliers of railcar components  our reliance upon a small number of customers that represent a large percentage of our sales  the variable purchase patterns of our customers and the timing of completion  delivery and acceptance of customer orders  the highly competitive nature of our industry  risks relating to our relationship with our unionized employees and their unions  our ability to manage our health care and pension costs  our reliance on the sales of our aluminum bodied coal carrying railcars  shortages of skilled labor  the risk of lack of acceptance of our new railcar offerings by our customers  the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations  the costs associated with being a public company  potential significant warranty claims  and various covenants in the agreement governing our indebtedness that limit our management s discretion in the operation of our businesses 
our actual results could be different from the results described in or anticipated by our forward looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates  forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated 
given these uncertainties  you should not rely on forward looking statements 
forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made 
we expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward looking statements  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws 
all of the forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have a million revolving credit facility which provides for financing of our working capital requirements and contains a million sub facility for letters of credit 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and we had issued approximately million in letters of credit under the sub facility for letters of credit 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on the borrowings under the revolving credit facility and do not plan to enter into swaps or other hedging arrangements to manage this risk  because we do not believe this interest rate risk to be significant 
on an annual basis  a change in the interest rate in our revolving credit facility will increase or decrease our interest expense by  for every million of outstanding borrowings 
we are exposed to price risks associated with the purchase of raw materials  especially aluminum and steel 
the cost of aluminum  steel and all other materials used in the production of our railcars represents a significant component of our direct manufacturing costs 
given the significant increases in the price of raw materials since november  this exposure can affect our costs of production 
we currently do not plan to enter into any hedging 
table of contents arrangements to manage the price risks associated with raw materials 
instead  we have either renegotiated existing contracts or entered into new contracts with substantially all of our customers that allow for variable pricing to protect us against future changes in the cost of raw materials 
as a result  substantially all of our contracts for railcars in our backlog at december  permit us to pass through charges related to increases in the cost of raw materials to our customers 
however  we may not always be able to pass on these increases in the future 
in particular  when raw material prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal  we may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers  which could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flows 
in the event that we are able to increase the prices of our railcars  any such price increases may reduce demand for our railcars 
the current high cost of the raw materials that we use to manufacture railcars  especially aluminum and steel  and delivery delays associated with these raw materials may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in passing on increases in the cost of aluminum and steel to our customers  a increase in the cost of aluminum and steel would increase our average cost of sales by approximately per railcar  which  for the year ended december   would have reduced income before income taxes by approximately million 
we are not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange risks as our general policy is to denominate foreign sales and purchases in us dollars
