item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations provides you with a narrative on our financial results 
it contains a discussion and analysis of the results of operations for each segment of our business  followed by a discussion and analysis of our financial condition 
the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report and were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
additional sections in this report which should be helpful to your reading of our discussion and analysis include the following o a description of our business strategy found in items and business and properties business strategy  o a description of developments during  found in items and business and properties recent developments  and o a description of risk factors affecting us and our business  found in item a risk factors 
we begin with a discussion of our critical accounting polices and estimates  those areas that are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates  and the application of generally accepted accounting principles involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities  our revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we routinely evaluate these estimates  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining o the economic useful lives of our assets  o the fair values used to allocate purchase price and to determine possible asset impairment charges  o reserves for environmental claims  legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities  o provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables  o exposures under contractual indemnifications  and o various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others  which policies are discussed following 
environmental matters with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  environmental expenditures that relate to current operations  and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs 
we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value  and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable 
the steps involved in the process of managing our environmental reporting include o identifying environmental regulatory issues that may affect us with respect to potential clean up liabilities  and the necessary level of investigation in order to determine the potential cost associated with environmental exposures  o completing a materiality analysis to determine the reporting necessary for each environmental issue  and o evaluating alternatives to properly manage our environmental liabilities going forward  including items such as environmental insurance to help limit estimated costs  thereby assuring our unitholders that the volatility often associated with environmental estimates will not impair the value of their holdings 
our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action  but generally  we recognize and or adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations 
in both december and december  after thorough reviews of any potential environmental issues and claims  we trued up adjusted our year end environmental liabilities to reflect revisions to previously estimated costs 
the adjustments  described more fully below  resulted in increases in environmental expenses 
in  we made quarterly adjustments to our environmental liabilities to reflect changes in previous estimates 
in addition to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability adjustments  we made supplemental liability adjustments in that were primarily related to newly identified and or recently incurred environmental issues and claims largely related to refined petroleum products pipeline releases of us and plantation pipe line company 
these supplemental environmental liability adjustments were recorded pursuant to our management s requirement to recognize contingent environmental liabilities whenever the associated environmental issue is likely to occur and the amount of our liability can be reasonably estimated 
in making these liability estimations  we considered the effect of environmental compliance  pending legal actions against us  and potential third party liability claims 
as a result  in  we recorded a combined million decrease in earnings associated with total environmental liability adjustments  including a million decrease in earnings associated with supplemental liability adjustments 
the total environmental expense adjustments including our share of environmental expense associated with liability adjustments recognized by plantation pipe line company included a million increase in our estimated environmental receivables and reimbursables  a million decrease in our equity investments  a million increase in our overall accrued environmental and related claim liabilities  and a million increase in our accrued expense liabilities 
the million decrease in earnings related to supplemental environmental liability adjustments resulted in a million increase in expense to our products pipelines business segment and a million increase in expense to our natural gas pipelines business segment 
it consisted of a million expense recorded within operations and maintenance  a million expense recorded within earnings from equity investments  and a million reduction in expense recorded within income taxes in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for our environmental liability adjustments resulted from both revisions to previously estimated costs and from the necessity of properly adjusting our environmental expenses and accrued liabilities between our reportable business segments  and combined  the adjustments resulted in a million increase in environmental expense that primarily affected our products pipelines and terminals business segments 
the million increase in environmental expense resulted in a million increase in expense to our products pipelines business segment  a million increase in expense to our terminals business segment  a million increase in expense to our co business segment  and a million decrease in expense to our natural gas pipelines business segment 
the adjustment included an million increase in our estimated environmental receivables and reimbursables and a million increase in our overall accrued environmental and related claim liabilities 
we included the additional million expense within operations and maintenance in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for in  we recognized a million increase in environmental expenses and an associated million increase in deferred income tax expense resulting from changes to previous estimates 
the million expense item  including taxes  resulted from the necessity of properly adjusting our environmental expenses  liabilities and receivables between our four reportable business segments 
the net impact of the million expense item resulted in a million increase in expense to our products pipelines business segment  a million decrease in expense to our natural gas pipelines business segment  a million decrease in expense to our co business segment  and an million decrease in expense to our terminals business segment 
the adjustment included an million increase in our estimated environmental receivables and reimbursables and a million increase in our overall accrued environmental and related claim liabilities 
we included the additional million environmental expense within other  net in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for for more information on our environmental disclosures  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
legal matters we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders  judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
we expense legal costs as incurred  and all recorded legal liabilities are revised as better information becomes available 
sfpp  lp is the subsidiary limited partnership that owns our pacific operations pipelines  excluding calnev pipe line llc 
tariffs charged by our pacific operations pipeline systems are subject to certain proceedings at the ferc involving shippers complaints regarding the interstate rates  as well as practices and the jurisdictional nature of certain facilities and services 
generally  the interstate rates on our pacific operations pipeline systems are grandfathered under the energy policy act of unless substantially changed circumstances are found to exist 
to the extent substantially changed circumstances are found to exist  our pacific operations may be subject to substantial exposure under these ferc complaints and could  therefore  owe reparations and or refunds to complainants as mandated by ferc or the united states judicial system 
in december  we recorded an accrual of million for an expense attributable to an increase in our reserves related to our rate case liability  and we included this amount within operations and maintenance in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for the factors we considered when making this additional accrual included  among others i the opinions and views of our legal counsel  ii our experience with reparations and refunds previously paid to complainants and other shippers as required by ferc in  we paid transportation rate reparation and refund payments in the amount of million as mandated by the ferc  and iii the decision of our management as to how we intended to respond to the complaints  which included the compliance filing we submitted to the ferc on march  in accordance with the ferc s december order and february order on rehearing  rate reductions were implemented on may  we assume that reparations and accrued interest thereon will be paid no earlier than the second quarter of  however  the timing and nature of any rate reductions and reparations that may be ordered will likely be affected by the final disposition of the application of the ferc s new policy statement on income tax allowances to our pacific operations in the ferc docket nos 
or  or  and is proceedings 
we had previously estimated the combined annual impact of the rate reductions and the payment of reparations sought by shippers would be approximately cents of distributable cash flow per unit 
based on our review of the december and february ferc orders  and subject to the ultimate resolution of these issues in our compliance filings and subsequent judicial appeals  we now expect the total annual impact will be less than cents per unit 
we estimate that the actual  partial year impact on distributable cash flow was approximately million 
as of december   our total reserve related to various claims from lawsuits arising from our pacific operations pipeline transportation rates amounted to million 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we made refund payments of million to certain shippers on our pacific operations pipelines and we reduced our rate case liability 
the payment related to a settlement agreement reached in may that resolved certain challenges by complainants with regard to delivery tariffs and gathering enhancement fees at our pacific operations watson station  located in carson  california

intangible assets intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance 
we account for our intangible assets according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these accounting pronouncements introduced the concept of indefinite life intangible assets and provided that all identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives  including goodwill  will not be subject to regular periodic amortization 
such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite 
instead  the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
we have selected an impairment measurement test date of january of each year  and we have determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of january  as of january   our goodwill was million 
our remaining intangible assets  excluding goodwill  include lease value  contracts  customer relationships  technology based assets and agreements 
these intangible assets have definite lives  are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  and are reported separately as other intangibles  net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  these intangibles totaled million and million  respectively 
estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves  both developed and undeveloped 
the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect  among other things  whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed  the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities 
the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of proved reserves may change  either positively or negatively  as additional information becomes available and as contractual  economic and political conditions change 
hedging activities we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and floating interest rates  and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives 
however  the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are complex  and even when we engage in hedging transactions that are effective economically  these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes 
according to the provisions of current accounting standards  to be considered effective  changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged 
a perfectly effective hedge is one in which changes in the value of the derivative contract exactly offset changes in the value of the hedged item or expected cash flow of the future transactions in reporting periods covered by the derivative contract 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately  accordingly  our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges 
in addition  it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices 
for example  when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another  we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations 
even when we cannot enter into a completely effective hedge  we often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all  but due to the fact that the part of the hedging transaction that is not effective in offsetting undesired changes in commodity prices the ineffective portion is required to be recognized currently in earnings  our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge 
results of operations our business model is built to support two principal components o helping customers by providing energy  bulk commodity and liquids products transportation  storage and distribution  and o creating long term value for our unitholders 
to achieve these objectives  we focus on providing fee based services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energy related pipelines  bulk and liquids terminal facilities  and carbon dioxide and petroleum reserves 
our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise  and each of our four segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available

b includes unallocated interest income  interest and debt expense  general and administrative expenses including unallocated litigation and environmental expenses  minority interest expense and loss from early extinguishment of debt only 
driven by strong financial results from natural gas sales  storage and processing activities  and by incremental earnings from both dry bulk product and petroleum liquids terminal operations  we achieved a record level of net income in for the year  our net income was million per diluted unit on revenues of  million 
this compares with net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of  million in  and net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of  million in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses because our partnership agreement requires us to distribute of our available cash to our partners on a quarterly basis available cash consists primarily of all our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and changes in reserves  we consider each period s earnings before all non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  including amortization of excess cost of equity investments  to be an important measure of our success in maximizing returns to our partners 
we also use segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses defined in the table above internally as a measure of profit and loss used for evaluating segment performance and for deciding how to allocate resources to our four reportable business segments 
combined  our four business segments reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of  million in   million in and  million in both the million increase in total segment earnings before depreciation  depletion  and amortization in compared to  and the million increase in compared to were attributable to internal growth and expansion and to incremental contributions from assets and operations acquired since the end of combined  the net effect of the certain other items described in footnote a in the table above resulted in a million increase in total segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in relative to  and a million decrease in segment earnings in relative to the remaining increases of million and million  respectively  in total segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in and  relative to prior years  consisted of the following o increases of million and million  respectively  from our terminals segment primarily driven by both higher revenues earned from transporting and storing higher volumes of petroleum and petrochemical related liquids and dry bulk material products  and incremental earnings from the impact of completed internal expansion projects and acquired terminal operations since the end of o increases of million and million  respectively  from our natural gas pipelines segment largely due to improved sales margins on renewal and incremental natural gas sales contracts  higher earnings from natural gas storage  gathering and treating operations  and in  to higher earnings from natural gas processing activities  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our co segment primarily due to higher sales of carbon dioxide  crude oil  and natural gas processing plant liquids products at higher average prices  and to higher revenues from carbon dioxide transportation and related services associated with enhanced crude oil recovery operations  and o a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively  from our products pipelines segment 
as described more fully below in products pipelines  the decrease in compared to was largely related to incremental pipeline maintenance expenses related to a change beginning in the third quarter of that transferred certain pipeline integrity management costs from sustaining capital expenditures to expense 
the increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to was mainly due to higher revenues from deliveries of refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids  higher revenues from refined products terminal operations  and to incremental earnings from the acquisition of southeast terminal operations acquired in while it is difficult to predict change in demand for energy transportation  as well as future prices for energy commodity products and overall economic trends  going forward  we anticipate a increase in our total segment earnings before depreciation  depletion  and amortization expenses in compared to the key to our anticipated growth in will be the continued expansion of our businesses  principally through capital investments that will add throughput capacity to our refined products and natural gas pipeline systems  increase our natural gas storage capacity  expand and enhance our terminal services  and add infrastructure to our crude oil development and carbon dioxide flooding operations 
additionally  we declared a cash distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of an annualized rate of per unit 
this distribution was higher than the per unit distribution we made for the fourth quarter of  and higher than the per unit distribution we made for the fourth quarter of we expect to declare cash distributions of at least per unit for  however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve this level of distribution  and our expectation does not take into account any capital costs associated with financing the payment of reparations sought by shippers on our pacific operations interstate pipelines 
our general partner and our common and class b unitholders receive quarterly distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives quarterly distributions in additional i units 
the value of the quarterly per share distribution of i units is based on the value of the quarterly per share cash distribution made to our common and class b unitholders

our products pipelines segment s primary businesses include transporting refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids through pipelines and operating liquid petroleum products terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix processing facilities 
the segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in this compares with earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in  and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization the segment s overall million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with and its million decrease in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with included an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from the combined net effect of the certain other items described in the footnotes to the table above 
these items consisted of the following o an increase in earnings of million in related to two separate contract settlements from our petroleum transmix processing operations 
first  we recorded income of million from fees received for the early termination of a long term transmix processing agreement at our colton  california processing facility 
secondly  we recorded an expense of million related to payments we made to motiva enterprises llc in june to settle claims for prior period transmix purchase costs at our richmond  virginia processing facility 
we included the net income of million from these two items within other  net in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   o a decrease in earnings of million in due to an increase in operating expenses related to an adjustment to our products pipelines rate case liability in december this adjustment is more fully described above in critical accounting policies and estimates legal matters  o a decrease in earnings of million  million and million  respectively in  and due to the increases in expenses associated with the adjustments of our environmental liabilities as more fully described above in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters  and o a decrease in earnings of million in due to an increase in operating expenses related to adjustments made to account for differences between physical and book natural gas liquids inventory on our north system natural gas liquids pipeline 
this inventory expense was based on a reconciliation of our north system s natural gas liquids inventory that was completed in the fourth quarter of the remaining million decrease in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with  and the remaining million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with consisted of the following items o a decrease in earnings of million in due to incremental pipeline maintenance expenses recognized in the last half of beginning in the third quarter of  the refined petroleum products pipelines and associated terminal operations included within our products pipelines segment including plantation pipe line company  our owned equity investee began recognizing certain costs incurred as part of its pipeline integrity management program as maintenance expense in the period incurred  and in addition  recorded an expense for costs previously capitalized during the first six months of the overall decrease in earnings consisted of an million decrease related to a change that transferred certain pipeline integrity management costs from sustaining capital expenditures within property  plant and equipment  net on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets to maintenance expense within operations and maintenance in our accompanying consolidated statements of income and a million decrease related to the expensing of pipeline integrity costs in the second half of pipeline integrity costs encompass those costs incurred as part of an overall pipeline integrity management program  which is a process for assessing and mitigating pipeline risks in order to reduce both the likelihood and consequences of incidents 
an effective pipeline integrity program is a systematic  comprehensive process that entails pipeline assessment services  maintenance and repair services  and regulatory compliance 
our pipeline integrity program is designed to provide our management the information needed to effectively allocate resources for appropriate prevention  detection and mitigation activities 
combined  this change reduced the segment s earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses by million in increasing maintenance expenses by million  decreasing earnings from equity investments by million  and decreasing income tax expenses by million  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our southeast refined products terminal operations 
our southeast terminal operations consist of refined products terminals located in the southeastern united states that we acquired since december the increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to was driven by higher liquids throughput volumes at higher rates  relative to  and higher margins from ethanol blending and sales activities 
the increase included incremental earnings of million from both the seven refined products terminal operations we acquired in march from exxonmobil corporation and the nine refined products terminal operations we acquired in november from charter terminal company and charter triad terminals  llc 
this incremental amount represents the acquired terminals earnings during the additional months of ownership in  as compared to  and does not include increases or decreases during the same months we owned the assets in both years 
the remaining million increase in earnings in versus representing the increase from the same months we owned all assets in both years was primarily due to higher product throughput revenues  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our combined pacific and calnev pipeline operations 
the increase in earnings in compared to was primarily due to a million increase in operating revenues  which more than offset an million increase in combined operating expenses 
the increase in operating revenues consisted of a million increase from refined products deliveries and a million increase from terminal and other fee revenue 
the increase in operating expenses included incremental environmental expenses of million and incremental fuel and power expenses of million 
these incremental environmental expenses were associated with our quarterly true ups of estimated environmental liability adjustments and were not included with the expenses associated with the supplemental environmental liability adjustments discussed above in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters 
the increase in fuel and power expenses in compared to was largely the result of higher electricity usage and higher utility rates in the increase in earnings in compared to was primarily revenue driven revenues from refined petroleum products deliveries increased million and terminal service revenues increased million 
the increase reflects higher pipeline delivery revenues from our pacific operations north line pipeline  largely due to our completion of a million capital expansion project in december the expansion project increased the capacity of the north line by approximately  and involved the replacement of an existing mile  inch diameter pipeline segment with a new inch diameter line and the rerouting of certain pipeline segments away from environmentally sensitive areas and residential neighborhoods  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our central florida pipeline 
both increases were mainly due to higher year over year product delivery revenues the revenue increase was driven by higher average tariff and terminal rates  and the revenue increase resulted from an increase in throughput delivery volumes  o an increase of million and a decrease of million respectively  from the combined operations of our north system and cypress natural gas liquids pipelines 
the increase in earnings in compared to consisted of a million increase from our north system and a million decrease from our cypress pipeline 
the increase from our north system was primarily due to a million increase in system throughput revenues  and the decrease from cypress was mainly due to higher fuel and power costs  related to an over increase in natural gas liquids delivery volumes in versus the decrease in earnings in compared to consisted of a million decrease from our north system and a million decrease from our cypress pipeline 
the north system decrease was mainly due to higher product storage expenses  related to both a new storage contract agreement entered into in april and higher levels of year end inventory in the cypress pipeline decrease was driven by lower revenues  the result of a decrease in throughput volumes that was largely due to the third quarter hurricane related closure of a petrochemical plant in lake charles  louisiana that is served by the pipeline 
o an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from our petroleum pipeline transmix processing operations 
the increase consisted of incremental earnings of million from the inclusion of our greensboro  north carolina transmix facility in  and a decrease in earnings of million from the combined operations of our remaining transmix facilities  largely due to higher operating  fuel and power costs which offset increases in processing revenues 
in the second quarter of  we completed construction and placed into service the approximate million greensboro facility  which is capable of processing barrels of transmix per day for plantation and other interested parties 
in  the facility earned revenues of million and incurred operating expenses of million 
the million decrease in earnings in relative to was due to both lower revenues and lower other income 
the decrease in revenues was due to a nearly decrease in processing volumes  largely resulting from the disallowance  beginning in july  of methyl tertiary butyl ether blended transmix in the state of illinois 
the decrease in other income was due to a million benefit taken from the reversal of certain short term liabilities in the second quarter of  o an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from our ownership interest in the cochin pipeline system 
the increase was largely related to lower pipeline operating expenses in compared to the decrease in expenses  including labor and power costs  resulted from year to year decreases in both pipeline delivery volumes and pipeline repair costs 
the decrease in expenses more than offset a drop in operating revenues in versus  due mainly to a decrease in transportation volumes resulting from pipeline operating pressure restrictions 
the decrease in earnings in resulted from both lower transportation revenues and higher operating expenses  when compared to the decrease in revenues was due to a drop in delivery volumes caused by extended pipeline testing and repair activities and by warmer winter weather  and the increase in operating expenses was due principally to higher pipeline repair  maintenance and testing costs  o decreases of million and million  respectively  from our west coast terminal operations 
the decrease reflects incremental environmental expenses of million recognized in and not included with the expenses associated with the supplemental environmental liability adjustments discussed above 
these environmental expenses followed quarterly reviews of any potential environmental issues that could impact our west coast terminal operations and  when aggregated with all remaining expenses  resulted in a combined million increase in operating expenses in versus the higher expenses more than offset a million increase in operating revenues  largely attributable to higher fees from ethanol blending services and from revenue increases across all service activities performed at our carson  california and our connected los angeles harbor products terminal 
the decrease in earnings in compared to was largely due to higher property tax expenses in  due to expense reversals taken in the second quarter of pursuant to favorable property reassessments  and to lower product revenues resulting from the fourth quarter closure of our gaffey street products terminal located in san pedro  california  and o a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively  from our approximate ownership interest in plantation pipe line company 
earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from our investment in plantation were essentially flat in versus  as lower equity earnings were mostly offset by lower operatorship expenses 
the decrease in both lower net income and pipeline operating expenses were associated with lower year to year transportation revenues  due primarily to an almost drop in overall refined products delivery volumes in the decline in volumes was primarily due to alternative pipeline service into southeast markets and to changes in supply from louisiana and mississippi refineries related to new ultra low sulfur diesel and ethanol blended gasoline requirements 
the drop in revenues was largely offset by lower operating and power expenses  due to the lower transportation volumes 
the increase in earnings in relative to was mainly due to the recognition  in  of incremental interest income of million on our long term note receivable from plantation 
in july  we loaned million to plantation to allow it to pay all of its outstanding credit facility and commercial paper borrowings and in exchange for this funding  we received a seven year note receivable bearing interest at the rate of per annum 
segment details revenues for the segment increased million in compared to  and increased million in compared to the respective year to year increases in segment revenues were principally due to the following o increases of million and million  respectively  from our southeast terminals 
the increase was largely attributable to higher ethanol blending and sales revenues and higher liquids inventory sales offset by higher costs of sales  as described below 
the increase was primarily due to terminal acquisitions including incremental revenues of million attributable to the charter terminals we acquired in november and million attributable to the exxonmobil terminals we acquired in march  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our pacific operations 
the increase in revenues in compared to consisted of a million increase in refined products delivery revenues and a million increase in refined products terminal revenues in  compared to the increase from product deliveries reflect a increase in mainline delivery volumes in  and includes the impact of both rate reductions that went into effect on may   based on ferc filings associated with our pacific operations rate litigation  and rate increases that went into effect july  and july   according to the ferc annual index rate increase a producer price index finished goods adjustment 
the increase from terminal revenues was due to the higher transportation barrels and to incremental service revenues  including diesel lubricity improving injection services that we began offering in may our pacific operations million increase in revenues in relative to included increases of million from mainline refined products delivery revenues and million from incremental terminal revenues 
the increase from products delivery revenues was driven by a increase in mainline delivery volumes and by increases in average mainline tariff rates  the increase from terminal operations was primarily due to increased terminal and ethanol blending services  largely as a result of the increase in pipeline throughput  and to incremental revenues from diesel lubricity improving injection services 
the increase in mainline tariff rates included both ferc approved annual indexed interstate tariff increases in july and  and a filed rate increase on our completed north line expansion with the california public utility commission 
in november  we filed an application with the cpuc requesting a million increase in existing california intrastate transportation rates to reflect the in service date of our million north line expansion project 
pursuant to cpuc regulations  this increase automatically became effective december   but is being collected subject to refund  pending resolution of protests to the application by certain shippers  o an increase of million in versus from our west coast terminals 
terminal revenues were flat across both and  but increased in compared to due to storage rent escalations  higher throughput barrels and rates at various locations  and additional tank capacity at our carson los angeles harbor system terminals  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our calnev pipeline 
the increase in compared to consisted of a million increase from higher refined products deliveries and a million increase from overall terminal revenues 
the increase from products deliveries was due to a increase in delivery volumes and a increase in average tariff rates including ferc annual index rate increases in july and 
the higher terminal revenues resulted primarily from additional transportation barrel deliveries at our barstow  california and las vegas  nevada terminals  and from higher diesel lubricity additive injection service revenues 
the million increase in revenues in versus consisted of a million increase from refined products delivery revenues  primarily due to volume growth  and a million increase from terminal operations  due to higher product storage  injection and ethanol blending services  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our central florida pipeline 
the increase was due to a increase in average tariff rates compared to the increased rates reflect reductions in zone based credits in versus the year to year increase in revenues in compared to was due to an increase in transport volumes  partly due to hurricane related pipeline delivery disruptions in the state of florida during the third quarter of  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our north system 
the increase was due to higher natural gas liquids delivery revenues in versus  driven by a increase in system throughput volumes 
the volume increase was primarily related to additional refinery demand in versus the increase was due to higher average tariff rates  which more than offset a drop in revenues caused by a decline in delivery volumes 
the increase in tariff rates in over resulted from both a higher ratio of long haul shipments to shorter haul shipments and  to a lesser extent  higher published tariff rates that were approved by the ferc and became effective april  the new rates were associated with a cost of service filing that was approved by the ferc 
the decline in volumes was mainly related to lower propane demand due to warmer winter weather in the midwest during relative to  and o decreases of million and million  respectively  from our ownership interest in the cochin pipeline system  as described above 
combining all of the segment s operations  total delivery volumes of refined petroleum products decreased in compared to  but increased in compared to compared to last year  our pacific operations total delivery volumes were up  due in part to the east line expansion which was in service for the last seven months of the expansion project substantially increased pipeline capacity from el paso  texas to tucson and phoenix  arizona 
in addition  our calnev pipeline delivery volumes were up in versus  due primarily to strong demand from the southern california and las vegas  nevada markets 
the overall decrease in year to year segment deliveries of refined products was largely related to a drop in volumes from the plantation pipeline in  as described above 
compared to  total deliveries of natural gas liquids increased in  driven by the higher volumes on our north system 
for  the overall increase in delivery volumes compared with included increases on pacific  central florida and calnev  offset by a decrease on plantation 
excluding plantation  which was impacted by gulf coast hurricanes and post hurricane refinery disruptions in  refined products delivery volumes increased in compared to by product  deliveries of gasoline  diesel fuel and jet fuel increased  and  respectively  in compared to year to year deliveries of natural gas liquids were down in versus the decrease was due to low demand for propane on both the north system and the cypress pipeline 
the drop in demand on the north system was primarily due to a minimal grain drying season and to warmer weather in  the drop on cypress was chiefly due to reduced demand from a petrochemical plant located in lake charles  louisiana  resulting from hurricane related closures in the segment s operating expenses  which consist of all cost of sales expenses  operating and maintenance expenses  fuel and power expenses  and all tax expenses  excluding income taxes  decreased million in versus and increased million in versus combined  the net effect attributable to four items previously discussed i the expensing of pipeline integrity costs in  ii the adjusting of segment environmental liability balances in  and  iii the adjusting of our pacific operations pipeline rate case liability in  and iv the expensing of inventory costs associated with the reconciliation of our north system s inventory balances in  resulted in a million decrease in operating expenses in relative to  and a million increase in operating expenses in relative to the remaining year over year increases of million in compared to and million in compared to  primarily consisted of the following o increases of million and million  respectively  from our southeast terminals 
the increase was largely attributable to higher costs of sales related to higher ethanol blending and higher ethanol and liquids purchases offset by higher ethanol revenues 
the increase was primarily due to incremental expenses related to the terminal operations we acquired in including expenses of million attributable to the charter terminals we acquired in november  and million attributable to the exxonmobil terminals we acquired in march  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our combined pacific and calnev pipeline operations 
the increase was due to a lower capitalization of expenses  relative to  higher fuel and power  and higher remedial and repair expenses 
the decrease in capitalized costs was primarily due to the expensing of pipeline integrity management costs in  versus capitalizing such costs in the prior year 
the increase in fuel and power expenses was due to higher refined products delivery volumes and higher average utility rates in  and to a utility rebate credit received in the first quarter of the increase in pipeline repair expenses was largely related to pipeline failures and releases that have occurred since the end of the million increase in expenses in compared to was mainly due to higher labor and operating expenses  including incremental power expenses  associated with increased transportation volumes and terminal operations 
the segment also incurred higher maintenance and inspection expenses during as a result of environmental issues  clean up  and pipeline repairs associated with wash outs that were caused by flooding in the state of california in the first quarter of  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our west coast terminals 
the increase in expenses in relative to was primarily related to incremental environmental expenses of million not related to the segment s supplemental environmental liability adjustments in and to higher materials and supplies expense as a result of lower capitalized overhead 
the increase in operating expenses in compared to was chiefly due to higher property tax expenses  described above  and higher cost of sales related to incremental terminal services  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our central florida pipeline operations 
the increase in compared to was due to incremental environmental expenses not related to the segment s supplemental environmental liability adjustments in 
the increase in operating expenses in compared to was primarily due to higher maintenance expenses  due to additional expense accruals related to a pipeline release occurring in september  o a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively  from our proportionate interest in the cochin pipeline 
the decrease in expenses in was mainly due to the drop in throughput volumes in compared to the increase in expenses in versus was primarily due to higher labor and outside services associated with pipeline maintenance and testing costs  and partly due to a full year s inclusion of an additional ownership interest in cochin 
effective october   we acquired an additional undivided interest in the cochin pipeline system for approximately million  bringing our total interest to  and o a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively  from our north system 
the decrease was due to both higher product gains and lower fuel and power expenses relative to  partly offset by higher property tax expenses related to an expense true up recognized in the third quarter of the increase was primarily due to higher liquids storage expenses in  as discussed above 
earnings from our products pipelines equity investments were million in  million in and million in earnings from equity investments consist primarily of our approximate interest in the pre tax income of plantation pipe line company and our interest in the net income of heartland pipeline company and johnston county terminal  llc 
we include our proportionate share of plantation s income tax expenses within income taxes in our accompanying statements of income  and the interest income we earn on loans to plantation are reported within interest  net in our accompanying statements of income 
the million decrease in equity earnings in compared to was mainly due to lower equity earnings from plantation  due to both a million decrease for our proportionate share of plantation s pre tax pipeline integrity expenses that were recognized in the second half of  and a million decrease for our proportionate share of pre tax environmental expenses recognized by plantation in the second quarter of this environmental expense was related to supplemental environmental and clean up liability adjustments associated with an april  pipeline release of turbine fuel from plantation s inch petroleum products pipeline located in henrico county  virginia 
the million decrease in equity earnings in compared to primarily consisted of a million decrease related to our investment in plantation and a million increase related to our investment in heartland 
for our investment in plantation  the decrease was due to lower overall pre tax income earned by plantation  due to  among other things  higher operating expenses and higher interest expenses 
for our investment in heartland  the increase was due to heartland s higher net income  primarily due to higher pipeline delivery volumes in versus the segment s income from allocable interest income and other income and expense items increased million in compared to  and increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to the million other income item from the favorable settlement of transmix processing contracts in the second quarter of  and partly due to higher administrative overhead collected by our west coast terminals from reimbursable projects 
for  the increase primarily related to incremental interest income of million on our long term note receivable from plantation  as discussed above 
income tax expenses decreased million in compared to  and decreased million in compared to the decrease in versus was related to the lower pre tax earnings from cochin and plantation  and the decrease in versus was mainly due to lower income tax on cochin due to the decrease in canadian operating results in non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  including amortization of excess cost of investments  were million  million and million in each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in compared to was primarily due to higher depreciation expenses from our pacific and southeast terminal operations 
the increase from our pacific operations related to higher depreciable costs as a result of capital spending for both pipeline and storage expansion since the end of in order to strengthen and enhance our business operations on the west coast 
the increase from our southeast terminal operations related to incremental depreciation charges resulting from final purchase price allocations  made in the fourth quarter of  for depreciable terminal assets we acquired in november from charter terminal company and charter triad terminals  llc 
the overall million increase in depreciation expenses in compared to was primarily due to higher depreciation expenses from our pacific operations  related to the capital investments made since the end of  as well as to incremental depreciation expenses of million related to the southeast terminal assets we acquired in march and november natural gas pipelines year ended december  in thousands  except operating statistics revenues operating expenses including environmental adjustments a earnings from equity investments interest income and other  net income expense income taxes earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and amortization of excess cost of equity investments depreciation  depletion and amortization expense amortization of excess cost of equity investments segment earnings natural gas transport volumes trillion btus b natural gas sales volumes trillion btus c a amount includes expense of  associated with supplemental environmental liability adjustments  a  reduction in expense due to the release of a reserve related to a natural gas pipeline contract obligation  and a  gain from the combined sale of our douglas natural gas gathering system and painter unit fractionation facility

b includes kinder morgan interstate gas transmission  texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  trailblazer and transcolorado pipeline volumes 
transcolorado annual volumes are included for all three years acquisition date november  
c represents texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group 
our natural gas pipelines segment s primary businesses involve marketing  transporting  storing  gathering and processing natural gas through both intrastate and interstate pipeline systems and related facilities 
in  the segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of  million 
this compares with earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of  million in and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of  million in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization the segment s overall million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with and its million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with included an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from the combined net effect of the certain other items described in footnote a to the table above 
these items consisted of the following o an increase in earnings of million in due to the sale of our douglas natural gas gathering system and painter unit fractionation facility in april effective april   we sold these two assets to a third party for approximately million in cash  and we included a net gain of million within other expense income in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for for more information on this gain  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  o an increase in earnings of million in due to release of a reserve related to a natural gas purchase sales contract associated with the operations of our west clear lake natural gas storage facility located in harris county  texas 
we acquired this storage facility as part of our acquisition of kinder morgan tejas on january   and upon acquisition  we established a reserve for a contract liability  and o a decrease in earnings of million in and an increase in earnings of million in due to changes in environmental operating expenses associated with the adjustments of our environmental liabilities as more fully described above in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters 
the segment s remaining million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with was driven by higher earnings from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  primarily from improved margins resulting from the negotiation of renewal and incremental gas purchase and sales contracts  and by higher earnings from natural gas storage and processing activities 
our texas intrastate group includes the operations of the following four natural gas pipeline systems kinder morgan tejas including kinder morgan border pipeline  kinder morgan texas pipeline  kinder morgan north texas pipeline and our mier monterrey mexico pipeline 
combined  the group accounted for of the total increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in versus the segment s remaining million increase in earnings in compared with was mainly due to higher margins on recurring natural gas sales business and higher storage and service revenues from our texas intrastate group  and to incremental contributions from the inclusion of our transcolorado pipeline  a mile interstate natural gas pipeline system that extends from the western slope of colorado to the blanco natural gas hub in northwestern new mexico 
we acquired the transcolorado pipeline from kmi on november   and the incremental amounts above relate to transcolorado s operations during the first ten months of and do not include increases or decreases during the same two months we owned the asset in both and specifically  the respective remaining changes in year to year segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in versus  and versus  consisted of the following o increases of million and million  respectively  from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group due primarily to improved margins on the group s natural gas purchase and sales activities  described above 
with regard to our natural gas sales activities  margin is defined as the difference between the prices at which we buy gas in our supply areas and the prices at which we sell gas in our market areas  less the cost of fuel to transport 
in  our texas intrastate group s natural gas sales margin increased million over  and in  the group s margin increased million over the group s margin can vary depending upon  among other things  the price volatility of natural gas produced and delivered in texas and in the surrounding gulf coast region  the changes in availability and demand for transportation and storage capacities  and any changes in the terms or conditions in which natural gas is purchased and sold 
additionally  we manage price risk associated with unfavorable changes in natural gas prices by using energy derivative contracts  such as over the counter forward contracts and both fixed price and basis swaps  to help lock in favorable margins from our natural gas purchase and sales activities  thereby generating more stable earnings during periods of fluctuating natural gas prices  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our kinder morgan interstate gas transmission system 
the increase in  relative to  was due largely to higher revenues earned in from both operational sales of natural gas and natural gas park and loan services 
the increase in earnings from these incremental revenues more than offset a relative decrease in earnings resulting from favorable natural gas imbalance valuation adjustments recognized in the increase in earnings in compared to was due mainly to higher revenues from both favorable fuel recovery volumes and prices and favorable imbalance valuation adjustments 
in addition  kmigt realized lower operating expenses in compared to  primarily due to the expensing  in the fourth quarter of  of certain capitalized project costs that no longer held realizable economic benefits 
the increase in revenues in versus was partially offset by lower margins on operational gas sales and reduced cushion gas volumes sold  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our equity investment in red cedar gathering company due largely to higher natural gas gathering revenues and to higher prices on incremental sales of excess fuel gas 
additionally  since the end of  we reduced the amount of natural gas lost and used within the system during gathering operations  which in turn has increased natural gas volumes available for sale  o increases of million and million respectively  from our transcolorado pipeline the increase was largely due to higher natural gas transmission revenues earned in compared to the revenue increase related to higher natural gas delivery volumes resulting from both system improvements and the successful negotiation of incremental firm transportation contracts 
the pipeline system improvements were associated with an expansion  completed since the end of the first quarter of  on the northern portion of the pipeline 
transcolorado s north system expansion project was in service on january   and provides for up to million cubic feet per day of additional northbound transportation capacity 
the overall increase in earnings in compared to was primarily due to incremental earnings of million  representing transcolorado s earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in the first ten months of after acquiring the pipeline on november   o an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from the combined operations of our casper douglas and painter natural gas gathering and processing operations 
the increase in earnings was primarily related to incremental earnings associated with favorable hedge settlements from our casper douglas natural gas gathering and processing operations 
we benefited from comparative differences in hedge settlements associated with the rolling off of older low price crude oil and propane positions at december  the decrease in earnings in versus was mainly due to higher cost of sales expense and higher commodity hedging costs in the higher cost of sales expense reflected higher natural gas purchase costs  due to higher average gas prices in the higher commodity hedging costs was chiefly due to unfavorable changes in settlement prices  o increases of million and million  respectively  from our trailblazer pipeline due primarily to timing differences on the settlements of pipeline transportation imbalances in and  compared to the respective year earlier periods 
these pipeline imbalances are due to differences between the volumes received and the volumes delivered at inter connecting points on the pipeline  and generally  our imbalances are either settled in cash or made up in kind subject to both the pipelines various tariff provisions and operational balancing agreements with shippers 
the increase in earnings in compared to was also due to incremental sales of operational natural gas in the fourth quarter of  largely related to timing differences  and o a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively  from the combined earnings of our remaining natural gas operations  including our previous investment in coyote gas treating  llc and our investment in thunder creek gas services  llc the decrease in was due to both the absence of equity earnings from our investment in coyote and to lower natural gas gathering income from thunder creek 
effective september   we and the southern ute indian tribe contributed the value of our respective ownership interests in coyote gas treating  llc to red cedar  and as a result  coyote gas treating  llc became a wholly owned subsidiary of red cedar 
the increase in earnings in compared to was largely due to incremental interest income from our long term note receivable from coyote 
in  we allocated this interest income to our natural gas pipelines business segment  versus treating it as unallocated interest income in in march  we contributed the principal amount of million related to this note to our equity investment in coyote 
for more information on this note and on our equity contribution to red cedar  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
segment details in  total segment operating revenues  including revenues from natural gas sales  decreased  million compared to  and combined operating expenses  including natural gas purchase costs  decreased million 
in  the segment reported significant increases in both revenues and operating expenses when compared to the year earlier period revenues increased  million and operating expenses increased  million 
the year to year changes in total segment revenues and total segment operating expenses largely represented the respective changes in our texas intrastate group s natural gas sales revenues and natural gas purchase expenses  due primarily to year over year changes in natural gas prices 
our intrastate group s purchase and sale activities result in considerably higher revenues and operating expenses compared to the interstate operations of our rocky mountain pipelines  which include our kmigt  trailblazer and transcolorado pipelines 
all three pipelines charge a transportation fee for gas transmission service and have the authority to initiate natural gas sales primarily for operational purposes  but none engage in significant gas purchases for resale 
we did  however  realize incremental revenues of million and incremental operating expenses of million from the ownership of our transcolorado pipeline in the first ten months of as discussed above  our texas intrastate group both purchases and sells significant volumes of natural gas 
compared to the respective prior year  revenues from the sales of natural gas from our intrastate group decreased  million in  and increased  million in similarly  the group s costs of sales expense  including natural gas purchase costs  decreased  million in  and increased  million in since our texas intrastate group sells natural gas in the same price environment in which it is purchased  any increases in its gas purchase costs are largely offset by corresponding increases in its sales revenues 
due to this offsetting of revenues and expenses  we believe that margin is a better comparative performance indicator than either revenues or cost of sales  and our objective is to match purchases and sales in the aggregate  and to lock in an acceptable margin by capturing the difference between our average gas sales prices and our average gas purchase and cost of fuel prices 
our strategy involves relying mainly on long term natural gas sales and purchase agreements  with some purchases and sales being made in the spot market in order to provide some flexibility to balance supply and demand in reaction to changing market conditions 
our texas intrastate groups natural gas sales margin increased million and million  respectively  in and  when compared to the year earlier period 
the variations in natural gas sales margin were driven by changes in natural gas prices and sales volumes the million margin increase in consisted of a million increase from favorable changes in average sales versus average purchase prices favorable price variance  and a million decrease from lower volumes unfavorable volume variance the million margin increase in consisted of a million increase from favorable changes in average sales prices versus average purchase prices  and a million decrease from lower volumes 
also  the intrastate groups margins from natural gas processing activities increased million in compared to  and decreased million in compared to we account for the segment s investments in red cedar gathering company  thunder creek gas services  llc  and prior to september   coyote gas treating  llc under the equity method of accounting 
combined earnings from these three investees increased million and million respectively  in and  when compared to year earlier periods 
the increases were chiefly due to higher net income earned by red cedar during and  partially offset by lower net income from our combined investments in coyote gas treating llc and thunder creek gas services  llc  all discussed above 
the segment s combined interest income and earnings from other income items other  net decreased million in compared to  and increased million in compared to the decrease was chiefly due to a gain from a property disposal by our kinder morgan tejas pipeline in the third quarter of the increase was mainly due to the allocation of interest income earned  in  on our note receivable from coyote gas treating  llc 
income tax expenses changed slightly over both and decreasing million in  and increasing million in  when compared to prior years 
the changes primarily related to tax accrual adjustments related to the operations of our mier monterrey mexico pipeline 
the segment s non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  including amortization of excess cost of investments increased million in compared to  and increased million in compared to the increase was largely attributable to higher year to year depreciation expenses from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  due both to incremental capital spending during  and to additional depreciation charges related to the group s acquisition of our north dayton  texas natural gas storage facility in august the increase was due to incremental depreciation expenses of million from the inclusion of the acquired transcolorado pipeline  and higher depreciation expenses on the assets of our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  due to additional capital investments made since the end of co year ended december  in thousands  except operating statistics revenues a operating expenses including environmental adjustments b earnings from equity investments other  net income expense income taxes earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and amortization of excess cost of equity investments depreciation  depletion and amortization expense c amortization of excess cost of equity investments segment earnings carbon dioxide delivery volumes bcf d sacroc oil production gross mbbl d e sacroc oil production net mbbl d f yates oil production gross mbbl d e yates oil production net mbbl d f natural gas liquids sales volumes net mbbl d f realized weighted average oil price per bbl g h realized weighted average natural gas liquids price per bbl h i a amount includes a  loss on derivative contracts used to hedge forecasted crude oil sales

our co segment consists of kinder morgan co company  lp and its consolidated affiliates 
the segment s primary businesses involve the production  marketing and transportation of both carbon dioxide commonly called co and crude oil  and the production and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
in  our co segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million 
this compares with earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in  and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in the segment s overall million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with and its million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with included decreases of million and million  respectively  from the combined net effect of the certain other items described in footnotes a and b to the table above 
these items consisted of the following o an decrease in earnings of million in due to a million loss on derivative contracts used to hedge forecasted crude oil sales  and o a decrease in earnings of million in and an increase in earnings of million in due to changes in environmental operating expenses associated with the adjustments of our environmental liabilities as more fully described above in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters 
the segment s remaining million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with was driven by higher earnings from the segment s carbon dioxide sales and transportation activities  the remaining million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with was primarily due to higher earnings from the segment s oil and gas producing activities 
segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization sales and transportation activities the segment s carbon dioxide sales and transportation activities reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million in  million in  and million in the increases in earnings were driven by higher revenues from both carbon dioxide sales and deliveries  and from crude oil pipeline transportation 
the overall increases were partly offset by lower equity earnings from the segment s ownership interest in cortez pipeline company 
the increases in carbon dioxide sales revenues were due to both higher average prices and higher sales volumes 
correlating closely with the increase in crude oil prices since the end of  average carbon dioxide sales prices increased and  respectively  in and  when compared to the prior year 
in addition  we did not use derivative contracts to hedge or help manage the financial impacts associated with the increases in carbon dioxide prices  and as always  we did not recognize profits on carbon dioxide sales to ourselves 
the increases in volumes were largely attributable to the continued strong demand for carbon dioxide from tertiary oil recovery projects in the permian basin area since the end of  and to increased carbon dioxide production from the mcelmo dome source field 
we operate and own a interest in mcelmo dome  which supplies carbon dioxide to oil recovery fields in the permian basin of southeastern new mexico and west texas 
combined deliveries of carbon dioxide on our central basin pipeline  our majority owned canyon reef carriers and pecos pipelines  our centerline pipeline  and our owned cortez pipeline  which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting  increased in and in  when compared to the respective prior years 
the increases in revenues from carbon dioxide and crude oil transportation were due to higher delivery volumes and higher rates 
the increase in volumes was largely related to infrastructure expansions at the sacroc and yates oil field units 
the sacroc and yates units are the two largest oil field units in which we hold ownership interests these interests include our approximate working interest in the sacroc unit  located in scurry county  texas  and our approximate working interest in the yates unit  located south of midland  texas 
in  we also benefited from the acquisition of the kinder morgan wink pipeline  a mile crude oil pipeline system originating in the permian basin of west texas and providing throughput to a crude oil refinery located in el paso  texas 
effective august   we acquired all of the partnership interests in kinder morgan wink pipeline  lp for million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities 
the acquisition of the pipeline and associated storage facilities allowed us to better manage crude oil deliveries from our oil field interests in west texas 
during the first eight months of  the kinder morgan wink pipeline accounted for incremental earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million and operating expenses of million 
oil and gas producing activities the remaining changes in year to year segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization a decrease of million in versus  and an increase of million in versus  were attributable to the segment s crude oil and natural gas producing activities  which also include its natural gas processing activities 
these operations include all construction  drilling and production activities necessary to produce oil and gas from its natural reservoirs  and all of the activities where natural gas is processed to extract liquid hydrocarbons  called natural gas liquids or commonly referred to as gas plant products 
combined  our co segment s oil and gas producing and gas processing activities reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million in  million in and million in in both and  we made significant capital investments to increase the capacity and deliverability of carbon dioxide and crude oil in and around the permian basin 
our investments were made in order to benefit from rising price trends for energy commodity products and from continued strong demand for carbon dioxide from tertiary oil recovery projects  which commonly inject carbon dioxide into reservoirs adjacent to producing crude oil wells 
once injected into the reservoir  the carbon dioxide gas often enhances crude oil recovery in two ways first  by expanding and pushing additional oil to the production wellbore  and secondly  by dissolving into the oil in order to lower its viscosity and improve its flow rate 
in  capital expenditures for our co business segment totaled million  this compares with capital expenditures of million in and million in the expenditures primarily represent incremental spending for new well and injection compression facilities at the sacroc and  to a lesser extent  yates oil field units 
the year over year million decrease in earnings in compared to was primarily due to higher combined operating expenses and to a previously disclosed drop in crude oil production at the sacroc oil field unit 
the higher operating expenses included higher field operating and maintenance expenses including well workover expenses  higher property and severance taxes  and higher fuel and power expenses 
the increases in expenses more than offset higher overall crude oil and natural gas plant product sales revenues  which increased primarily from higher realized sales prices and partly from higher crude oil production at the yates oil field unit 
the year over year increase in earnings of million in compared to was primarily driven by increased crude oil and natural gas processing plant liquids production volumes  and by higher realized weighted average sale prices for crude oil and gas plant products 
the year to year decline in crude oil production at the sacroc unit in was announced in the first quarter of at that time  we used information obtained from production performance to change our previous estimates of proved crude oil reserves at sacroc  however  due to the fact that the decrease in production is largely specific to one section of the field that is underperforming  we do not expect this reserve revision to have a material impact on our financial statements or capital spending in future periods 
for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and our measures of discounted future net cash flows from oil and gas reserves  please see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
as a result of our carbon dioxide and oil reserve ownership interests  we are exposed to commodity price risk associated with physical crude oil and natural gas liquids sales  however we mitigate this price risk through a long term hedging strategy that uses derivative contracts to reduce the impact of unpredictable changes in crude oil and natural gas liquids sales prices 
our goal is to use derivative contracts in order to prevent or reduce the possibility of future losses  and to generate more stable realized prices 
our hedging strategy involves the use of financial derivative contracts to manage this price risk on certain activities  including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the sale of crude oil and natural gas liquids 
our strategy  as it relates to our oil production business  primarily involves entering into a forward sale or  in some cases  buying a put option in order to establish a known price level 
in this way  we use derivative contracts to lock in an acceptable margin between our production costs and our selling price  in an attempt to protect ourselves against the risk of adverse price changes and to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream 
had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk  our crude oil sales prices would have averaged per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in in periods of rising prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids  we often surrender profits that would result from period to period price increases 
we believe  however  that our use of derivative contracts protects our unitholders from unpredictable adverse events 
all of our hedge gains and losses for crude oil and natural gas liquids are included in our realized average price for oil  none are allocated to natural gas liquids 
for more information on our hedging activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
segment details including the million hedge ineffectiveness loss in  our co segment s revenues increased million in compared to  and million in compared to the respective year over year increases were primarily due to the following o increases of million and million  respectively  from crude oil sales attributable to increases of and  respectively  in our realized weighted average price of crude oil and  in  to a increase in year over year sales volumes 
our overall crude oil sales volumes were flat across both and on a gross basis  meaning total quantity produced  combined daily oil production from the sacroc and yates units increased in compared to  and in compared to in  a drop in crude oil production at sacroc was offset by an increase in oil production at the yates oil field unit 
in  gross crude oil production increased at sacroc and at yates  when compared to o increases of million and million  respectively  from carbon dioxide sales due mainly to higher average sales prices  discussed above  and to year over year increases of in sales volumes in both and  o increases of million and million  respectively  from carbon dioxide and crude oil pipeline transportation revenues due largely to increases in system wide carbon dioxide delivery volumes and  in  to incremental crude oil transportation revenues from the kinder morgan wink pipeline  o increases of million and million  respectively  from natural gas liquids sales reflecting increases of and  respectively  in our realized weighted average natural gas liquids price per barrel 
in  we also benefited from a increase in liquids processing volumes  as compared to  primarily due to the capital expenditures and infrastructure improvements we made since the end of the increase in natural gas liquids sales was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes  primarily related to the lower crude oil production at sacroc  and o decreases of million and million  respectively  from natural gas sales due entirely to lower year over year sales volumes 
the decreases in volumes were mainly attributable to lower volumes of gas available for sale since the second quarter of due partly to the overall declining production at the sacroc field and partly to natural gas volumes used at the power plant we constructed at the sacroc oil field unit and placed in service in june construction of the plant began in mid  and the project was completed at a cost of approximately million 
we constructed the sacroc power plant in order to reduce our purchases of electricity from third parties  but it reduces our sales of natural gas because some natural gas volumes are consumed by the plant 
the power plant now provides approximately half of sacroc s current electricity needs 
kmi operates and maintains the power plant under a five year contract expiring in june  and we pay kmi an annual operating and maintenance fee 
compared to the respective prior years  the segment s operating expenses increased million in and million in the increases consisted of the following o increases of million and million  respectively  from combined cost of sales and field operating and maintenance expenses largely due to additional labor and field expenses  including well workover expenses  related to infrastructure expansions at the sacroc and yates oil field units since the end of workover expenses relate to incremental operating and maintenance charges incurred on producing wells in order to restore or increase production  and are often performed in order to stimulate production  add pumping equipment  remove fill from the wellbore  or mechanically repair the well 
our oil and gas operations  coupled with carbon dioxide flooding  often require a high level of investment  including ongoing expenses for facility upgrades  wellwork and drilling 
we continue to aggressively pursue opportunities to drill new wells and or expand existing wells for both carbon dioxide and crude oil in order to benefit from robust demand for energy commodities in and around the permian basin area 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  in some cases  the cost of carbon dioxide that is associated with enhanced oil recovery is capitalized as part of our development costs when it is injected 
the carbon dioxide costs incurred and capitalized as development costs for our co segment were million  million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  o increases of million and million  respectively  from fuel and power expenses due to increased carbon dioxide compression and equipment utilization  higher fuel costs  and higher electricity expenses due to higher rates as a result of higher fuel costs to electricity providers 
overall higher electricity costs were partly offset  however  by the benefits provided from the power plant we constructed at the sacroc oil field unit  o increases of million and million  respectively  from taxes  other than income taxes attributable mainly to higher property and production severance taxes 
the higher property taxes related to both increased asset infrastructure and higher assessed property values since the end of the higher severance taxes  which are primarily based on the gross wellhead production value of crude oil and natural gas  were driven by the higher period to period crude oil revenues  and o a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively  due to changes in environmental operating expenses associated with the adjustments of our environmental liabilities as more fully described above in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters 
earnings from equity investments  representing equity earnings from our ownership interest in the cortez pipeline company  decreased million in compared to  and million in compared to cortez owns and operates an approximate mile pipeline that carries carbon dioxide from the mcelmo dome source reservoir to the denver city  texas carbon dioxide hub 
the decreases in equity earnings were due to lower year over year net income earned by cortez since  mainly as a result of lower carbon dioxide transportation revenues 
the decreases in transportation revenues resulted from lower year to year average tariff rates  which more than offset incremental revenues realized as a result of higher carbon dioxide delivery volumes 
the decreases in tariff rates were expected because we benefited from higher tariffs in prior years  when tariffs were set higher in order to make up for under collected revenues 
non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  including amortization of excess cost of equity investments  increased million in compared to  and million in compared to the increases were due to both higher depreciable costs  as a result of incremental capital spending since the end of  and higher combined depreciation and depletion charges  related to year over year increases in crude oil production volumes 
in  we also realized incremental depreciation charges of million attributable to the various oil and gas properties we acquired in april from journey acquisition i  lp and journey  lp the increase in depreciation expenses in compared to was also due to a higher unit of production depletion rate used in  related to changes in estimated oil and gas reserves at the sacroc oil field unit 
our capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties must be amortized by the unit of production method so that each unit produced is assigned a pro rata portion of the unamortized costs 
these amortization rates must be revised at least annually  but are also adjusted if there is an indication that total estimated units are different than previously estimated

the segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in this compares with earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in the segment s overall million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with and its million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with  included an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from the combined net effect of the certain other items described in footnotes a and b to the table above 
these items consisted of the following o an increase in earnings of million in from the combined effect of a gain from the settlement of property casualty insurance claims and incremental repair and clean up expenses  both related to the hurricane season 
in the third quarter of  hurricane katrina struck the louisiana mississippi gulf coast  and hurricane rita struck the texas louisiana gulf coast  causing wide spread damage to both residential and commercial property 
the assets we operate that were impacted by the storm included several bulk and liquids terminal facilities located in the states of louisiana  mississippi and texas 
primarily affected was our international marine terminals facility  a louisiana partnership owned by us 
imt is a multi purpose bulk commodity transfer terminal facility located in port sulphur  louisiana 
the million increase in segment earnings consisted of i a million property casualty gain  ii a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses from hurricane repair and recovery activities  and iii a million increase in income tax expense associated with the segment s overall hurricane income and expense items 
including an additional million decrease in general and administrative expenses  and a million increase in minority interest expense  both related to hurricane activity and described below in other  total hurricane income and expense items increased our net income by million in for more information on our property casualty gain  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and o a decrease in earnings of million in and an increase in earnings of million in due to changes in environmental operating expenses associated with the adjustments of our environmental liabilities as more fully described above in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters 
the segment s remaining million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with and its remaining million increase in compared to were driven by a combination of internal expansions and strategic acquisitions 
we make and continue to seek key terminal acquisitions in order to gain access to new markets  to complement and or enlarge our existing terminal operations  and to benefit from the economies of scale resulting from increases in storage  handling and throughput capacity 
segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization terminal acquisitions our significant terminal acquisitions since the beginning of included the following o our texas petcoke terminals  located in and around the ports of houston and beaumont  texas  acquired effective april  o three terminals acquired separately in july our kinder morgan staten island terminal  a dry bulk terminal located in hawesville  kentucky and a liquids dry bulk facility located in blytheville  arkansas  o all of the ownership interests in general stevedores  lp  which operates a break bulk terminal facility located along the houston ship channel  acquired july   o our kinder morgan blackhawk terminal located in black hawk county  iowa  acquired in august  o a terminal related repair shop located in jefferson county  texas  acquired in september  o three terminal operations acquired separately in april terminal equipment and infrastructure located on the houston ship channel  a rail terminal located at the port of houston  and a rail ethanol terminal located in carson  california  and o all of the membership interests of transload services  llc  which provides material handling and steel processing services at steel related terminal facilities located in the chicago metropolitan area and various cities in the united states  acquired november  we have invested approximately million in cash and million in common units to acquire these terminal assets and combined  these operations accounted for incremental amounts of earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million and operating expenses of million  respectively  in a majority of these increases in earnings  revenues and expenses from terminal acquisitions were attributable to the inclusion of our texas petroleum coke terminals and repair shop assets  which we acquired from trans global solutions  inc on april  for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
the primary assets acquired included facilities and railway equipment located at the port of houston  the port of beaumont and the tgs deepwater terminal located on the houston ship channel 
combined  these operations accounted for incremental amounts of earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million and operating expenses of million  respectively  in for  we benefited significantly from the incremental contributions attributable to the bulk and liquids terminal businesses we acquired since the end of the third quarter of in addition to the acquisitions referred to above  these acquisitions included o the river terminals and rail transloading facilities owned and operated by kinder morgan river terminals llc and its consolidated subsidiaries  acquired effective october   and o our kinder morgan fairless hills terminal located along the delaware river in bucks county  pennsylvania  acquired effective december  combined  terminal operations acquired since the end of the third quarter of accounted for incremental amounts of earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million and operating expenses of million  respectively  in all of the incremental amounts listed above for both and  represent the earnings  revenues and expenses from the acquired terminals operations during the additional months of ownership in  and  respectively  and do not include increases or decreases during the same months we owned the assets in and  respectively 
for more information in regard to our terminal acquisitions  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
terminal operations owned during both comparable years for all other terminal operations those owned during the same months of both comparable years  earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in compared to  and decreased million in compared to  however  as described above  the net effect of the property casualty gain  hurricane repair expenses net of income tax  and environmental liability adjustments resulted in a million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in relative to  and a million decrease in relative to the remaining change in the earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses from terminal operations owned during both years consisted of a million increase in compared to  and a million increase in compared to these respective year to year increases in earnings primarily consisted of the following o increases of million and million  respectively  from our gulf coast region 
this region includes the operations of our two large gulf coast liquids terminal facilities located along the houston ship channel in pasadena and galena park  texas 
the two terminals serve as a distribution hub for houston s crude oil refineries  and since the end of  have contributed incremental earnings attributable to internal growth complemented by the completion of expansion projects undertaken to increase leaseable liquids capacity 
the year over year increase in earnings in versus was primarily revenue related  driven by increases from new and incremental customer agreements  additional liquids tank capacity from capital expansions at our pasadena terminal since the end of higher truck loading rack service fees  higher ethanol throughput  and incremental revenues from customer deficiency charges 
since the end of  we have obtained additional customer contracts  extended existing customer contracts and remarketed expiring contracted capacity at competitive rates 
for our gulf coast and other liquids terminals  our existing contracts generally mature at various times and in varying amounts of throughput capacity  therefore  we continue to manage our recontracting process in order to limit the risk of significant impacts on our revenues 
the increase in earnings in versus was also largely due to higher revenues  driven by higher sales of petroleum transmix  new customer agreements  and escalations in annual contract provisions  o an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from our mid atlantic region 
the increase was driven by a million increase from our shipyard river terminal  located in charleston  south carolina  a million increase from our fairless hills  pennsylvania bulk terminal  and a million increase from our north charleston  south carolina liquids terminal 
the increase from shipyard reflects higher revenues from liquids warehousing and coal and cement handling  the increase from fairless hills was due to higher volumes of steel imports and heavier shipping activity on the delaware river  and the increase from north charleston was due to higher revenues  associated with additional liquids tank leasing and a utilization capacity rate that approached full capacity 
the decrease in earnings in compared to included a million decrease in earnings from our pier ix bulk terminal  located in newport news  virginia  and a million decrease in earnings from our chesapeake bay facility  located in sparrows point  maryland 
the decrease from pier ix was primarily due to higher operating expenses in compared to  due to incremental operating expenses associated with a new synfuel maintenance program and higher demurrage expenses associated with increased cement imports 
the decrease from our chesapeake terminal was mainly due to higher operating expenses associated with higher movements of petroleum coke  o an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from terminals included in our texas petcoke region 
the increase in compared to was primarily revenue driven  resulting from a year over year increase in petroleum coke handling volumes 
the decrease in compared to was related to incremental overhead expenses allocated to our texas petcoke region  which was newly formed in april  o an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from terminals included in our lower mississippi river louisiana region 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to incremental earnings from our amory and delisle mississippi bulk terminals  and from higher earnings from our kinder morgan st 
gabriel  louisiana terminal 
our amory terminal began operations in july the higher earnings from our delisle terminal  which was negatively impacted by hurricane damage in  was primarily due to higher bulk transfer revenues in the increase from our st 
gabriel terminal was primarily due to a million income item  recognized in  related to a favorable settlement associated with the purchase of the terminal in september the overall decrease in earnings from our louisiana region terminals in compared to was largely related to the negative effects of the two gulf coast hurricanes in  resulting in an overall general loss of business 
in addition to property damage incurred  throughput at the facilities impacted by the storms decreased in compared to largely due to post hurricane production issues at a number of gulf coast refineries 
in  our terminals segment realized essentially all of our losses related to both hurricanes  and in total  the segment recognized million in expense in in order to meet its insurance deductible for hurricane katrina 
we also recognized another million to repair damaged facilities following hurricane rita  but estimates of lost business at our terminal sites are difficult because of insurance complexities and the extended recovery time involved  o an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from terminals included in our northeast region 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to higher earnings from our liquids terminals located in carteret  new jersey and staten island  new york 
the increase was largely due to higher revenues from new and renegotiated customer contracts at carteret  additional tankage available for lease at our kinder morgan staten island terminal  and an overall increase in petroleum imports to new york harbor  resulting in an increase in total liquids throughput at carteret and higher distillate volumes at our staten island terminal 
the decrease in compared to was driven by lower earnings from the dry bulk services at our port newark  new jersey facility 
the decrease was largely due to lower salt tonnage  shipping activity  and stevedoring services  all primarily due to warmer winter weather in  and o increases of million and million  respectively  from terminals in our midwest region 
the year over year increase in earnings in was mainly attributable to higher earnings from the combined operations of our argo and chicago  illinois liquids terminals  and from our cora  illinois coal terminal 
the increase from the liquids terminals was due to higher revenues from increased ethanol throughput and incremental liquids storage and handling business 
the year to year increase in earnings at cora was due to higher revenues resulting from an almost increase in coal transfer volumes 
the overall increase in compared to included higher earnings from our dakota bulk terminal  located along the mississippi river near st 
paul  minnesota  our argo  illinois liquids terminal  situated along the chicago sanitary and ship channel  and our milwaukee  wisconsin bulk commodity terminal 
the increase in earnings from dakota was primarily due to higher revenues generated by a cement unloading and storage facility  which began operations in late the increase from our argo terminal was mainly due to new customer contracts and higher ethanol handling revenues 
the increase from our milwaukee bulk terminal was mainly due to an increase in coal handling revenues related to higher coal truckage within the state of wisconsin 
segment details segment revenues from terminal operations owned during identical periods of both and increased million in  when compared to the prior year 
the overall increase was primarily due to the following o a million increase from our mid atlantic region  due primarily to higher revenues of million from fairless hills  million from shipyard river  and million from our north charleston terminals  all discussed above 
also  our philadelphia  pennsylvania liquids terminal reported a million increase in revenues in versus largely due to an increase in fuel grade ethanol volumes  annual rate escalations on certain customer contracts  and a liquids capacity utilization rate of approximately  o a million increase from our gulf coast liquids facilities  due primarily to higher revenues from pasadena and galena park  as discussed above  o a million increase from our texas petcoke terminal region  due primarily to higher petroleum coke transfer volumes  o a million increase from engineering and terminal design services  due to both incremental revenues from new clients  additional project phase revenues  and increased revenues from material sales  o a million increase from terminals included in our midwest region  due largely to the increased liquids throughput  storage and ethanol activities from our two chicago liquids terminals and to the increased coal volumes from our cora coal terminal  both described above 
the overall increase in revenues was also due to higher marine oil fuel and asphalt sales from our dravosburg  pennsylvania bulk terminal  o a million increase from our ferro alloys region  largely due to increased ores and metals handling at our chicago and industry  pennsylvania terminals  and o a million increase from our northeast terminals  largely due to the revenue increases at our carteret and kinder morgan staten island terminals  as discussed above 
for all bulk terminal facilities combined  total transloaded bulk tonnage volumes increased over in  when compared to the overall increase in bulk tonnage volumes included a increase in coal transfer volumes and a increase in ores metals transload volumes 
we also completed  in  capital expansion and betterment projects at certain of our liquids terminal facilities that included the construction of additional petroleum products storage tanks 
the construction  when combined with increases from external acquisitions  increased our liquids storage capacity by approximately million barrels in at the same time  we increased our liquids utilization capacity rate by  compared to the prior year 
our liquids terminals utilization rate is the ratio of our actual leased capacity to our estimated potential capacity 
potential capacity is generally derived from measures of total capacity  taking into account periodic changes to our terminal facilities due to additions  disposals  obsolescence  or other factors 
segment revenues for all terminals owned during identical periods of both and increased million in  when compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the following o a million increase from our pasadena and galena park gulf coast liquids terminals  due primarily to higher petroleum transmix sales and to additional customer contracts and tankage capacity  o a million increase from our midwest region  due primarily to higher cement handling revenues at our dakota terminal  increased tonnage at our milwaukee terminal  and higher marine fuel sales at our dravosburg  pennsylvania terminal  o a million increase from our mid atlantic region  due primarily to higher coal volumes and higher dockage revenues at our shipyard river terminal  higher cement  iron ore  and dockage revenues at our pier ix bulk terminal  and incremental revenues from our north charleston liquids bulk terminal  located just north of our shipyard facility and acquired effective april   o a million increase from our engineering and terminal design services  due to increased fee revenues discussed above  o a million increase from our southeast region  due primarily to both higher fertilizer and ammonia volumes and higher stevedoring services at our terminal operations located in and around the tampa  florida area 
these operations include the import and export business of our kinder morgan tampaplex terminal  the commodity transfer operations of our port sutton terminal  and the terminal stevedoring services we perform along tampa bay  and o a million decrease from terminals included in our louisiana region 
the decrease was largely due to the negative impact and business interruptions resulting from the two hurricanes that struck the gulf coast in the second half of operating expenses from all terminals owned during identical periods of both and increased million in compared to combined  the net effect of the environmental liability adjustments  hurricane repair expenses  and the property casualty gain on terminals owned during the same portions of both comparable periods resulted in a million decrease in segment operating expenses in relative to the remaining change in year to year operating expenses an increase of million from all terminals owned during identical periods of both and primarily consisted of the following o a million increase from engineering related services  due primarily to higher salary  overtime and other employee related expenses related to new hiring  as well as increased contract labor  all associated with the increased project work described above  o a million increase from our texas petcoke terminal region  due largely to higher labor expenses  rail service and railcar maintenance expenses  and harbor and barge expenses  all related to higher petroleum coke volumes  o a million increase from our mid atlantic terminals  largely due to higher operating and maintenance expenses at our fairless hills  shipyard river  and philadelphia terminals 
the increase at fairless hills was largely due to higher wharfage  trucking and general maintenance expenses  related to the increase in steel products handled 
the increase at shipyard was due to higher labor  equipment rentals and general maintenance expenses  all associated with increased tonnage 
the increase at our philadelphia liquids terminal was due to higher expenses related to certain environmental liability accruals  o a million increase from terminals in our ferro alloys region  due primarily to higher labor expenses and higher equipment maintenance and rental expenses  all related to increased ores and metals handling volumes  and o a million increase from our midwest region terminals  due primarily to higher marine fuel costs of sales expenses at our dravosburg terminal  higher maintenance and outside service expenses associated with increases in coal transfer volumes at our cora  illinois and grand rivers  kentucky coal terminals  and additional labor and equipment rental expenses from the combined operations of our argo and chicago  illinois liquids terminals  due to increased ethanol throughput and incremental liquids storage and handling business 
for terminal operations owned during the same months of both and  operating expenses increased million in compared to the overall increase included a million increase in expense attributable to the and environmental liability adjustments 
the remaining million increase in operating expenses in versus from terminal operations owned during both years primarily consisted of the following o a million increase from our mid atlantic terminals  largely due to higher operating  maintenance and labor expenses at our pier ix and chesapeake bay facilities  discussed above  and to higher operating  equipment maintenance and labor expenses at our shipyard river terminal  due to higher bulk tonnage volumes  o an million increase from our midwest region terminals  due primarily to higher expenses at our milwaukee  dravosburg and dakota bulk handling terminals 
the increase at our milwaukee bulk commodity terminal was due to increased trucking and maintenance expenses associated with the increase in coal volumes 
the increase at dravosburg was largely due to higher cost of sales expenses  due to marine oil purchasing costs and inventory maintenance  and the increase at our st 
paul  minnesota dakota bulk terminal was due to both higher repair and labor expenses  associated with higher cement volumes  and lower capitalized overhead in  due to the completion of its cement unloading and storage facility in late  o a million increase from our louisiana terminals  largely due to property damage  demurrage and other expenses  which in large part related to the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita in the last half of however  since the affected properties were insured  our expenses were limited to the amount of the deductible under our insurance policies  o a million increase from our pasadena and galena park gulf coast liquids terminals  due chiefly to higher labor  and higher fuel and power expenses associated with increased terminal activities  and o a million increase from the terminals in our west region  due mainly to higher labor expenses and port fees resulting from increased tonnage at our terminal facilities located at longview and vancouver  washington 
both facilities provide ship loading services along the columbia river 
the segment s earnings from equity investments remained flat across both and  when compared to prior years 
income from other items was essentially unchanged in versus  but increased million in compared to the increase in was chiefly due to the million income item related to a settlement associated with our kinder morgan st 
gabriel terminal  discussed above  and to a million increase related to a disposal loss  recognized in  on warehouse property at our elizabeth river bulk terminal  located in chesapeake  virginia 
income tax expenses totaled million in  million in and million in the million increase in versus reflects  among other things  incremental income tax expense associated with hurricane related income and expense items 
the million increase in compared to was mainly attributable to the year to year changes in both taxable income and certain permanent differences between taxable income and financial income of kinder morgan bulk terminals  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
kinder morgan bulk terminals  inc is the tax paying entity that owns many of our bulk terminal businesses which handle non qualifying products 
in general  the segment s income tax expenses will change period to period based on the classification of income before taxes between amounts earned by corporate subsidiaries and amounts earned by partnership subsidiaries 
non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges increased million in compared to and million in compared to the year over year increases in depreciation expenses reflect a rising depreciable capital base since the end of  with growth due to a combination of business acquisitions and internal capital spending 
collectively  the terminal assets we acquired since the beginning of and listed above accounted for incremental depreciation expenses of million in  and the assets we acquired since the third quarter of and listed above accounted for incremental depreciation expenses of million in the remaining increases in year to year depreciation expenses were associated with capital spending on numerous improvement projects completed since in order to expand and enhance our terminal services 
other year ended december  in thousands income expense general and administrative expenses a  unallocable interest  net  minority interest b  loss from early extinguishment of debt interest and corporate administrative expenses  a amount includes a decrease in expense of related to the allocation of general and administrative expenses on hurricane related capital expenditures for the replacement and repair of assets 
b amount includes an expense of  related to the allocation of international marine terminals earnings from hurricane income and expense items to minority interest 
items not attributable to any segment include general and administrative expenses  unallocable interest income  interest expense and minority interest 
we also included the million loss from our early extinguishment of debt in as an item not attributable to any business segment 
the loss from the early extinguishment of debt represented the excess of the price we paid to repurchase and retire the principal amount of million of tax exempt industrial revenue bonds over the bonds carrying value 
pursuant to certain provisions that gave us the right to call and retire the bonds prior to maturity  we took advantage of the opportunity to refinance at lower rates  and we included the million loss under the caption other  net in our accompanying consolidated statement of income 
for more information on this early extinguishment of debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
our general and administrative expenses include such items as salaries and employee related expenses  payroll taxes  insurance  office supplies and rentals  unallocated litigation and environmental expenses  and shared corporate services including accounting  information technology  human resources and legal services 
overall general and administrative expenses totaled million in  million in and million in generally  the year to year increases in our general and administrative expenses reflect increased spending levels in support of our growth initiatives  and we continue to aggressively manage our infrastructure expense and to focus on our productivity and expense controls 
the million increase in overall general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to higher corporate service charges and higher corporate and employee related insurance expenses in when compared to the prior year 
the increase in corporate services was largely due to higher corporate overhead expenses associated with the business operations we acquired since the end of the increase in insurance expenses was partly due to incremental expenses related to the cancellation of certain commercial insurance polices in the second quarter of  as well as to the overall variability in year to year commercial property and medical insurance costs 
pursuant to certain provisions that gave us the right to cancel certain commercial policies prior to maturity  we took advantage of the opportunity to reinsure at lower rates 
the overall increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was partly offset a million decrease in unallocated litigation and environmental settlement expenses and a million decrease in expense from the allocation of general and administrative overhead expenses to hurricane related capital projects 
the decrease in expense from unallocated litigation and environmental settlement expenses consisted of i a million expense in for a settlement reached between us and a former joint venture partner on our kinder morgan tejas natural gas pipeline system  and ii a cumulative million expense in related to settlements of environmental matters at certain of our operating sites located in the state of california 
for more information on our litigation matters  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was due to the incremental litigation and environmental settlement expenses of million described above  as well as higher expenses incurred from kmi s operation of our natural gas pipeline assets associated with higher actual costs in versus lower negotiated costs in  higher insurance expenses largely due to higher workers compensation claims and higher legal  benefits  and corporate secretary services expenses 
interest expense  net of unallocable interest income  totaled million in  million in and million in the million increase in net interest expense in compared to was due to both higher average debt levels and higher effective interest rates 
in  average borrowings excluding the market value of interest rate swaps increased and the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings increased  when compared to the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings was approximately during and during 
the increase in average borrowings was mainly due to higher capital spending in  the acquisition of external assets and businesses since the end of  and a net increase  since march  of million in principal amount of long term senior notes 
generally  we fund both our capital spending including payments for pipeline project construction costs and our acquisition outlays from borrowings under our commercial paper program 
the net changes in the principal amount of our senior notes relate to changes occurring on march  on that date  we both closed a public offering of million in principal amount of senior notes and retired a principal amount of million 
from time to time we issue senior notes in order to refinance our commercial paper borrowings 
for more information on our capital expansion and acquisition expenditures  see liquidity and capital resources investing activities 
the increase in our average borrowing rate in reflects a general rise in variable interest rates since the end of we use interest rate swap agreements to help manage our interest rate risk 
the swaps are contractual agreements we enter into in order to transform a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long term fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
however  in a period of rising interest rates  these swaps will result in period to period increases in our interest expense 
for more information on our interest rate swaps  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
the million increase in net interest charges in versus was also due to both higher average debt borrowings and higher effective interest rates 
our average debt balance increased in compared to  partly due to incremental borrowings made in connection with both internal capital spending and external acquisitions  and partly due to the net increase of million in principal amount of senior notes in march the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings increased in compared to  reflecting a general rise in interest rates since the end of minority interest  representing the deduction in our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our five operating limited partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries that are not held by us  totaled million in  million in and million in the overall million increase in compared to included a million increase attributable to the minority interest in the imt partnership s hurricane related income and expense items  as described above in terminals  and a million increase attributable to higher net income from overall net operating partnership income 
the overall million decrease in minority interest in compared to was chiefly due to lower net income allocated to the minority interest in the imt partnership in due to business interruption caused by hurricane katrina 
liquidity and capital resources capital structure we attempt to maintain a conservative overall capital structure  with a long term target mix of approximately equity and debt 
in addition to our results of operations  our debt and capital balances are affected by our financing activities  as discussed below in financing activities 
the following table illustrates the sources of our invested capital dollars in thousands december  long term debt  excluding market value of interest rate swaps minority interest partners capital  excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss total capitalization short term debt  less cash and cash equivalents total invested capital capitalization long term debt  excluding market value of interest rate swaps 
minority interest partners capital  excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss invested capital total debt  less cash and cash equivalents and excluding market value of interest rate swaps partners capital and minority interest  excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are debt service  sustaining capital expenditures  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from operations  we could meet our cash requirements for expansion capital expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility  issuing short term commercial paper  long term notes or additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr with the proceeds from issuances of kmr shares 
in general  we expect to fund o cash distributions and sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  o expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits with retained cash resulting from including i units in the determination of cash distributions per unit but paying quarterly distributions on i units in additional i units rather than cash  additional borrowings  the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr  o interest payments with cash flows from operating activities  and o debt principal payments with additional borrowings  as such debt principal payments become due  or by the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units to kmr 
as a publicly traded limited partnership  our common units are attractive primarily to individual investors  although such investors represent a small segment of the total equity capital market 
we believe that some institutional investors prefer shares of kmr over our common units due to tax and other regulatory considerations 
we are able to access this segment of the capital market through kmr s purchases of i units issued by us with the proceeds from the sale of kmr shares to institutional investors 
as part of our financial strategy  we try to maintain an investment grade credit rating  which involves  among other things  the issuance of additional limited partner units in connection with our acquisitions and internal growth activities in order to maintain acceptable financial ratios 
on may  s p and moody s each placed our ratings on credit watch pending resolution of a management buyout proposal for all of the outstanding shares of kmi 
on january   in anticipation of the buyout closing  s p downgraded us one level to bbb and removed our rating from credit watch with negative implications 
our debt credit ratings are currently rated bbb by standard poor s rating services  and baa by moody s investors service 
as noted by moody s in its credit opinion dated november   our rating is expected to be downgraded from baa to baa at the time moody s finalizes its ratings for kmi 
additionally  as noted by fitch in its press release dated august   our rating is expected to be downgraded from bbb to bbb at the time fitch finalizes its ratings for kmi 
at this time  neither moody s nor fitch have changed their ratings on kmi or us 
we are not able to predict with certainty the final outcome of the pending buyout proposal 
short term liquidity we employ a centralized cash management program that essentially concentrates the cash assets of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing 
our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries are concentrated  consolidated  or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group 
we place no restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities  payment of inter company balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities  provided  however  that our cash and the cash of our subsidiaries is not concentrated into accounts of kmi or any company not in our consolidated group of companies  and kmi has no rights with respect to our cash except as permitted pursuant to our partnership agreement

the payment related to a settlement agreement reached in may that resolved certain challenges by complainants with regard to delivery tariffs and gathering enhancement fees at our pacific operations watson station  located in carson  california 
the agreement called for estimated refunds to be paid into an escrow account pending final approval by the ferc  which was made in the third quarter of  o a million increase in cash from overall higher partnership income net of non cash items including depreciation charges  undistributed earnings from equity investments  non cash pipeline transportation rate case expenses  and gains from both the sale of assets and property casualty settlements 
the higher partnership income reflects an increase in cash earnings from our four reportable business segments in  as discussed above in results of operations 
the components of this overall million increase in operating cash inflows in compared to consisted of the following o a million increase from higher overall net income  o a million increase from higher non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  o a million increase from higher non cash earnings from our unconsolidated investees accounted for under the equity method of accounting  o a million decrease from the non cash operating expense attributable to an increase in our reserves related to our pacific operations rate case liability  and o a million decrease from non cash property related gains and losses primarily consisting of the million gain from the combined sale of our douglas natural gas gathering system and painter unit fractionation facility and the million gain from property casualty indemnifications  both recognized in  o a million increase related to higher distributions received from equity investments chiefly due to higher distributions received from red cedar gathering company in  when compared to the overall increase in distributions was partially offset by lower distributions from plantation pipe line company  due to lower overall partnership net income in versus the increase in distributions received from red cedar was due primarily to higher year over year net income in versus  and also from the fact that red cedar had higher capital expansion spending in  and funded a large portion of the expenditures with retained cash  and o a million increase in cash inflows relative to changes in non current assets and liabilities which represent offsetting changes in cash from various long term assets and liability accounts 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the prior year 
the million overall increase in funds utilized in investing activities was mainly attributable to o a million increase in capital expenditures driven by a million increase in capital spending from our natural gas pipelines business segment  largely due to the inclusion of rockies express pipeline llc s capital expenditures for the first six months of  and by incremental expenditures for both asset infrastructure expansions and hurricane repair and replacement costs 
we continue to make significant investments for both strategic acquisitions and internal growth projects  and including all expansion and maintenance projects  our capital expenditures were  million in compared to million in our sustaining capital expenditures totaled million in and million in sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset 
beginning in the third quarter of  our products pipelines and co business segments and our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group began recognizing certain costs incurred as part of their pipeline integrity management program as maintenance expense in the period incurred  and in addition  recorded an expense for costs previously capitalized as sustaining capital expenditures during the first six months of this change primarily affected our products pipelines business segment  reducing its earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses by million and reducing its sustaining capital expenditures by million  when compared to additionally  our forecasted expenditures for sustaining capital expenditures for are approximately million 
this amount has been forecasted primarily for the purchase of plant and equipment 
all of our capital expenditures  with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures  are discretionary  o an million increase due to higher expenditures made for strategic business acquisitions in  our acquisition outlays totaled million  which primarily consisted of million for the acquisition of entrega gas pipeline llc and million for the acquisition of bulk  liquids and refined products terminal operations and related assets 
in  our acquisition outlays totaled million  including cash outflows of million for the acquisition of our texas petroleum coke bulk terminal assets  million for our north dayton  texas natural gas storage facility  and million for the acquisition of our kinder morgan staten island liquids terminal 
both our and acquisition expenditures are discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  o a million decrease in cash used due to higher net proceeds of million received from both the sales of property  plant and equipment and other net assets  net of salvage and removal costs  and million from property insurance indemnities received in for damaged or destroyed property as a result of the hurricane season 
the increase from sales proceeds in versus was driven by i the million we received from momentum energy group  llc for the combined sale of our douglas natural gas gathering system and painter unit fractionation facility  and ii the million we received from the sale of certain oil and gas properties originally acquired from journey acquisition i  lp and journey  lp  and o a million decrease due to lower payments for natural gas stored underground and natural gas liquids pipeline line fill largely related to lower investments in underground natural gas storage volumes in compared to financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  while in the prior year  our financing activities used net cash of million 
the million overall increase in cash inflows provided by financing activities was primarily due to o a million increase from overall debt financing activities which include our issuances and payments of debt and our debt issuance costs 
the increase was primarily due to a million increase from higher net commercial paper borrowings in  partially offset by a million decrease due to both issuances and payments of senior notes during during each of the years and  we used our commercial paper borrowings to fund our asset acquisitions  capital expansion projects and other partnership activities 
we subsequently raised funds to refinance a portion of those borrowings by issuing additional common units and  in only  completing public offerings of senior notes 
we used the proceeds from these debt and equity issuances to reduce our borrowings under our commercial paper program 
furthermore  the increase in our commercial paper debt includes net borrowings of million under the commercial paper program of rockies express pipeline llc 
we held a ownership interest in rockies express pipeline llc until june   and according to the provisions of generally accepted accounting principles  we included its cash inflows and outflows in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the first six months of on june   following conocophillips acquisition of a ownership interest in westeast pipeline llc and its subsidiary rockies express pipeline llc  we deconsolidated westeast pipeline llc and we have subsequently accounted for our investment under the equity method of accounting 
following the change to the equity method on june   rockies express debt balances were no longer included in our consolidated balance sheet and its cash inflows and outflows for all periods subsequent to june were not included in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
the decrease in cash inflows from changes in our senior notes related to debt activities occurring on march  on that date  we both closed a public offering of million in principal amount of senior notes and repaid million of senior notes that matured on that date 
the senior notes are due march  we received proceeds from the issuance of the notes  after underwriting discounts and commissions  of approximately million  and we used the proceeds to repay the senior notes and to reduce our commercial paper debt  o a million increase from contributions from minority interests principally due to contributions of million received in from sempra energy with regard to its ownership interest in rockies express pipeline llc 
the contribution from sempra included an amount of million  contributed in the first quarter of  for sempra s original share of the purchase price of entrega gas pipeline llc 
in april  rockies express pipeline llc merged with and into entrega gas pipeline llc  and the surviving entity was renamed rockies express pipeline llc  o a million increase from net changes in cash book overdrafts which represent checks issued but not yet endorsed 
the increase reflects a higher amount of outstanding checks in  due to timing differences in the payments of year end accruals and outstanding vendor invoices in versus  o a million decrease from higher partnership distributions distributions to all partners  consisting of our common and class b unitholders  our general partner and minority interests  totaled  million in  compared to million in the overall increase in period to period distributions included minority interest distributions of million paid from our rockies express pipeline llc subsidiary to sempra energy in the first half of the distributions to sempra and distributions to us for our proportionate ownership interest were made in conjunction with rockies express establishment of and subsequent borrowings under its commercial paper program during the second quarter of  as discussed above 
during the second quarter of  rockies express both issued a net amount of million of commercial paper and distributed million to its member owners 
prior to the establishment of its commercial paper program supported by its five year unsecured revolving credit agreement  rockies express funded its acquisition of entrega gas pipeline llc and its rockies express pipeline construction costs with contributions from both us and sempra 
excluding the minority interest distributions to sempra  overall distributions increased million in  when compared to the increase primarily resulted from higher distributions of available cash  as described below in partnership distributions 
the increase in available cash distributions in versus was due to an increase in the per unit cash distributions paid  an increase in the number of units outstanding and an increase in our general partner incentive distributions 
we paid distributions of per unit in compared to per unit in the increase in distributions paid per unit principally resulted from favorable operating results in the increase in our general partner incentive distributions resulted from both increased cash distributions per unit and an increase in the number of common units and i units outstanding 
we also distributed  and  i units in quarterly distributions during and  respectively  to kmr  our sole i unitholder 
the amount of i units distributed in each quarter was based upon the amount of cash we distributed to the owners of our common and class b units during that quarter of and for each outstanding i unit that kmr held  a fraction of an i unit was issued 
the fraction was determined by dividing the cash amount distributed per common unit by the average of kmr s shares closing market prices for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the date on which the shares began to trade ex dividend under the rules of the new york stock exchange  and o a million decrease in cash inflows from common unit equity issuances primarily related to the incremental cash we received from our two separate common unit issuances over the cash received from our single common unit issuance 
in both and  we used the proceeds from each of these issuances to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program 
in an august public offering  we issued an additional of our common units at a price of  less commissions and underwriting expenses 
after all fees  we received net proceeds of million for the issuance of these common units 
in  we received aggregate proceeds of million from two separate common unit equity issuances  consisting of the following amounts are net of all commissions and underwriting expenses o million received from our issuance of  common units in an august public offering  and o million received from our issuance of  common units in a november public offering 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash  as defined in our partnership agreement  to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  including cash received by our operating partnerships and net reductions in reserves  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves and amounts payable to the former general partner of sfpp  lp in respect of its remaining interest in sfpp 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement  which discretion has been delegated to kmr  subject to the approval of our general partner in certain cases  to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  rate refunds and distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when kmr determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows to identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
for  and  we distributed approximately  and  respectively  of the total of cash receipts less cash disbursements calculations assume that kmr unitholders received cash 
the difference between these numbers and of distributable cash flow reflects net changes in reserves 
our general partner and owners of our common units and class b units receive distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives distributions in additional i units 
we do not distribute cash to i unit owners but retain the cash for use in our business 
however  the cash equivalent of distributions of i units is treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to our general partner 
each time we make a distribution  the number of i units owned by kmr and the percentage of our total units owned by kmr increase automatically under the provisions of our partnership agreement 
available cash is initially distributed to our limited partners and to our general partner 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions to be paid to our general partner in the event that quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed certain specified targets 
available cash for each quarter is distributed o first  to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  o second  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  o third  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  and o fourth  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata  to owners of common units and class b units in cash and to owners of i units in the equivalent number of i units  and to our general partner 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate value of cash and i units being distributed 
our general partner s incentive distribution that we declared for was million  while the incentive distribution paid to our general partner during was million 
the difference between declared and paid distributions is due to the fact that our distributions for the fourth quarter of each year are declared and paid in the first quarter of the following year 
under the terms of our partnership agreement  our distributions to unitholders for required incentive distributions to our general partner in the amount of million  however  due to the fact that we did not meet our budget target  we had no obligation to fund our bonus plan for the executive officers of our general partner and kmr  and for the employees of kmgp services company  inc and kmi who operate our businesses 
the board of directors of kmi determined that it was in kmi s long term interest to fund a partial payout of our bonuses through a reduction in the general partner s incentive distribution and accordingly  our general partner  with the approval of the compensation committees and boards of kmi and kmr  waived million of its incentive distribution for the fourth quarter of the waived amount approximates an amount equal to our actual bonus payout for  which is approximately of our budgeted full bonus payout for of million 
including the effect of this waiver  our distributions to unitholders for resulted in payments of incentive distributions to our general partner in the amount of million 
on february   we paid a quarterly distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of this distribution was greater than the distribution per unit we paid for the fourth quarter of and greater than the distribution per unit we paid for the first quarter of we paid this distribution in cash to our common unitholders and to our class b unitholders 
kmr  our sole i unitholder  received additional i units based on the cash distribution per common unit 
we believe that future operating results will continue to support similar levels of quarterly cash and i unit distributions  however  no assurance can be given that future distributions will continue at such levels 
litigation and environmental as of december   we have recorded a total reserve for environmental claims  without discounting and without regard to anticipated insurance recoveries  in the amount of million 
in addition  we have recorded a receivable of million for expected cost recoveries that have been deemed probable 
the reserve is primarily established to address and clean up soil and ground water impacts from former releases to the environment at facilities we have acquired or accidental spills or releases at facilities that we own 
reserves for each project are generally established by reviewing existing documents  conducting interviews and performing site inspections to determine the overall size and impact to the environment 
reviews are made on a quarterly basis to determine the status of the cleanup and the costs associated with the effort 
in assessing environmental risks in conjunction with proposed acquisitions  we review records relating to environmental issues  conduct site inspections  interview employees  and  if appropriate  collect soil and groundwater samples 
additionally  as of december   we have recorded a total reserve for legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities in the amount of million 
the reserve is primarily related to various claims from lawsuits arising from our pacific operations pipeline transportation rates  and the contingent amount is based on both the circumstances of probability and reasonability of dollar estimates 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these claims in order to determine the adequacy of our liability provision 
as of december   our total reserve for legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities amounted to million 
though no assurance can be given  we believe we have established adequate environmental and legal reserves such that the resolution of pending environmental matters and litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business  cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
pursuant to our continuing commitment to operational excellence and our focus on safe  reliable operations  we have implemented  and intend to implement in the future  enhancements to certain of our operational practices in order to strengthen our environmental and asset integrity performance 
these enhancements have resulted and may result in higher operating costs and sustaining capital expenditures  however  we believe these enhancements will provide us the greater long term benefits of improved environmental and asset integrity performance 
please refer to notes and  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding pending litigation  environmental and asset integrity matters 
regulation the pipeline safety improvement act of requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as high consequence areas 
pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests within ten years of december   the date of enactment  and must perform subsequent integrity tests on a seven year cycle 
at least of the highest risk segments must be tested within five years of the enactment date 
the risk ratings are based on numerous factors  including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline  as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating 
testing will consist of hydrostatic testing  internal electronic testing  or direct assessment of the piping 
a similar integrity management rule for refined petroleum products pipelines became effective may  all baseline assessments for products pipelines must be completed by march we have included all incremental expenditures estimated to occur during associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of and the integrity management of our products pipelines in our budget and capital expenditure plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 
energy commodity market risk we are exposed to commodity market risk and other external risks  such as weather related risk  in the ordinary course of business 
however  we take steps to hedge  or limit our exposure to  these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream 
stated another way  we execute a hedging strategy that seeks to protect our financial position against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses 
our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
the derivative contracts we use include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and over the counter markets  including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps and basis swaps 
fundamentally  our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our position in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change 
for example  as sellers of crude oil and natural gas  we often enter into fixed price swaps and or futures contracts to guarantee or lock in the sale price of our oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery  thereby directly offsetting any change in prices  either positive or negative 
a hedge is successful when gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 
our risk management policies prohibit us from engaging in speculative trading and we are not a party to leveraged derivatives 
furthermore  our policies require that we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors  and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties credit ratings 
while we enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we purchase energy commodity derivative contracts are as follows credit rating morgan stanley a j 
aron company goldman sachs aa bnp paribas aa we account for our energy commodity risk management derivative contracts according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities after amendment by sfas no 
 sfas no 
 and sfas no 

according to the provisions of sfas no 
 derivatives are measured at fair value and recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities  and in general  gains and losses on derivatives are reported on the income statement 
however  as discussed above  our principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
using derivative contracts to help provide us certainty with regard to our operating cash flows helps us undertake further capital improvement projects  attain budget results and meet distribution targets to our partners 
sfas no 
categorizes such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but whose value is uncertain 
cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions  as opposed to the value of an asset  liability or firm commitment  and sfas no 
prescribes special hedge accounting treatment for such derivatives 
in accounting for cash flow hedges  gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income  outside net income reported in our consolidated statements of income  but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income 
that is  for cash flow hedges  all effective components of the derivative contracts gains and losses goes to other comprehensive income  pending occurrence of the expected transaction 
other comprehensive income consists of those financial items that are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income 
thus  in highly effective cash flow hedges  where there is no ineffectiveness  other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings 
all remaining gains and losses on the derivative contracts the ineffective portion are included in current net income 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the derivative contract and the effective portion of that gain or loss 
in addition  when the hedged forecasted transaction does take place and affects earnings  the effective part of the hedge is also recognized in the income statement  and the earlier recognized effective amounts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if the forecasted transaction results in an asset or liability  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss should be reclassified into earnings when the asset or liability affects earnings through cost of sales  depreciation  interest expense  etc 
under current accounting rules  the accumulated components of other comprehensive income are to be reported separately as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
accordingly  our application of sfas no 
has resulted in deferred net loss amounts of million and  million being included within accumulated other comprehensive loss in the partners capital section of our accompanying balance sheets as of december  and december  respectively 
for us  the gains and losses that are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets are primarily related to the derivative contracts associated with our hedging of anticipated future cash flows from the sales and purchases of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil and represent the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative contacts 
in future periods  as the hedged cash flows from our actual purchases and sales of energy commodities affect our net income  the related gains and losses included in our accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of our hedging are transferred to the income statement as well  effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk 
we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the mark to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
the value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day is chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
derivative contracts evaluated by the model include commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
for each of the years ended december  and  value at risk reached a high of million and million  respectively  and a low of million and million  respectively 
value at risk as of december   was million and averaged million for value at risk as of december   was million and averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed above  we enter into these derivative contracts solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and  therefore  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivative contracts  with the exception of a minor amount of hedging inefficiency  is offset by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions

interest rate risk in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure  it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
as of december  and  the carrying values of our fixed rate debt were approximately  million and  million  respectively 
these amounts compare to  as of december  and  fair values of  million and  million  respectively 
fair values were determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change approximately basis points in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for and  respectively  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of our variable rate debt  including associated accrued interest and excluding market value of interest rate swaps  was  million as of december  and million as of december  a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings  when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december  and  respectively  including adjustments for notional swap amounts  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in our and annual pre tax earnings 
as of both december  and  we were a party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of billion 
an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal  which is called the notional principal amount 
normally at each payment or settlement date  the party who owes more pays the net amount  so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment 
the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal 
we entered into our interest rate swap agreements for the purposes of o hedging the interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate debt obligations  and o transforming a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long term fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
since the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest  we enter into swap agreements to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest 
such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest  and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 
as of december   all of our interest rate swap agreements represented fixed for variable rate swaps  where we agreed to pay our counterparties a variable rate of interest on a notional principal amount of billion  comprised of principal amounts from various series of our long term fixed rate senior notes 
in exchange  our counterparties agreed to pay us a fixed rate of interest  thereby allowing us to transform our fixed rate liabilities into variable rate obligations without the incurrence of additional loan origination or conversion costs 
we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements 
in general  we attempt to maintain an overall target mix of approximately fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
as of december   our cash and investment portfolio did not include fixed income securities 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio
