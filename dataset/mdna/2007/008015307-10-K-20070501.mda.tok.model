overview the trend in the aerospace industry is toward digital cockpits as the aerospace industry moves away from mechanical cockpit instrumentation that was the foundation of the company 
the company has made considerable progress in developing electronic instrumentation that is integrated into cockpit flight management systems to replace mechanical instrumentation that the company had previously offered to its customers 
the company is currently developing digital display instrumentation to further replace mechanical instrumentation in its product line to broaden its offering to customers who may want to upgrade their cockpits 
the company has increased its research and development expenditures to facilitate this upgrade in its product line as it anticipates further movement toward digital cockpits in the aerospace industry  positioning itself in a market niche where it has the ability to offer both digital and mechanical instrumentation 
while the company believes that this strategy strengthens its position in the aerospace industry  it cannot guarantee that this strategy will be successful 
an additional trend in the aerospace industry is toward system integration by the oems 
while the company currently maintains direct relationships with oems  it anticipates that oem suppliers will need to align themselves with integrators in order to preserve its position on future aircraft platforms 
the company also has significant business tied to military programs 
as a consequence  the company s business can fluctuate depending on government spending on military programs for which the company supplies its products 
while the company has been successful in obtaining contracts to supply military needs in recent years  changes in government spending could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s future military business 
likewise  changes in the commercial sector of the aerospace industry can have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s future business 
while the company has invested heavily in product development for both funded and unfunded programs  oem requirements may change such that additional product development efforts will be necessary to maintain or increase the company s revenue in the aerospace industry 
as the company endeavors to increase its international presence  its exposure to international economic changes as well as foreign currency risk may increase 
while the company may manage this exposure with appropriate resources  it cannot guarantee that such risks will be fully mitigated 
results of operations revenues revenues decreased  or  to  for fiscal year  from  for fiscal year this decrease was largely driven by a reduction in revenue recognition for the jsf development program of approximately  as that program nears completion 
in addition  shipments for spare parts decreased  as customers curtailed orders for replacement parts for primarily military applications  while revenues for non recurring engineering projects declined approximately  these reductions were partially offset by increase in repair revenues of approximately  and core product revenues of approximately  revenues increased  or  to  for fiscal year  from  for fiscal year this increase was largely driven by shipments of imfps  particularly the initiation of imfp shipments to korea aerospace 
in addition  volume for core instrument revenues increased approximately  and recognition of revenue for the joint strike fighter jsf development program increased approximately  cost of sales cost of sales decreased  or  to  or of revenues  for fiscal year from  or of revenues  for fiscal year this decrease in cost was primarily due to lower revenues 
increases in manufacturing efficiencies yielded greater throughput that helped offset the impact of reductions in high margin spare parts sales  thus allowing margins to remain relatively flat despite the reduction in revenue that was largely high margin products 
in addition  continuing cost increases on the jsf program  due to changes in requirements as described in the section entitled revenue recognition below  adversely affected cost of sales and gross margin 
cost of sales increased  or  to  or of revenues  for fiscal year from  or of revenues  for fiscal year this increase in cost was primarily due to higher revenues  while increases in manufacturing efficiencies yielded greater throughput that reduced overall costs as a percentage of revenues 
however  margins on the jsf development program were negative  as the rate of growth in jsf program costs incurred exceeded the rate of growth in revenues recognized  partially offsetting the effect of increased manufacturing throughput 
negotiations with lockheed martin  the customer for the jsf program  resulted in changes to the focus of remaining activities related to product development for the jsf 
this refocus of activities has resulted in a change to the estimate to complete the project  and the company now estimates its overall loss on the project to be approximately  the company continues to recognize the losses throughout the program as revisions to the estimate are identified 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased  to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from  or of revenue for fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in research and development r d costs as the company completed nearly all of its r d activities in house 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs due to a substantial increase in commission based sales to customers in asia as well as increased travel costs as the company pursued new business opportunities 
sg a expenses decreased  or  to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from  or of revenue for fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in r d costs as the transition of projects from outside contractors to internal engineering staff was completed early in fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales commissions due to a substantial increase in sales to customers in asia 
interest expense net interest expense increased  or  to  in fiscal year from net interest expense of  in fiscal year the net interest expense increase was due to higher average interest rates during the year as well as lower average cash balances due a repurchase of some of the company s outstanding stock  offsetting the benefit of lower average outstanding debt 
net interest expense increased  or  to  in fiscal year from net interest expense of  in fiscal year the net interest expense increase was due to higher average interest rates during the year  offsetting the benefit of lower average outstanding debt as well as interest income earned on accumulated excess cash 
other income expense other income expense decreased  to  in fiscal year from other income expense of  in fiscal year the decrease in miscellaneous income from the prior year was primarily due to a slightly lower incidence of asset sales 
other income expense decreased  to  in fiscal year from other income expense of  in fiscal year miscellaneous income in fiscal year was primarily provided by foreign exchange gains on british pound denominated transactions 
the decrease in miscellaneous income from the prior year was due to the non recurrence of substantial one time items that included the receipt of an insurance settlement of approximately  in may related to the june fire in the machine shop at the company s clearwater instruments location as well as the receipt of net proceeds of approximately  related to the sale of the company s engine vibration monitoring system evms product line inventory in february the sales price of the evms product line was approximately  and the costs related to this sale included inventory that was sold of approximately  inventory that was made obsolete by the sale of approximately  and legal fees of approximately  the increases in other income  net were partially offset by the recognition of a liability of approximately  related to the anticipated settlement of the company s class action litigation 
income tax expense income tax expense was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to a benefit of  for fiscal year the effective tax rate increased to in fiscal year from a benefit of in fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a substantial reduction in the availability of extraterritorial income tax credits due to lower international sales as well as a reduction in the amount of credits permitted for the current tax year 
the company has recognized extraterritorial income tax benefits of approximately  in fiscal year derived from non us sales activity for the fiscal year ended january  income tax expense was a benefit of  for fiscal year as compared to a benefit of  for fiscal year the effective tax benefit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a substantial increase in operating income when compared to the tax effect of the lower level of operating income in fiscal year as well as the impact of the change in the deferred tax valuation allowance recognized in fiscal year however  the company has recognized extraterritorial income tax benefits of approximately  in fiscal year derived from non us sales activity for the fiscal years ended january  through income net income decreased  or to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from  or of revenue  for fiscal year earnings per share decreased to for fiscal year from in fiscal year net income increased  or to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from  or of revenue  for fiscal year earnings per share increased to for fiscal year from in fiscal year inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  the company cannot predict the future effects of inflation 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal year as compared to cash provided by operating activities of  for fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to lower progress billings to and collections from lockheed for the jsf development program as well as reductions in accounts payable due to lower manufacturing activity 
in addition  the receipts of federal income tax refunds were lower while accounts receivable increased 
although revenues were lower  accounts receivable increased due to a substantial account receivable from one customer that was resolved shortly after the end of the fiscal year 
the february collection for this customer was approximately  these factors were offset by the impact of reductions in inventories and prepaid expenses 
cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal year as compared to cash provided by operating activities of  for fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in progress billings to lockheed for the jsf development program as well as the receipt of federal income tax refunds for the fiscal year ended january  higher volume resulted in the use of cash to fund increases in accounts receivable and inventories to sustain the increased activity level 
in addition  cash outflows for prepaid expenses increased as the company began utilizing its excess cash to pay its insurance premiums  discontinuing the practice of utilizing premium financing for this purpose 
cash used in investing activities was  for fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year these expenditures were primarily made to sustain existing business activity 
cash used in investing activities was  for fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year these expenditures were primarily made to sustain existing business activity 
cash used in financing activities was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to cash used of  in fiscal year the majority of this cash usage was due to the repurchase of  shares of the company s outstanding stock on march   while the remainder was the result of paying down long term debt as scheduled 
cash used in financing activities was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to cash used of  in fiscal year this cash usage was entirely the result of paying down long term debt as scheduled 
to accommodate fluctuations in cash flow  the company has a million revolving credit facility with wachovia bank  na wachovia  which is set to expire in june although unused as of january   this revolving credit facility remains fully available for the company s short term financing needs 
the company intends to negotiate a new credit line with wachovia  and will endeavor to obtain terms and conditions that are at least equal to if not better than the existing terms and conditions 
however  the company cannot guarantee the outcome of these negotiations 
note to the financial statements provides details of the company s refinancing of its principal debt with wachovia on february  the wachovia refinancing 
the debt facilities provided by the wachovia refinancing consist of a  term loan  the aforementioned revolving credit facility and a  term loan 
the proceeds from the wachovia refinancing were used to repay all of the company s debt obligations to first commercial bank and suntrust bank na the repayment of the company s debt to first commercial bank and suntrust bank  na was at stated value  and therefore resulted in no gain or loss 
the company s long term debt agreements with wachovia contain certain financial and other restrictive covenants  including the requirement to maintain i at all times  a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth that does not exceed to and ii at the end of each fiscal quarter  a cash flow coverage ratio with regard to the ratio of cash flow to the debt service of at least to 
the wachovia loan agreement subjects the company to a number of additional covenants that  among other things  require the company to obtain consent from the lender prior to making a material change of management  prior to making a guarantee of or otherwise becoming responsible for obligations of any other person or entity or assuming or becoming liable for any debt  contingent or direct  in excess of the company is also required to provide wachovia with its interim quarterly financial statements within days of the close of each fiscal quarter and its annual financial statements within days of the close of each fiscal year 
as of january   the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants 
the company s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and compliance with covenants in fiscal year and beyond is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results 
failure to achieve expected operating results and compliance with covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and operations in fiscal year and beyond  and could require implementation of further measures  including  but not limited to  deferring planned capital expenditures  reducing discretionary spending  and  if necessary  selling assets 
in addition  future capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including research and development  expansion of products lines  and other factors 
management believes that cash and cash equivalents  together with the company s cash flow from operations and current borrowing arrangements  will provide for these necessary capital expenditures 
furthermore  the company may develop and introduce new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures  invest or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments  which would require additional resources 
as shown in the table below  as of january   there were liquidation payments that were due with respect to long term debt and other contractual obligations in fiscal year and beyond payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years after years purchase commitments    long term debt     operating leases    total contractual cash obligations   the long term debt carries an interest obligation equal to the one month libor interest rate plus basis points 
as of january   the annualized amount of interest for the january  long term debt balance of approximately  would be approximately  the company s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity in fiscal year and beyond is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results and renewing its credit line 
the company s credit facilities with wachovia  as discussed above  include a million credit line that is set to expire on june  failure to renew that line of credit or failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our operations in fiscal year  and could require us to consider further measures  including  but not limited to  deferring planned capital expenditures  reducing discretionary spending and  if necessary  selling assets 
acquisitions currently  the company has no present arrangements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions 
nevertheless  the company continues to monitor and evaluate acquisition opportunities 
the company s ability to consummate any acquisitions  including a merger with another entity  is substantially limited by covenants in the company s long term debt documents 
environmental matters in accordance with a consent agreement with the department of environmental protection signed by the company in  the company s environmental consultant developed an interim remedial action plan the remedial plan to contain and remediate certain soil and groundwater contamination that had been discovered at the company s clearwater  florida location 
the contamination was discovered after a series of site investigations that revealed impacts to both shallow soils and groundwater that may have resulted from the accidental loss of solvents and metalworking fluids as well as activities from neighboring property over a period of years or more 
although the exact cause of the contamination has never been ascertained  the company nonetheless accepted responsibility for remediating the pollutants that were discovered on its property 
during  the company recorded a provision of approximately  related to the estimated costs to be incurred under the remedial plan 
as of january   the company had utilized all amounts originally recorded in other accrued expenses  and the remediation phase of the remedial plan had been completed 
during the third quarter of  management determined the post remediation monitoring expense related to the environmental cleanup of would cost approximately  this amount was accrued and expensed during the third quarter of as of january   all existing reserve balances had been utilized 
based upon an assessment by the company s environmental consultants  the company s management has calculated the company s expected future expenditure for post remediation monitoring expense and has established a reserve of  for such expense as of january  the company is now in a monitoring only stage of the remediation where periodic measurements are taken by environmental consultants to determine the effectiveness of the remediation 
the existing reserve contemplates the remaining expected expenses  based upon advice from the company s environmental consultants  as of january  the following table is a recap of the financial impact of the company s environmental activities years ended january  beginning reserve balance    costs incurred    replenish reserve for costs incurred  increase in estimate  ending reserve balance    critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of those financial statements and this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure items  including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and as a result of trends and uncertainties identified above under results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and in item a 
risk factors 
further  such differences could be material 
set forth below is a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies 
the company considers critical accounting policies to be those i that require the company to make estimates that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  ii for which a different estimate which could have been made would have a material impact on the company s financial statements  iii that are the most important and pervasive policies utilized  and iv that are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
additionally  the policies discussed below are critical to an understanding of the financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are highly uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on business operations is discussed throughout this md a where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition the company manufactures most of its products on a build to order basis and ships products upon completion 
the company has a policy of strict adherence to the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin sab in order to accurately state its revenues in each accounting period 
for certain situations  some judgment is required  but most sales have clear revenue recognition criteria 
revenue sources for product sales are largely from sales to commercial and government customers 
the majority of customer sales terms are fob origin  although some customer terms are fob destination 
for those customers where terms are origin  revenue is generally recognized upon shipment  unless additional prevailing factors would not be in accordance with the revenue recognition requirements of sab for those customers whose terms are destination  revenue is generally not recognized until goods arrive at the customers premises and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the company experiences a certain degree of sales returns that varies over time 
generally  such returns occur within no more than days after shipment by the company to its customers 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas revenue recognition when right of return exists  the company is able to make a reasonable estimation of expected sales returns based upon history and as contemplated by the requirements of sfas for example  sales returns may occur if delivery schedules are changed by customers after products have shipped or if products are received by customers but do not meet specifications 
in such cases  customers may choose to return products to the company 
absent such circumstances  customers do not have a right to return products if the company has met all contractual obligations 
previously  the company had established a sales return reserve that approximated an expected level of sales returns over a day period 
the company s experience with respect to sales returns for the fiscal years ended january  and has changed such that a reserve for sales returns has been provided due to experience and the reasonable possibility that certain customers will continue with such chargebacks 
from time to time  the company will jointly develop products with its customers for future applications 
in such circumstances  the company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for the contract 
this method is used because management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts 
the percentage of completion contract costs include direct labor  material  subcontracting costs  test facilities  and other indirect costs as allocated 
other operating costs are charged to expense as incurred 
during fiscal  the company secured one long term fixed price contract for the development of instrumentation for the jsf program 
costs and estimated earnings on this contract as of january  and are as follows january  january  costs incurred to date   estimated losses   less billings to date   costs less estimated losses in excess of billings  billings in excess of costs less estimated losses  the billings in excess of cost less estimated losses are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the balance sheets 
further discussions with the company s customer for the jsf program have resulted in product modifications that include making the product design more responsive to conditions as well as a change to accommodate differing system needs 
consequently  the company has revised its estimate at completion for the jsf program 
the estimated costs of the project increased by approximately  and  as a result  estimated total program costs exceed estimated program revenues by approximately  the company recognized this additional loss in its financial statements for the fiscal year ended january  these design changes are in addition to many issues encountered throughout the year related to testing and verification of the design change  resulting in increased expenditures for the program 
the company recognized these additional losses in fiscal year as the likelihood of incurring those losses were identified 
the jsf program is a customer funded product development program that is presently expected to generate total project revenues of approximately  as of january   based on project progress  the company has recognized revenues of approximately  for the jsf program 
the jsf program represents a significant investment in the company s future product development capabilities 
while company management is expending considerable effort to control costs and complete the development process on schedule  the key benefit to the program is the substantial revenue that the company may earn if it is awarded the competitive production contract for the jsf 
the production contract is expected to be awarded near the conclusion of the development program  and is presently expected to occur in late there is no assurance that production will begin after the completion of the development program or that the company will be awarded the production contract 
occasionally the company enters into research and development contracts with customers 
the company accounts for such contracts on the basis of the lesser of non refundable cash versus percentage of completion 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses the company continuously evaluates its customers and provides reserves for anticipated credit losses as soon as collection becomes compromised 
the company does maintain a limited reserve in anticipation that smaller accounts may become a collection issue  which occurs from time to time based on historical experience 
however  most of the company s customers are financially sound and the company s history of bad debts is relatively low 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory losses and residual value losses the company values inventory at the lower of cost using a method that approximates the first in  first out method or net realizable value 
reviews of inventory quantities on hand have been conducted to determine if usage or sales history supports maintaining inventory values at full cost or if it has instead become necessary to record a provision for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although the company endeavors to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and consequently reported operating results 
work in process inventories management employs certain methods to estimate the value of work in process inventories for financial reporting purposes 
company practice has been to conduct cycle counts of inventory at its clearwater  florida and earlysville  virginia operations throughout the year 
generally  for items that are in process at the end of a fiscal year  management will make an estimate during the cycle counting process regarding the percentage of completion of such items in order to accurately reflect costs incurred to date on the production of the items that are still in process 
these estimates are affected by the nature of the operation at which the items are located at the time a physical inventory is conducted  and are subject to judgment 
this practice was employed for the fiscal years ended january  and manufacturing overhead cost application the company establishes its inventoriable cost of manufacturing overhead by calculating its overhead costs as a percentage of direct labor and applying that percentage to direct labor that has been charged to inventory on a twelve month rolling average basis 
this application percentage is reviewed at least quarterly and is adjusted at least annually 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against the future benefit of deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits associated with the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
long lived assets the useful lives of property  plant and equipment for purposes of computing depreciation are land improvements years buildings and improvements years machinery and equipment years patterns  dies  and tools years furniture and fixtures years management periodically evaluates long lived assets for potential impairment and will record an impairment charge whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
as of january  and  management does not believe that any assets are impaired 
the company will capitalize production costs for computer software that is to be utilized as an integral part of a product when both a technological feasibility is established for the software and b all research and development activities for the other components of the product have been completed 
amortization is charged to expense at the greater of the expected unit sales versus units sold or the straight line method for a period of three years from the date the product becomes available for general release to customers 
other accounts affected by management estimates from time to time  management will utilize estimates when preparing the financial statements of the company 
such areas include amortization and other accruals 
the company has established a provision for warranty claims in anticipation of a certain degree of warranty activity  which generally is a minimal expense 
for the fiscal years ended january  and  the company did experience one time warranty costs related to specific applications for its aoa transmitter for one customer in and its imfp for another customer in the provision  which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the balance sheet  is based upon recent warranty experience excluding such one time  non recurring items 
the company s warranty experience is as follows for the years ended january  beginning reserve balance    costs incurred    replenish reserve for costs incurred   increase decrease in estimate 
  ending reserve balance    aoa one time expense  imfp one time expense  the following table summarizes significant areas which require management estimates as of january  allowance for doubtful accounts    reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory  warranty reserve    environmental reserve    reserve for sales returns   in addition to the items noted in the above table  management uses estimates in calculating the percentage of completion of the jsf program 
these estimates have a significant impact on costs and estimated losses in excess of billings included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
management also uses estimates in the calculation of depreciation and amortization on its property  plant and equipment and loan costs 
the following table summarizes depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended january  depreciation    amortization    recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
the first step is recognition the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as of the date of issue of this annual report on form k  the company is still evaluating the impact of fin on its future results of operations 
the company plans to adopt fin beginning with its first interim reporting period for fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk exposure for the company is interest rate risk 
the company s existing debt facilities require the payment of interest at a variable rate equal to one month libor plus basis points 
consequently  the company has an exposure to fluctuations in the underlying interest rate for its debt facilities 
as an example  the prevailing rate for one month libor at january  was 
therefore  the company s borrowing cost under its existing debt facilities as of january  was 
for each million of borrowing at the january  one month libor interest rate  the company s annual interest cost would be  significant fluctuations in the underlying libor interest rate index could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
presently  the company does not utilize any financial instruments to manage this interest rate risk 
the company also has a market risk exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company has a limited number of purchase and sale transactions that are denominated in british pounds 
the company s strategy in managing this risk exposure is to match the timing of british pound denominated cash inflows and outflows 
british pound denominated cash inflows generally exceed outflows  and the excess balance  if nominal  is maintained in a british pound denominated bank account 
substantial amounts of foreign currency are otherwise immediately converted to us dollars when received
