 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in performing this analysis  the fair value of the reporting unit was based on estimated proceeds from a potential sale and the implied fair value of goodwill was estimated by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value

during  the company experienced significantly higher costs for plastic raw materials  causing the reduction in gross profit percentage 
this decline in gross profit margin affected the company s three manufacturing segments  as margins in the distribution segment were essentially unchanged between years 
for the year ended december   plastic raw material costs were approximately percent higher on average compared to the prior year 
the company was able to recover a significant portion of the increased raw material costs through higher selling prices  cost control initiatives and improved manufacturing efficiencies  however  these measures could not offset the total impact of higher raw material costs on gross margins

depreciation and other non cash expenses were million in the current year compared with million in but cash provided by working capital was million in compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by working capital resulted from initiatives which successfully reduced accounts receivable and inventories by million and million  respectively

capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million and are expected to be in the range of million for each of the next years 
cash flows from operations and funds available under the credit agreement will provide the company s primary sources of future financing 
management believes that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet expected business requirements including capital expenditures  dividends  working capital and debt service 

table of contents the following summarizes the company s estimated future cash outflows from financial contracts and commitments less than year years years thereafter total dollars in thousands principal payments on debt interest lease payments pension and other retirement payments total market risk and derivative financial instruments the company has financing arrangements that require interest payments based on floating interest rates 
as such  the company s financial results are subject to changes in the market rate of interest 
our objective in managing the exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the volatility and impact of rate changes on earnings while maintaining the lowest overall borrowing cost 
at present  the company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on any portion of its financing arrangements with floating rates 
accordingly  based on current debt levels at december   if market interest rates increase one percent  the company s interest expense would increase approximately  some of the company s subsidiaries operate in foreign countries and  as such  their financial results are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements 
the company believes that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations do not represent a significant market risk due to the nature of the foreign countries in which we operate  primarily canada  as well as the size of those operations relative to the total company 
the company uses certain commodities  primarily plastic resins  in its manufacturing processes 
as such  the cost of operations is subject to fluctuation as the market for these commodities changes 
the company monitors this risk but currently has no derivative contracts to hedge this risk  however  the company also has no significant purchase obligations to purchase fixed quantities of such commodities in future periods 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in the summary of significant accounting policies included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported are affected by estimates and judgements that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
while estimates and judgements are applied in arriving at reported amounts  we believe the following matters may involve a high degree of judgement and complexity 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns  at the point of passage of title  which is at the time of shipment 
bad debts the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
additionally  the company also reviews historical trends for collectability in determining an estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by a material amount 

table of contents inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for approximately percent of the company s inventories and the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  recorded goodwill is subjected to annual impairment testing  unless significant changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may have occurred sooner 
goodwill impairment testing requires  in part  that we estimate the fair value of our business units which  in turn  requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates for those businesses 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment the company uses a combination of valuation techniques primarily using discounted cash flows to determine the fair values of its business reporting units and market based multiples as supporting evidence 
the variables and assumptions used  including the projections of future revenues and expenses  working capital  terminal values  discount rates and the market multiples observed in sale transactions are determined separately for each reporting unit 
the underlying assumptions used are based on historical actual experience and future expectations that are consistent with those used in the company s strategic plan 
in addition we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in determining market multiples in valuing our business units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate values for each of our business units 
our estimate of the fair values of these business units and the related goodwill  could change over time based on a variety of factors  including the actual operating performance of the underlying business or the impact of future events on the cost of capital and the related discount rates used 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

sfas no 
requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency were settled for an amount greater than our estimates  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency were settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest such earnings for an indefinite period of time 
the company has operations outside the united states and in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates both higher and lower than in the united states 
as a result  tax and treasury planning and analysis of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amounts of tax assets  liabilities and expense to be recognized 
recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation provides accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return as well as additional disclosures related to these tax positions 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently assessing the effect of fin no 
on its consolidated financial statements  however  we do not expect adoption of the new standard to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  rather it applies under existing accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  myers industries inc is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of sfas no 
on the consolidated financial statements
