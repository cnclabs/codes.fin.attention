item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an emerging pharmaceutical company with substantial expertise and intellectual property in nitric oxide based drug development 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts towards the research and development of our product candidates and the commercialization of our currently marketed product  bidil 
since our inception  we have mainly funded our operations through the sale of equity securities  debt financings  license fees  research and development funding  milestone payments from our collaborative partners  and more recently  sales of bidil 
we have never been profitable and have incurred an accumulated deficit of million as of december  in june  the fda approved our product  bidil  for the treatment of heart failure in self identified black patients as an adjunct to current standard therapies 
bidil is an orally administered fixed dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride 
we commercially launched bidil in july we engaged schwarz pharma under a five year exclusive manufacturing and supply agreement exclusively for the three times daily immediate release dosage formulation of bidil 
in march  we eliminated our discovery research program and terminated substantially all of the employees in our discovery research group in a restructuring of our company that was intended to better align costs with revenue and operating expectations 
in connection with our restructuring in march  we terminated substantially all of the employees in our discovery research group and determined to limit our future internal development activities to the continued development of bidil xr  as well as efforts to out license our nitric oxide enhancing technology in exchange for potential milestone payments and royalties on sales 
in october  we implemented a revised strategy and business model in order to focus our resources on the development of bidil xr as expeditiously as possible 
as part of this strategic shift  we eliminated our current sales force and replaced it with a small team of highly experienced senior cardiovascular specialists  resulting in a net reduction of approximately in sales force headcount 
in addition  we also eliminated approximately of our general and administrative personnel in connection with this restructuring program 
our restructured sales force will be comprised of a director of managed markets  six national account directors  two area business directors and twenty one cardiovascular business managers 
our sales and marketing organization will continue to be managed by our senior vice president of commercial operations 
this highly specialized team is currently being assembled and will focus on regional and national thought leader physicians  current bidil prescribers  as well as key institutions in major metropolitan centers that treat  and influence the treatment of  large numbers of african americans diagnosed with heart failure 
additional marketing methods will be utilized to reach the broader number of existing and potential bidil prescribers 
we expect that this alternative strategy will employ a less costly approach to marketing the current immediate release formulation of bidil during bidil xr s planned development 
we believe this revised strategy will allow us to conserve the cash required to accelerate development efforts with respect to bidil xr while refocusing the market presence of the current bidil formulation 
preclinical studies with bidil xr have been positive  and we commenced early stage clinical development of bidil xr in october our current plan for seeking regulatory approval for bidil xr  that will include conducting of bioequivalence studies  if successful and accepted as part of the basis for approval  is expected to enable us to achieve an accelerated development timeline 
we expect to provide further updates on the clinical timeline and regulatory pathway for bidil xr after preliminary clinical data have been assessed 
in connection with our efforts to develop bidil xr  in february  we entered into a license with elan  pursuant to which elan granted to us an exclusive worldwide royalty bearing license  with specified sublicense rights  to specified intellectual property of elan  as well as any improvements to any of the foregoing developed by either party during the term of the agreement 
pursuant to the license  we may import  use  offer for sale and sell an oral capsule formulation incorporating specified technology owned or controlled by elan and containing  as its sole active combination of ingredients  the combination of the active drug substances isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride 
in consideration for the grant of the license  we have agreed to pay elan royalties that are calculated by reference to annual net sales parameters set forth in the agreement 
in addition  we have also agreed to pay elan specified amounts upon the achievement of specified development and commercialization milestone events set forth in the agreement 
in the near term  a key driver of our success will be our ability to successfully commercialize and sustain market penetration of bidil with our restructured and smaller specialty sales force and to accelerate the development of  and obtain regulatory approval for  the commercial sale of bidil xr 
since we commercially launched bidil in july  we have generated approximately million in product sales  including product sales of million in we will need to generate significant revenues from sales of bidil and  if approved  bidil xr  to achieve profitability 
at the present time  we are unable to estimate the level of revenues that we will realize from the sales of bidil or  if approved  bidil xr 
we are therefore unable to estimate when we will achieve profitability  if at all 
we have also applied our nitric oxide technology to develop novel pharmaceuticals  as well as safer and more effective versions of existing drugs  and to target significant diseases that are characterized by a deficiency in nitric oxide 
as a result of our restructurings in march and october  we expect that research  development and commercialization expenses will decline in  due primarily to a decrease in headcount and research and commercialization activities  partially offset by an increase in ongoing development expenses for bidil xr 
we estimate that our operating expenses related to research and development and sales  general and administrative functions for the year ended december  will be approximately million  excluding cost of product sales and including stock based compensation related to statement of financial accounting standards no 
r 
we estimate that our operating expenses will be reduced on an annualized basis by approximately million as a result of our march and october restructurings 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to fund our current business plan for at least the next twelve months 
financial operations overview revenue 
our first commercial product  bidil  was launched in july  and generated product sales of million for the year ended december  prior to the launch of bidil  all of our revenue had been derived from license fees  research and development payments and milestone payments that we received from our corporate collaborators 
in future years  we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales  license fees  and milestone and royalty payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships  as well as royalties resulting from the license of our intellectual property 
we expect that any collaborative revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of research and development  milestone and other payments received under our collaborative or strategic relationships and related continuing obligations  as well as the timing and amount of revenue we recognize for the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  costs of contract research and manufacturing  costs of facilities and bidil medical support costs 
the following summarizes our primary research and development programs 
we have not provided program costs because prior to we did not track and accumulate cost information by research program 
bidil 
from may to july  we enrolled  patients at clinical sites in the united states in our phase iii clinical trial for bidil 
we halted the trial in july due to a significant survival benefit in the preliminary data for patients taking bidil 
the fda approved bidil on june   and we launched bidil in july the total cost for the bidil a heft trial was approximately million 
bidil xr 
the current formulation of bidil is an immediate release tablet that must be taken three times daily 
we are currently pursuing the development of bidil xr  an extended release formulation of bidil  that could be taken once a day 
to date  we have incurred approximately million in connection with the development of bidil xr 
preclinical studies with bidil xr have been positive  and we have commenced clinical development of bidil xr 
because of its stage of development  and the uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical development generally  we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize bidil xr 
moreover  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material cash inflows are expected to commence  if at all  for bidil xr 
nitric oxide enhancing cardiovascular compounds 
we have utilized our nitric oxide expertise and proprietary position to develop a proprietary nitric oxide enhancing cardio renal compound  referred to as nmi we have retained all commercial rights to this product candidate and are currently seeking out licensing and collaboration opportunities for this compound 
currently  we do not intend to incur additional internal research and development expenses related to nmi because this compound has not been developed beyond the pre clinical stage  the successful development of this product candidate is highly uncertain 
in addition  we cannot be certain if we will be able to secure an out licensing or collaboration partner for this compound on favorable terms  if at all 
as such  we are not able to estimate when material cash inflows from product sales  milestones and royalties could commence  if at all 
other discovery research 
we have used our know how and expertise in nitric oxide to develop drug candidates that are nitric oxide enhancing versions of existing medicines in the areas of cardiovascular  gastrointestinal anti inflammatory and pulmonary medicine 
these studies have not progressed beyond a discovery stage of testing  and it remains speculative whether the addition of nitric oxide will result in an improved clinical profile of these medicines 
we are currently seeking out licensing and collaboration opportunities for these product candidates  and are not presently engaging in any internal research and development activities with respect to these drugs 
we cannot be certain if we will be able to secure out licensing or collaboration partners for these product candidates on favorable terms  if at all 
as such  we are not able to estimate when material cash inflows from product sales  milestones and royalties could commence  if ever 
nitric oxide stents 
we formerly had a research program with boston scientific corporation  or boston scientific  to develop cardiovascular stents enhanced with a bio compatible polymer that is capable of releasing nitric oxide 
in accordance with the terms of our agreement with boston scientific  the research term expired in december the research program under this agreement focused on pre clinical development 
we intend to seek out licensing and collaboration opportunities for these product candidates  subject to the terms of our agreement with boston scientific and pending resolution of the ongoing rights of the parties with respect to this technology 
we cannot be certain if we will be able to secure out licensing or collaboration partners for these product candidates on favorable terms  if at all 
significant additional expenditures will be required to conduct pre clinical testing and to apply for  and conduct  clinical trials 
we are not presently engaging in any internal research and development activities with respect to cardiovascular stents 
because this program has not progressed beyond a pre clinical stage of development  the successful development of products based upon this program is highly uncertain 
as such  we are unable to estimate when material cash inflows from milestones and royalties could commence  if at all 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and adminstrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in sales and marketing  executive  finance  investor relations  accounting  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  costs for public relations  advertising and promotion services  professional fees for legal and accounting services  and costs related to our former contract sales agreement with publicis selling solutions  inc  or publicis 
non operating income 
non operating income includes interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and interest expense associated with our long term debt 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in product sales for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in we commercially launched bidil in july there were no product sales for the year ended december  research and development revenues were for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for the million  or decrease in research and development revenues in compared to was due to the termination of the research term under our collaboration agreement with boston scientific in december for the year ended december   research and development revenues totaled million  a or million decrease in revenue compared to the decrease in research revenue in was due to the termination of an agreement with merck in november in we recognized million in revenue under this agreement  which included all amounts previously deferred 
due to the termination of this collaboration agreement  we no longer have any future performance obligations  and accordingly  we recognized previously deferred license revenue of million 
in addition  we recognized million that was originally scheduled to be paid to us during for research and development funding  but was instead paid to us in when the agreement was terminated 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales decreased to million in from million in the million  or decrease in cost of product sales in compared to is primarily due to a million decrease in inventory impairment charges from million in to million in included in cost of product sales are charges for contractual purchase commitments in the amounts of million in and million in the charges were due to our current estimate of inventory requirements based on our sales forecast 
offsetting the decrease in inventory impairment charges were higher product costs and higher royalty costs due to increased sales 
research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in the million  or decrease in research and development expenses in compared with was primarily the result of decreased clinical and medical expenses needed to support the commercial launch of bidil  a decrease in payroll and benefits due to our restructuring in march  and decreases in the areas of continuing medical education  clinical advisory boards  medical services fees  publications and other various contracted services totaling million 
these decreases were offset by increases in the amount of million for stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  in january the million  or increase in research and development expenses in compared with was primarily the result of increased clinical and medical expenses to support the commercial launch of bidil in the areas of continuing medical education  clinical advisory boards  medical services fees  publications and other various contracted services totaling million 
we also incurred increased research and development expenses in of million related to product development projects 
offsetting the increased medical support and research expenses in was a decrease of million in clinical trial expenses as a result of the completion of the a heft trial in  a decrease in drug manufacturing expense of million and a decrease in compensation expense of million 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expense for our principal research and development programs for the fiscal years ended december   and december  research and development program bidil bidil xr nitric oxide enhancing cardiovascular compounds nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors nitric oxide stents other total research and development expense sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in the million  or decrease in sales  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to a decrease of million related to the termination our sales force and million for advertising and promotional services and public relations 
these decreases are offset by increases in the amount of million for stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r in january sales  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the million  or increase in sales  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to an increase of million for the implementation of our contract sales force under our agreement with publicis  million for the hiring of sales and marketing management personnel  and million for advertising and promotional services and public relations 
we also incurred higher general and administrative expense in due to increased costs of million associated with the accrual of business development expenses pertaining to the approval process for bidil  million pertaining to additional legal and consulting expenses and million related to the hiring of executive management and additional administrative personnel 
restructurings 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to a restructuring of our discovery research operations that was intended to better align costs with revenue and operating expectations 
the restructuring charges pertained to employee severance and impairment of assets and were recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas in connection with the restructuring plan  we terminated employees in our discovery research group  or approximately of our workforce  resulting in a charge of million 
none of these employees remained employed as of march  as a result of terminating these employees  we recorded an impairment charge for certain research laboratory equipment  computer equipment  and furniture and fixtures aggregating  for which the future use was uncertain 
these assets were written down to their fair value utilizing a third party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the assets based on current market quotes and the current condition of the equipment  furniture and fixtures 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million comprised of severance benefits of million and impairment charges of million for certain research and development equipment  leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and computers 
the restructuring charges were recorded in accordance with sfas and sfas this restructuring program included the elimination of sales personnel and general and administrative and research and development personnel 
these employees were terminated in october  and no employee remained employed at december  due to these actions  certain research and development equipment  leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and computers became impaired 
these assets were written down to the fair value based on either a third party quote  or the estimated discounted cash flows they will generate over the remaining economic life 
stock based compensation expense 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective application method 
compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of the options as calculated by the black scholes valuation model and is recognized ratably over the employee s service period 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb under apb  we generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas r under the modified prospective application method allowed us to recognize compensation cost beginning with the effective date of january  based on a the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
under the modified prospective application method  prior periods are not restated for the effect of sfas r 
as a result of adopting sfas r on january   our net loss and net loss per share were million and  respectively  higher than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb as of december   the total compensation cost related to unvested awards to employees not yet recognized in the statement of operations was approximately million  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
non operating income 
non operating income decreased to million in compared to million in and million in the million  or decrease in non operating income in compared to was primarily related to million in higher interest expense associated with our debt  which was outstanding all of compared to six months in  offset by million in higher interest income 
the million  or increase in non operating income in compared to was primarily related to higher interest income due to higher average investment balances and higher interest rates in  offset by interest expense related to long term debt 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have primarily funded our operations through the sale of equity securities  debt financings  license fees  research and development funding  milestone payments from our collaborative partners and  more recently  sales of bidil 
as of december   we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of equity securities  primarily as the result of the sale of million of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in november  net proceeds of million from our follow on public offering in december  and net proceeds of million from our registered direct offering in january at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
on june   we borrowed i million from oxford finance corporation  or oxford  and ii million from general electric capital corporation  or gecc  pursuant to the terms of promissory notes made by us with both oxford and gecc  respectively 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum and are payable in consecutive monthly installments of principal and accrued interest  beginning july  the notes are secured by a security interest in all our personal property and fixtures with the exception of any intellectual property or products acquired  whether by purchase  license or otherwise  on or after the execution of the notes 
the agreements that we entered into with each of oxford and gecc in connection with the notes also contain a material adverse change clause with both oxford and gecc 
under this clause  if oxford or gecc reasonably determine that our ability to repay the notes has been materially impaired  we would be considered in default 
as of december   we were in compliance with this clause 
as of december   we had paid aggregate principal in the amount of million 
during the year ended december   operating activities used cash of million primarily due to a net loss of million  the use of million in cash for accounts payable  and million for accrued expenses  offset by decreases in accounts receivable of million  and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
these cash flow decreases are offset by adjustments for non cash impairment charges for restructuring of million  stock based compensation expense of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
during the year ended december   investing activities provided cash of million primarily due to the net sales of marketable securities of million  offset by million in fixed asset purchases 
we expect to invest  to  for capital expenditures in  principally related to the leasehold improvements  and computer equipment to support the current headcount 
during the year ended december   financing activities provided cash of million due to proceeds of million from our registered direct offering  and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans  offset by million in principal payments on long term debt 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than five years operating lease obligation long term debt purchase obligations license milestones total contractual cash obligations the amounts reflect obligations related to i our lease for  square feet of laboratory and office space at spring street in lexington  massachusetts and ii our lease for  square feet at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts 
we entered into the lease for the spring street premises on january   and the lease is for a term of ten years with options that permit renewals for additional five year periods 
the expected minimum rental commitments under the spring street lease are     and  for each year in the five calendar year period ending december   respectively  and million in total for the remainder of the lease term 
we are in the process of negotiating the assignment of this lease 
we entered into the lease for the hayden avenue premises on february  the term of the hayden avenue lease is for sixty six months beginning on the commencement date  which is defined in the lease as the earlier of a the day immediately following the substantial completion of certain improvements to the premises as set forth in the lease or b the first day on which we occupy all or any portion of the premises for the conduct of our business 
the expected minimum rental commitments under the hayden avenue lease are     and  for each year in the five calendar year period ending december   respectively  and  in total for the remainder of the lease term 
other purchase obligations are million in purchase commitments to schwarz pharma for manufacture of finished goods in the first quarter of on february   nitromed entered into a license agreement with elan  pursuant to which nitromed may be obligated to pay certain milestone payments in the aggregate amount of  of which  was paid in the first quarter of we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to fund our current business plan for at least the next months 
we will require additional funding in the future and may seek to do so through collaborative co promotion arrangements and or public or private financings 
however  additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail certain of our sales and marketing efforts  and our development efforts with respect to bidil xr  and we may be required to limit  scale back or cease our operations 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products 
even if we are able to raise additional funds in a timely manner  our future capital requirements may vary from what we expect and will depend on many factors  including the following the magnitude of product sales of bidil  the successful commercialization of bidil  the cost of manufacturing  marketing and selling bidil  the timing of when we receive significant revenue from bidil  if at all  the time and costs involved in completing the clinical trials and further development of  and obtaining regulatory approvals for  bidil xr  if at all  our ability to establish and maintain co promotion  out licensing and collaborative arrangements  the timing  receipt and amount of royalties  milestone and other payments  if any  from potential collaborators  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  and the cost of obtaining and maintaining licenses to use patented technologies 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  accounts receivable  inventory  accrued expenses and the factors used to determine the fair value of our stock options 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
our principal source of revenue is the sale of bidil  which began shipping in july of other sources of revenue to date include license fees  research and development payments and milestone payments that we have received from our corporate collaborators 
product sales deferred revenue 
we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and recognize revenue from product sales upon delivery of product to wholesalers or pharmacies  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the wholesaler and collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for sales returns  wholesaler allowances  rebates  and discounts 
for arrangements where the risk of loss has not passed to wholesalers or pharmacies  we defer the recognition of revenue by recording deferred revenue until such time that risk of loss has passed 
in addition  we evaluate our level of shipments to wholesalers and pharmacies on a quarterly basis compared to the estimated level of inventory in the channel  remaining shelf life of the product shipped and quarterly forecasted sales 
as a result of this evaluation  we deferred million of revenue from the december shipments and recorded this amount in deferred revenue as of december  during  we reversed million of this deferred revenue and recognized the remainder as revenue 
sales returns  allowances  rebates and discounts 
our product sales are subject to returns  wholesaler allowances  rebates and cash and contract discounts that are customary in the pharmaceutical industry 
a large portion of our product sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution through pharmacies to patients  who are consumers of the product 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for sales returns  wholesaler allowances  rebates and discounts 
we determine our provisions for sales returns  allowances  rebates and discounts based primarily on estimates and contractual terms 
in developing a reasonable estimate for the reserve for product returns  we considered the factors in paragraph of sfas  revenue recognition when a right of return exists 
although we have not yet developed a significant history of product returns because of the recent launch of bidil  we believe we have developed a reasonable estimate of returns based on actual returns data compared to product shipped 
we will continue to monitor actual returns as we gain more sales experience with bidil 
product returns 
consistent with industry practice  we offer contractual return rights that allow customers to return product only during the period that is six months prior to  and twelve months after product expiration 
commercial product shipped during had a shelf life of twelve months from date of manufacture with expiration dates ranging from april to november during the third quarter of  we began shipping commercial product with an expiration date of months 
factors that are considered in our estimate of future product returns include an analysis of the amount of product in the wholesaler and pharmacy channels  discussions with key wholesalers and other customers regarding inventory levels and shipment trends  review of consumer consumption data as reported by source projected launchtrac provided by wolters kluwer health  and  the remaining time to expiration of our product 
as a result of this ongoing evaluation  our product return reserve was million at december  and million at december  this reserve is evaluated on a quarterly basis  assessing each of the factors described above  and adjusted accordingly 
based on the factors noted above  we believe our estimate of product returns is reasonable  and changes  if any  from this estimate would not have a material impact to our financial statements 
initial trade shipments incentive 
during july of  we offered certain product stocking incentives to a number of wholesalers and pharmacy customers 
these incentives included units with guaranteed sales provisions and extended payment terms 
as a result of these provisions  we concluded that these sales were essentially consignment sales as the risk of loss of these units had not passed to the customer 
accordingly  we have deferred all revenue related to these units until such time as the unit is provided to a patient with a prescription 
at december   the remaining balance of deferred revenue related to these units was million 
through december   we had either recognized the revenue related to these units  or the product had been returned or estimated to be returned 
cash incentives 
during the third quarter of  we offered certain additional incentives to a number of pharmacy customers 
these cash incentives included placement and advertising assistance in the amount of  we recorded this amount as a reduction to revenue during the year ended december  no cash incentives were offered during the twelve month period ended december  sample voucher and co pay card program 
beginning in the third quarter of  we initiated a sample voucher program whereby we offered an incentive to patients in the form of a free day trial or approximately tablets  of bidil 
we have accounted for this program in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  or eitf no 
these sample programs have historically had quarterly expiration dates such that each sample voucher program is only active for one quarter at a time 
as a result  at the end of each quarter we can determine the actual amount of reimbursement claims received for the vouchers distributed during the quarter 
the amount of reimbursement is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
during the third quarter  we initiated a six month co pay program 
as a result of these programs  we recorded a reduction to revenue of million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to offer co pay incentives in future periods 
sales discounts  rebates and allowances 
sales discounts  rebates and allowances result primarily from sales under contract with healthcare providers  wholesalers  medicare and medicaid programs and other governmental agencies 
we estimate rebates and contractual allowances  cash and contract discounts and other rebates by considering the following factors current contract prices and terms  sales volume  estimated customer and wholesaler inventory levels and current average rebate rates 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded cash discounts  rebates and other allowances of million and million  respectively 
collaboration revenue 
we record collaboration revenue on an accrual basis as it is earned and when amounts are considered collectible 
revenues received in advance of performance obligations or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services  are deferred and recognized over the contractual or estimated performance period 
revenues from milestone payments that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process are recorded when the milestone is achieved 
contract revenues are recorded as the services are performed 
when we are required to defer revenue  the period over which such revenue should be recognized is subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the collaborative agreement 
we had no collaboration revenue during the year ended december  accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consists of amounts due from wholesalers and pharmacies for the purchase of bidil 
ongoing evaluations of customers credit worthiness are performed and collateral is generally not required 
as of december   we have not reserved any amount for bad debts related to the sale of bidil 
we continuously review all customer accounts to determine if an allowance for uncollectible accounts is necessary 
we currently provide substantially all of our customers with payment terms of net days 
amounts past due from customers are determined based on contractual payment terms 
through december   payments have generally been made in a timely manner 
inventories 
we review our estimates of the net realizable value of our inventories at each reporting period 
our estimate of the net realizable value of our inventories is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value of our inventories could vary significantly from our estimates and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations in any reporting period 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our current inventory levels and future irrevocable inventory purchase commitments and write down inventory that has become un saleable  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and irrevocable inventory purchase commitments that are in excess of expected future inventory requirements based on our sales forecasts 
for the year ended december   we recorded an inventory impairment charge of million to cost of sales related to commercial trade and patient sample inventory  and a million charge to cost of sales for contractual purchase commitments 
for the year ended december   we recorded an inventory impairment charge of million to cost of sales related to commercial trade and patient sample inventory  and a million charge to cost of sales for contractual purchase commitments 
during the first quarter of  bidil s shelf life for newly produced finished goods was extended to months 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers for the production of finished goods  marketing and medical support fees  such as advisory boards  and publications  marketing service fees and professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs  which have begun to be incurred  or we over or under estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r to recognize compensation cost associated with stock option issued to employees 
determining the amount of stock based compensation expense to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of a stock option 
the fair value of each stock award is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make estimates for volatility  risk free interest rate  expected term  and expected dividend yield 
volatility is determined exclusively using historical volatility data of our common stock based on the period of time since our common stock has been publicly traded 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected life assumption 
the expected life of stock options granted is based exclusively on historical data and represents the weighted average period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected life is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole  as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior amongst its employee population 
accounting for equity instruments granted or sold by us under apb  sfas and eitf requires fair value estimates of the equity instrument granted or sold 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  our expenses may be over or under stated 
for equity instruments granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services  we estimate the fair value of the equity instruments based upon consideration of factors which we deem to be relevant at that time 
because shares of our common stock were not publicly traded prior to the commencement of our public offering on november   market factors historically considered in valuing stock and stock option grants include comparative values of public companies discounted for the risk and limited liquidity provided for in the shares we are issuing  pricing of private sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  prior valuations of stock grants and the effect of events that have occurred between the time of such grants  economic trends  and the comparative rights and preferences of the security being granted compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity 
prior to our initial public offering  the fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors contemporaneously with the grant 
in the absence of a public trading market for our common stock  our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors in determining the fair value of our common stock 
at the time of option grants and other stock issuances  our board of directors considered the liquidation preferences  dividend rights  voting control and anti dilution protection attributable to our then outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock  the status of private and public financial markets  valuations of comparable private and public companies  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering  our existing financial resources  our anticipated continuing operating losses and increased spending levels required to complete our clinical trials  dilution to common stockholders from anticipated future financings and a general assessment of future business risks 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin this interpretation requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  beginning with our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we do not believe the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab sab provides interpretive guidance on the sec s views regarding the process of quantifying materiality of financial statement misstatements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  beginning with our fiscal year 
the adoption of sab did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those years 
we do not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market and high grade corporate and us government related securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of two years or less 
in addition  we hold auction rate securities that reset monthly  however the maturities of securities at december  range from to our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december  or december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments
