item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview our business is concentrated in areas of the soft floorcovering market where innovative styling  design  color  quality and service as well as limited distribution are welcomed and rewarded 
through our fabrica  masland residential  masland contract and dixie home brands  we have a significant presence in the high end of the soft floorcovering market 
we utilize a small amount of our manufacturing capacity to process plied and heat set filament yarns and provide carpet dyeing and finishing services for independent carpet manufacturers 
during the five year period ending december   our carpet sales grew at a compounded annual growth rate of in dollars and in units  significantly faster than the sales of the carpet industry 
during this five year period the compounded annual growth rate of carpet sales for the industry was in dollars and its units sold declined by 
we believe our focus on high end markets  which appear to be growing faster than the overall carpet industry  and our dedication to the development of new and differentiated products are responsible for much of our revenue growth 
the rapid growth of our carpet business increased the complexity of our operations  significantly overtaxed our manufacturing  distribution and operating capabilities and created a number of issues all of which increased cost  particularly in the second half of and the first half of we addressed these issues by adding facilities and making a number of changes in our existing facilities and management to simplify our operations and reduce cost in the future 
we began seeing the benefits of these changes in the third and fourth quarters of critical accounting policies certain estimates and assumptions are made when preparing our financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including amounts reported for assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  and amounts reported for revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods presented 
estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from estimates made in preparing the financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance requiring management to identify its most critical accounting policies as defined by such guidance 
such critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and the application of which requires our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
although estimates have not been materially different from actual experience  our estimates pertain to inherently uncertain matters that could result in material differences in subsequent periods 
we believe application of the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and represent our critical accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies are discussed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues  including shipping and handling amounts  are recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership  which is generally on the date of shipment 
at the time revenue is recognized  we record a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions that exist at the time revenue is recognized 
page accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and periodic evaluation of the financial condition of our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers significantly deteriorates  or other factors impair their ability to pay their debts  credit losses could differ from allowances recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
customer claims and product warranties 
we provide varying warranties related to our products against manufacturing defects and specific performance standards 
we record reserves for the estimated costs of defective products and failure to meet applicable performance standards 
the levels of reserves are established based primarily upon historical experience and our evaluation of known claims 
because our evaluations are primarily based on historical experience  actual results could differ from the reserves used in our consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo  which generally matches current costs of inventory sold with current revenues  for substantially all inventories 
reserves are also established to adjust inventories that are off quality  aged or obsolete to their estimated fair market value 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
additionally  rates of recoverability per unit of off quality  obsolete or excessive inventory are estimated based on historical rates of recoverability and other known conditions or circumstances that may affect future recoverability 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value our inventory 
goodwill 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the underlying assets and businesses to which the goodwill applies based on estimates of future cash flows  which require judgments and assumptions about future economic factors that are difficult to predict and in some cases beyond our control 
changes in our judgments and assumptions about future economic factors could materially change our estimate of values and could materially impact the value of goodwill and our consolidated financial statements 
self insured accruals 
we estimate the costs to settle claims related to our self insured medical  dental and workers compensation plans 
these estimates include costs to settle known claims  as well as incurred and unreported claims 
the estimated costs of known and unreported claims are based on historical experience 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to estimate these accruals 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates that will be applicable in future periods when the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the change in income tax rates is enacted 
taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of various items in a manner that could affect the tax treatment of such items going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using existing laws  rules and regulations  each of which is subject to chang e 
share based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments effective january  prior to january   we accounted for share based payments using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 as permitted by sfas no 
 and accordingly  did not record compensation expense for stock options 
we did not modify existing stock based awards prior to adoption of the new accounting statement and used the modified prospective method to account for compensation expense for share based payments for periods after the date of adoption for a all unvested stock based awards granted prior to january   based on the estimated grant date fair value in accordance with previous guidance  and b all awards granted after january   based on the estimated grant date fair value in accordance with the new provisions 
all stock based awards granted prior to adoption of the new standard  and some of the awards granted after the adoption of the new standard  were not subject to a market condition 
accordingly  we used the black scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of these awards  both prior to and after adoption of the new page statement 
the grant date fair value of awards granted after the adoption of the new standard that are subject to a market condition were determined using a binomial model 
because we used the modified prospective method to adopt the new standard and the estimated forfeiture method was used under sfas no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  there was no cumulative effect on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
at december   unvested stock options and shares of restricted stock awards are expected to vest over the next six and one half years 
the compensation expense associated with these awards was thousand in on march   restricted stock with a grant date fair value of approximately million that will vest over the next years to years was awarded under our stock incentive plan 
the compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock  including the awards granted in  is expected to be million in  thousand in  thousand in and million thereafter 
no stock options were granted in and we do not expect to grant any stock options in results of operations our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with u

generally accepted accounting principles 
the following table sets forth certain elements of our continuing operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses other operating income other operating expense operating income fiscal year ended december  weeks  compared with fiscal year ended december  weeks net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million 
net sales of our carpet products increased and net sales related to our carpet yarn and carpet dyeing and finishing services decreased 
compared with  net sales of residential carpet increased and net sales of commercial carpet increased 
our net sales were negatively affected by significant weakness in the carpet industry during the third and fourth quarters of the year and one less operating week in  compared with adjusting for the extra operating week in  our net sales of carpet products rose in dollars and in units in  compared to the previous year 
our carpet sales continued to outpace the carpet industry  where sales of carpet declined in dollars and in units  compared with the prior year 
we believe the improvement in our net sales is principally attributable to our focus on high end markets and the new and differentiated products we have developed over the past several years 
our ancillary sales of carpet yarn and carpet dyeing and finishing services are not significant to our core business and their decrease had less than a effect on our total net sales 
cost of sales 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in  compared with  was principally attributable to costs related to start up a new tufting and modular carpet tile operations  higher levels of off quality production and settlement expenses related to the termination of a legacy defined benefit retirement plan during the first half of the year 
a significant portion of the quality issues were related to outsourcing of tufting production prior to june when our new tufting facility began operating on a full schedule 
the year over year comparison was also affected by lifo inventory liquidations that reduced cost of sales by thousand in and thousand in page gross profit 
the percentage point decline in gross profit was attributable to the cost increases described above 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were down thousand in  compared with  due to tight control of discretionary spending 
the decrease of these expenses as a percentage of net sales to in  compared with in  reflects the effect of lower levels of spending and higher net sales in other operating income 
other operating income increased thousand in due to insurance settlements and refunds that more than offset lower gains from the sale of operating assets 
other operating expense 
other operating expense increased thousand in primarily as a result of losses recognized from the impairment of certain operating assets 
operating income 
operating income was million  or of sales in  compared with million  or of sales in interest expense 
interest expense increased million in primarily as a result of higher levels of debt

other income decreased thousand in principally as a result of a gain on the sale of real estate in that did not repeat in other expense 
other expense was not significant in or income tax provision 
our effective income tax rate was in  compared with in the change in the effective tax rates is principally due to reductions in our tax contingency reserve due to favorable resolution of federal and state tax examinations and expirations of tax statute of limitations 
we also were able to utilize more state and federal income tax credits in net income 
income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share in  compared with million  or per diluted share in results related to discontinued operations reflected a loss of million  or per diluted share in  compared to income of thousand  or per diluted share  in the loss from discontinued operations in was principally the result of the termination of a legacy defined benefit pension plan that had been frozen as to new benefits since including discontinued operations  net income was million  or per diluted share in  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year ended december  weeks  compared with fiscal year ended december  weeks net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million

net sales in were positively affected by one more operating week than in the year 
adjusting for the extra operating week in  net sales of carpet products rose  in  compared with the previous year 
over half of the total improvement in net sales was attributable to the dixie home collection of residential products 
a significant portion of the growth in our carpet business resulted from increased selling prices enacted during in response to raw material and other cost increases 
the decrease in carpet yarn sa les is principally a result of carpet yarn sourcing arrangements in the prior year associated with the sale of our north georgia operations that did not continue into cost of sales 
cost of sales was of net sales in compared with in the increase in cost as a percentage of net sales in reflects the effect of our rapid growth  higher raw material  energy and other costs and weather related disruptions on our operations 
the rapid growth of our carpet business experienced in recent years increased the complexity of our operations  significantly overtaxed our manufacturing  distribution and operational capabilities  and had a negative impact on customer service  product quality and manufacturing efficiencies 
to improve service to our customers  we added associates  lengthened operating schedules  and increased production outsourcing all of which increased costs in to simplify our east coast manufacturing and distribution operations and consolidate our west coast operations  we added page staff and moved inventory to two new distribution centers and started a new tufting manufacturing operation 
while the cost to staff and build the infrastructure of these new facilities was incurred in  these actions should simplify our operations and reduce cost in the future 
lags in passing higher raw material and utility costs through to our customers also significantly impacted our costs in the year over year comparison was also affected by lifo inventory liquidations that reduced cost of sales by thousand  or one tenth of a percentage point in and million  or eight tenths of a percentage point in gross profit 
the percentage point decline in gross profit was attributable to the cost increases described above 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million in  but decreased as a percentage of net sales to in  compared with in the percentage decrease is primarily attributable to the higher sales volume 
other operating income

these funds were used to fund our operations  purchase million of property  plant and equipment  pay million of taxes related to the sale of a business and pay million of additional purchase price consideration related to a previous business acquisition 
during the three years ended december   accounts receivable increased million and inventories increased million to support our sales growth 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased during this period by million as a result of the sale of a significant portion of our business in late the accounts payables  accrued expenses and income taxes related to the assets sold were retained by the company and paid in page in june  we terminated a legacy defined benefit pension plan and distributed the plan s assets to participants 
approximately million of cash was used to fully fund the pension plan in order to complete the plan s termination and asset distribution 
capital expenditures were million in and depreciation and amortization was million 
capital expenditures in were primarily for equipment installed in our new tufting facility  new manufacturing technology in our other carpet operations and investments in information systems 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million to million in  and depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately million 
the capital expenditures will be primarily for newer manufacturing technology and to a lesser extent  information systems 
in  we amended our senior loan and security agreement to increase the revolving credit portion of the facility  change certain definitions in the agreement to facilitate the increase in revolving credit and reduce credit spreads applicable to borrowings under the agreement 
as amended  the senior loan and security agreement matures on may  and at december  provides us with million of credit  consisting of million of revolving credit and a million term loan facility 
the term loan is payable in monthly principal installments of thousand and is due may  interest rates available under the senior loan and security agreement may be selected from a number of options that effectively allow us to borrow at rates ranging from the lender s prime rate to the lender s prime rate plus for base rate loans  or at rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus for libor loans 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under this agreement was at december  and at december  commitment fees ranging from to per annum are payable on the average daily unused balance of the revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on borrowings under the senior loan and security agreement are fixed by an interest rate swap arrangement  that effectively fixes million of borrowings under the agreement at plus the applicable credit spreads 
the levels of our accounts receivable and inventory limit borrowing availability under the revolving cre dit facility 
the facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
the senior loan and security agreement generally permits dividends and repurchases of our common stock up to an aggregate annual amount of million and such distributions in excess of million annually as may be made under conditions specified in the agreement 
the agreement also contains covenants that could limit future acquisitions 
the unused borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility on february  was approximately million 
in  million of capital expenditures were financed by equipment financing notes 
our million of equipment financing notes have terms ranging from five to seven years  are secured by the specific equipment financed  bear interest ranging from to and are due in monthly installments of principal and interest of thousand through february and monthly installments of principal and interest ranging from thousand to thousand from march through february the notes do not have financial covenants

future income tax considerations 
we do not anticipate that cash outlays for income taxes will be materially different than our provision for income taxes during the next three fiscal years 
net operating loss and income tax credit carryforwards in the amount of approximately million are expected to be utilized in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands the company s earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to interest rates 
it is the company s policy to minimize its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates and manage interest rate risks inherent in funding the company with debt 
the company addresses this financial exposure through a risk management program that includes maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and the use of derivative financial instruments 
at december   the company had an interest rate swap agreement on its mortgage note payable with a notional amount equal to the outstanding balance of the mortgage note  at december  which expires in march of under the interest rate swap agreement  the company pays a fixed rate of of interest times the notional amount and receives in return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest page times the same notional amount 
the swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the mortgage note payable at 
on october   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  through may  under the interest rate swap agreement  the company pays a fixed rate of interest of times the notional amount and receives in return a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount
