item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
we attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary 
we cannot be sure that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect  and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
the following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments at december  on our expected long term indebtedness 
however  we cannot predict the libor or hibor rates that will be in effect in the future 
accordingly  the one month libor and hibor rates at december  of and  respectively are used for all calculations in the table below 
as of december  thereafter total in millions long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate swap information wynn las vegas as of december   we have one interest rate swap arrangement to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of million of borrowings under the current wynn las vegas  llc term loan facility  which bears interest at libor plus 
under this interest rate swap arrangement  we receive payments at a variable rate of libor and pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount which expires on december  although this interest rate swap is highly effective economically in fixing the interest rate on this borrowing under the new term loan facility at approximately  changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps for each reporting period are  and will continue to be  recorded as an increase decrease in swap fair value as the swap does not qualify for hedge accounting 
wynn macau as of december   we have two interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under wynn macau sa s million senior term loan facility

the term of both swap agreements is from november  through november  these interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective in fixing the interest rate on of the us dollar and of the hong kong dollar borrowings under the senior bank facility at approximately and  respectively 
however  changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period recorded are  and will continue to be  recognized as an increase decrease in swap fair value as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting

table of contents foreign currency risks the currency delineated in wynn macau s concession agreement with the government of macau is the macau pataca 
the macau pataca  which is not a freely convertible currency  is linked to the hong kong dollar  and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in macau 
the hong kong dollar is linked to the us dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years 
however  the exchange linkages of the hong kong dollar and the macau pataca  and the hong kong dollar and the us dollar  are subject to potential changes due to  among other things  changes in chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments 
if the hong kong dollar and the macau pataca are not linked to the us dollar in the future  severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies may result 
we also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level 
because many of wynn macau s payment and expenditure obligations are in macau patacas  in the event of unfavorable macau pataca or hong kong dollar rate changes  wynn macau s obligations  as denominated in us dollars  would increase 
in addition  because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that wynn macau operates in macau will be in hong kong dollars  we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the hong kong dollar and the us dollar 
also  if any of our macau related entities incur us dollar denominated debt  fluctuations in the exchange rates of the macau pataca or the hong kong dollar  in relation to the us dollar  could have adverse effects on wynn macau s ability to service its debt  its results of operations and its financial condition 
we have not yet determined whether we will engage in hedging activities to protect against foreign currency risk
