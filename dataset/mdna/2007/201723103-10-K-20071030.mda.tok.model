this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this annual report 
we manufacture  recycle  market and distribute steel and metal products through a network of over locations in the united states and internationally 
our segment reporting includes five reportable segments domestic mills  cmc zawiercie cmcz  domestic fabrication  recycling and marketing and distribution 
the domestic mills segment includes the company s domestic steel minimills including the scrap processing facilities which directly support these mills and the copper tube minimill 
the copper tube minimill is aggregated with the company s steel minimills because it has similar economic characteristics 
the cmcz minimill and related operations in poland have been presented as a separate segment because the economic characteristics of their markets and the regulatory environment in which they operate are different from the company s domestic minimills 
the domestic fabrication segment consists of the company s rebar and joist fabrication operations  fence post manufacturing plants  construction related and other products facilities 
the recycling segment consists of the cmc recycling division s scrap processing and sales operations primarily in texas  florida and the southern united states 
marketing and distribution includes both domestic and international operations for the sales  distribution and processing of both ferrous and nonferrous metals and other industrial products 
the segment s activities consist only of physical transactions and not speculation 
domestic mills operations we conduct our domestic mills operations through a network of steel mills  commonly referred to as minimills  that produce reinforcing bar  angles  flats  rounds  fence post sections and other shapes  scrap processing facilities that directly support these minimills  a copper tube minimill  and a railroad rail salvage company 
cmcz operations we conduct our cmcz operations through a rolling mill that produces primarily reinforcing bar and some merchant products  
table of contents a rolling mill that produces primarily wire rod  our scrap processing facilities that directly support the cmcz minimill  and steel fabrication plants primarily for reinforcing bar 
domestic fabrication operations we conduct our domestic fabrication operations through a network of steel fabrication and processing plants that bend  weld  cut  fabricate  distribute and place steel  primarily reinforcing bar and angles  warehouses that sell or rent products for the installation of concrete  plants that produce special sections for floors and support for ceilings and floors  plants that produce steel fence posts  and plants that treat steel with heat to strengthen and provide flexibility 
recycling operations we conduct our recycling operations through metal processing plants located in the states of texas  oklahoma  kansas  louisiana  arkansas  missouri  georgia  tennessee  florida  south carolina  and north carolina 
marketing and distribution operations we market and distribute steel  copper and aluminum coil  sheet and tubing  ores  metal concentrates  industrial minerals  ferroalloys and chemicals through our network of marketing and distribution offices  processing facilities and joint ventures around the world 
our customers use these products in a variety of industries 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following are important accounting policies  estimates and assumptions that you should understand as you review our financial statements 
we apply these accounting policies and make these estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our use of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions affects our results of operations and our reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
where we have used estimates or assumptions  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped or when they are received based on the terms of the sale 
when we estimate that a contract with one of our customers will result in a loss  we accrue the entire loss as soon as it is probable and estimable 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the estimable probable impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular quarter 

table of contents inventory cost we determine inventory cost for most domestic inventories by the last in  first out method  or lifo 
we estimate our interim lifo reserve by using quantities and costs at quarter end and recording the resulting lifo expense in its entirety 
we record all inventories at the lower of their cost or market value 
property  plant and equipment our domestic mills  cmcz  domestic fabrication and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
we evaluate the value of these assets and other long lived assets whenever a change in circumstances indicates that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
some of the estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce 
if these assets were for sale  our estimates of their values could be significantly different because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
also  we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on our estimate of the assets economically useful lives and are evaluated annually 
to the extent that an asset s actual life differs from our estimate  there could be an impact on depreciation expense or a gain loss on the disposal of the asset in a later period 
we expense major maintenance costs as incurred 
other accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations year ended august  in millions except share data net sales net earnings per diluted share ebitda international net sales as of total sales lifo effect on net earnings per diluted share excludes the net sales of a division classified as discontinued operations 
last in  first out inventory valuation method 
in the table above  we have included a financial statement measure that was not derived in accordance with gaap 
we use ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization as a non gaap performance measure 
in calculating ebitda  we exclude our largest recurring non cash charge  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal  state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions 
tax regulations in international operations add additional complexity 
also  we exclude interest cost in our calculation of ebitda 
the results are  therefore  without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed 
we use ebitda as one guideline to assess our unleveraged performance return on our investments 
ebitda is also the target benchmark for our long term cash incentive performance plan for management 
reconciliations to net earnings are provided below for the year ended august in millions net earnings interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda loss from discontinued operations ebitda from continuing operations ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
because we have borrowed money in order to partially finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenues 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
also  the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our operations 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is appropriate to consider both net earnings determined under gaap  as well as ebitda  to evaluate our 
table of contents performance 
also  we separately analyze any significant fluctuations in interest expense  depreciation and amortization and income taxes 
the following events and performances had a significant financial impact during our fiscal year ended august  as compared to our fiscal year or are significant for our future operations we reported our highest net sales ever for the fourth straight year and net earnings were within thousand of the prior record year 
we experienced favorable foreign exchange rates during as compared to which resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately 
increased margins and higher volumes helped cmcz achieve record adjusted operating profit  more than double the prior year 
marketing and distribution had a increase in sales and a increase in adjusted operating profit 
the recycling segment had another strong year with a increase in sales 
tighter margins on ferrous kept adjusted operating profit million below last year s record 
the fabrication segment had higher sales  but higher steel prices reduced adjusted operating profit by 
net sales at our domestic mills were flat as compared to prices were higher but  fewer tons were shipped 
four acquisitions with a total purchase price of million were made and the bouras acquisition established cmc as a manufacturer of steel deck 
expense of million and capital expenditures of million were incurred for the global implementation of sap 
land was purchased for the new arizona micro minimill and construction will start in cmcz shares representing of outstanding shares were purchased from the polish government 
cmc now owns of cmcz 
the company s stock repurchase program increased earnings per share over the prior year 
we recorded a million after tax lifo expense per diluted share compared to million lifo expense per diluted share in our overall effective tax rate decreased to as compared to in due to shifts in profitability among tax jurisdictions 
our global expansion continues with the announcement of the acquisition on september  of an electronic arc furnace based steel pipe manufacturer in sisak  croatia 
in  our sales reached all time record levels as a result of the combination of continued high selling prices and volume increases in most of our segments 
increased purchase prices squeezed margins in our domestic mills  domestic fabrication and recycling segments 
our segments managed the volatile prices and we achieved net earnings comparable to our record prior year 
the strong net earnings level was achieved as we incurred million in expense for the global deployment of sap  an investment for our future 
strong global expansion has helped  and the improved economic situation in central and western europe has helped our polish operations achieve record net earnings 
our net earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal made it the second best quarter ever 

table of contents segments unless otherwise indicated  all dollars below are before minority interests and income taxes 
financial results for our reportable segments are consistent with the basis and manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information for making operating decisions 
see note  business segments  to the consolidated financial statements 
we use adjusted operating profit loss to compare and evaluate the financial performance of our segments 
adjusted operating profit is the sum of our earnings before income taxes  minority interests and financing costs 
adjusted operating profit is equal to earnings before income taxes for our domestic mills and domestic fabrication segments because these segments require minimal outside financing 
the following table shows net sales and adjusted operating profit loss by business segment year ended august  in millions net sales domestic mills cmcz domestic fabrication recycling marketing and distribution corporate and eliminations discontinued operations adjusted operating profit loss domestic mills cmcz domestic fabrication recycling marketing and distribution corporate and eliminations discontinued operations dollars are before minority interests 
lifo impact on adjusted operating profit lifo is an inventory costing method that assumes the most recent inventory purchases or goods manufactured are sold first 
this results in current sales prices offset against current inventory costs 
in periods of rising prices it has the effect of eliminating inflationary profits from net income 
in periods of declining prices it has the effect of eliminating deflationary losses from net income 
in either case the goal is to reflect economic profit 
the table below reflects lifo income or expense representing decreases or increases in the lifo inventory reserve 
cmcz is not included in this table as it uses fifo valuation exclusively for its inventory three months ended twelve months ended august  august  in thousands domestic mills domestic fabrication recycling marketing and distribution consolidated increase decrease to adjusted profit before tax lifo income or expense includes a division classified as discontinued operations compared to domestic mills we include our four domestic steel minimills and our copper tube minimill in our domestic mills segment 
while fy set many benchmarks  record average selling prices and increased metal margins at the mills in fy helped to produce our second best year ever 
metal margins the difference between the average selling price and cost of scrap consumed for the segment increased in as compared to because increases in selling prices at our domestic steel mills more than offset the increases in scrap purchase and other input costs 

table of contents despite record high sales prices  increases in the scrap purchase cost and lower sales volume reduced our metal margins at our copper tube minimill 
lifo expense for remained flat as compared to within the segment adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for the year ended august  as compared to million for selling prices and metal margins increased in as compared to  however slowing market conditions in the fourth quarter compelled the mills to curtail production in order to lower finished goods inventories 
higher selling prices offset lower tons shipped resulting in sales increasing million in versus average scrap purchase costs were higher than last year as the world demand for ferrous scrap also remained strong

prices rose significantly in the fourth quarter almost back to the prices registered at the beginning of the year 
on a full year basis  electricity costs decreased by million and natural gas costs decreased by million 
year over year costs for ferroalloys  graphite electrodes and other supplies increased  while transportation rates rose significantly 
electrode costs per ton were up with the largest increase at cmc steel south carolina 
our copper tube minimill s adjusted operating profit was million for the year ended august  compared to million for while selling prices set another record high  our results were adversely impacted by lower shipment volumes and lower metal margins compared to the decline in housing starts coupled with the extraordinary high price of copper reduced the demand for copper plumbing tube across the us we matched production and inventory levels to coincide with order intake levels 
we were able to increase the average selling price for the year to per pound  a historical high  however metal spreads narrowed to per pound due to the increase in the cost of copper scrap and lower production volumes

our operating results were positively impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates during as compared to and resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately 
metal margins increased over driven by increases in prices but partially offset by increases in the ferrous scrap cost 
operating levels and shipments were also up compared to  including a increase in shipments 
a strong polish zloty encouraged steel imports and made exports difficult 
steel imports were particularly high in the second half of the year 
we continued our vertical integration strategy in central europe with the first full operating year of our new greenfield fabrication plant in zawiercie and the acquisition of all the operating assets of a steel fabrication business in rosslau saxony anhalt in eastern germany 
during fiscal our new scrap mega shredder in zawiercie was very successful and enabled us to sustain higher melt shop yields and lower melt shop costs 
in march of  we purchased all the shares of cmcz owned by the polish ministry of state treasury approximately of the outstanding shares 
cmc holds of all cmcz shares outstanding 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
we continued engineering our previously announced wire rod block  the new finishing end which will enable us to roll higher value products 
in the fourth quarter  we announced the future installation of a completely new rolling mill in zawiercie designed to allow efficient and flexible production of an increased medium section product range 
this major strategic expansion captures the full advantage of the underutilized melting capacity of cmcz s two existing electric arc furnaces 
domestic fabrication sales were up compared to  however  tons shipped were down and adjusted operating profit was down because the cost of steel increased resulting in margin squeeze 
the segment recorded million pre tax lifo expense for the year ended august  as compared to million expense in during fiscal  we acquired the operating assets of nicholas j 
bouras  inc and its affiliates 
this acquisition did not significantly impact our adjusted operating profit  however  the acquisition establishes cmc as a manufacturer of steel deck and expands cmc s geographic markets into the northeast

our operating results were positively impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates during as compared to and resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately 
lifo expenses were essentially flat as compared to last year s 
market conditions varied by product and geography  but overall were favorable 
steel tonnage was up in most of our markets  especially sales into the us  although sales dollars were mixed in various markets 
us steel import volumes and operating profits were strong although varied by product line 
international steel markets remained vibrant with increased pricing from the prior year 
the increase in chinese exports gave us additional sourcing opportunities in inter asia carbon steel products 
european imports were strong and our sales of aluminum  copper  brass and stainless steel semis were steady 
our value added downstream and processing businesses continued to perform well 
during  we received a dividend of czk million million from trinecke zelezarny  a czech steel mill in which we own of the outstanding shares as compared to a dividend of czk million million received in in august cmc s board approved the plan to offer to sell a division which is involved with the buying  selling and distribution of nonferrous metals 
the company expects the sale to occur in fiscal see note  discontinued operations and impairments  to the consolidated financial statements 
corporate and eliminations our corporate expenses for increased million over the prior year due primarily to million in costs incurred for our investment in the global installation of sap software 
the increase in total assets of million is due primarily to the increased sale of receivables from the business segments to the company s wholly owned subsidiary  cmcrv  and capitalization of million of software development costs 
we recognized income of million on investment assets in our segregated trust for our benefit restoration plan during the year ended august   as compared to million for see note  employees retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated data on a consolidated basis  the lifo method of inventory valuation decreased our net earnings by million and million cents and cents per diluted share for the years ended august  and  respectively 
our overall selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses increased by million for the year ended august  as compared to s  g a expense in includes million expense associated with our investment in the global deployment of sap software 
in addition  salaries  
table of contents discretionary incentive compensation and profit sharing expense increased because of company growth  including acquisitions 
our interest expense increased by million during as compared to primarily due to the issuance of million in senior unsecured notes due in july  an increase in letters of credit fees in the marketing and distribution and an increase in bank fees incurred as our average outstanding balance of commercial paper increased in our effective tax rate for the year ended august  decreased to as compared to in due to shifts in profitability among tax jurisdictions 
near term outlook the prospects are very good for another strong year for cmc in we believe the year will be typical with a good first quarter followed by a slower second quarter winter months and then a strong finish in the third and fourth quarters 
the housing market slump and the more recent sub prime mortgage crisis credit squeeze have slowed the us economy 
the global economies remain relatively solid  although in europe there are some signs of slowing growth 
nonresidential construction remains strong in the us and in most global markets 
this is the key driver for our business 
the strong results should carry forward into a good first quarter for our domestic mills should have a solid first quarter particularly if shipments to service centers and rebar fabricators improve 
our us recycling segment should have a good quarter based on relatively high ferrous scrap prices  good shipping volumes and a healthy nonferrous global scrap market 
margins on shredder ferrous scrap should continue to be squeezed due to the overcapacity of shredders in the us our us fabrication business should have a solid quarter based on a very good backlog at good prices 
our steel import distribution business in the us is likely to be negatively impacted by the rapid decline in steel imports 
our copper tube mill should continue to perform well with shipping volumes and margins relatively stable 
internationally  our polish mill cmcz should have a profitable quarter  although lower than the fourth quarter of fiscal our newly acquired mill in croatia cmc sisak is a turnaround situation but may have a slight negative impact on first quarter results 
the international fabrication and distribution operations should have a solid quarter  although down from fourth quarter fiscal results 
steel imports into the us will continue to fall significantly 
as well  consolidation of steel producers in the us has resulted in more supply discipline 
service centers inventory levels for most steel products are the lowest in two years 
the combination of lower steel imports  producer supply discipline and lower inventory levels should result in stable  if not slowly increasing  shipping levels  stable margins and prices with an upward bias 
globally  china has reduced steel exports through removal of vat tax rebates and new export taxes 
the impact should be higher international steel prices 
as well  contract iron ore prices are likely to increase significantly which will result in higher steel prices 
ferrous scrap prices  while remaining volatile  should also trend upwards 
ocean freight rates should remain at high levels due to the demand for iron ore  coal and other key raw materials 
we anticipate investments for fiscal will be million including routine capex million  erp million  the arizona micro mill and flexible rolling mill in poland million and other acquisitions investments million 
long term outlook while there will be cycles within cycles  the long term business cycle should continue to trend upward 
the global demand for raw materials and steel for nonresidential construction  including infrastructure  should remain strong 
the consumption growth rate of steel in emerging countries including china  india  russia  brazil  central and eastern europe  southeast asia  north africa and the middle east should at least match the gdp growth rate of these countries and in many cases be higher 
china should continue to curb steel exports through a combination of export taxes and environmental regulations which will shut down old steel capacity 
consolidation of steel producers is likely to continue globally resulting in supply discipline 
highway spending and infrastructure requirements in the us are likely to increase 
nonresidential construction in general should remain at healthy levels 
the us dollar is likely to remain weak which is a natural barrier for steel imports into the us as well  ocean freight rates are likely to remain high 
historically  the us has had the lowest 
table of contents ferrous scrap prices in the world and this trend is likely to continue with the us remaining a net exporter of ferrous scrap 
we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities in certain global emerging markets 
in the us  we believe our vertical integration business model will allow us to remain very competitive 
we are optimistic that we are in a global super cycle which will last several years driven by the demands of emerging countries for housing  highways  airports  ports  manufacturing facilities  commercial and public buildings and other nonresidential projects 
the sheer size of the populations in many of these emerging countries dwarfs those countries which benefited from the last super cycle of the s and s 
compared to domestic mills we include our four domestic steel minimills and our copper tube minimill in our domestic mills segment 
in  our domestic mills segment set another all time annual record for adjusted operating profits 
higher selling prices  metal margins and volumes at our domestic steel mills in as compared to helped net sales and adjusted operating profit continue to grow 
metal margins the difference between the average selling price and cost of scrap consumed for the segment increased in as compared to because increases in selling prices at our domestic steel mills more than offset the increases in scrap purchase and other input costs 
in addition  historically high sales prices and metal margins helped our copper tube minimill achieve record adjusted operating profit 
the high prices of steel and copper scrap caused lifo expense for to be at a very high million as compared to million in within the segment adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for the year ended august  as compared to million for this million increase in adjusted operating profit is even more remarkable considering contained million of insurance recoveries 
selling prices and metal margins increased in as compared to due to continued strong global demand for steel 
volumes shipped were also up at all four mills compared to average scrap purchase costs were higher than last year as the world demand for ferrous scrap also remained strong

operating levels and shipments were also up compared to  including a increase in shipments 
functional currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact on adjusted operating profits 
the startup and operation of the new mega shredder during the fourth quarter of was successful  and the greenfield rebar fabrication plant in zawiercie had a successful start in july domestic fabrication tons shipped in were up and sales were up compared to  however  adjusted operating profit was down because the cost of steel was up considerably resulting in some margin squeeze and lifo expense increased over lifo expense increased dramatically because of the higher steel price and more inventories on hand

marketing and distribution the primary reason for the decrease in adjusted operating profit was a significant million lifo expense increase in fiscal as compared to the increase in lifo expense was caused mainly by higher prices for aluminum  copper and stainless steel inventories and increased prices and inventory levels of long and flat rolled steel product 
market conditions varied by product and geography  but overall were favorable 
steel tonnage was up in most of our markets  especially sales into the us  although sales dollars were mixed in various markets 
aluminum  copper and stainless semis were characterized by higher prices but lower volumes  which on balance resulted in higher gross margins  but higher transaction costs as well 
sales and margins for industrial materials and products  though solid  were off the peaks of last year reflecting mostly weaker market conditions and volatile prices

cash flows our cash flows from operating activities primarily result from sales of steel and related products  and to a lesser extent  sales of nonferrous metal products 
we also sell and rent construction related products and accessories 
we have a diverse and generally stable customer base 
we use futures or forward contracts as needed to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and metals commodity prices 
see note  financial instruments  market and credit risk  to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended august   we generated million of net cash flows from our operating activities as compared to the million of net cash flows provided by our operating activities for the year ended august  significant fluctuations in working capital were as follows lower accounts receivable more sales of accounts receivable 
increased inventories higher carrying costs  increased volume and more in transit inventory  offset by a higher lifo reserve 
increased other assets increase in segregated assets held in trust related to deferred compensation liability and higher inventory of construction related rental assets 

table of contents we invested million in property  plant and equipment during the year ended august   which was more than the million spent during during  we spent million for the acquisitions of businesses as compared to million in and million in additionally  we spent million in to acquire the minority shares of cmcz from the polish government and other minority shareholders 
during the year ended august   we received million from stock issued under our employee incentive and stock purchase plans as compared to million in and million in we purchased  shares of our common stock during the year ended august  at per share for a total of million 
during and  we spent million and million  respectively  to acquire our common stock 
we paid dividends of million during the year ended august  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
starting in the second quarter of the company increased the quarterly cash dividend to cents per share 
our contractual obligations for the next twelve months of billion are typically expenditures to be paid in the ordinary course of revenue generating activities 
we believe our cash flows from operating activities and debt facilities are adequate to fund our ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of august  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt interest operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have not discounted the cash obligations in this table 
total amounts are included in the august  consolidated balance sheet 
see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest payments related to our short term debt are not included in the table as they do not represent a significant obligation as of august  includes minimum lease payment obligations for non cancelable equipment and real estate leases in effect as of august  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
approximately of these purchase obligations are for inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations include all enforceable  legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms  regardless of the duration of the agreement 
agreements with variable terms are excluded because we are unable to estimate the minimum amounts 
other commercial commitments we maintain stand by letters of credit to provide support for certain transactions that our customers or suppliers request 
at august   we had committed million under these arrangements 
all commitments expire within one year 
in february  we entered into a guarantee agreement to assist one of our chinese coke suppliers to obtain pre production financing from a bank 
in addition  we entered into another guarantee agreement for one of our suppliers of finished goods to obtain working capital financing from a financial institution 
in aggregate  the company s maximum exposure under the guarantees at august  was million 
the fair value of the guarantees is negligible 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the estimable probable impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular quarter 
environmental and other matters see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
general we are subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations 
we anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will involve continuing capital expenditures and operating costs 
our original business and one of our core businesses for over nine decades is metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  we are committed to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  are contrary to the goal of greater recycling 
such regulations expose us and the industry to potentially significant risks 
we believe that recycled materials are commodities that are diverted by recyclers  such as us  from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
environmental agencies at various federal and state levels classify certain recycled materials as hazardous substances and subject recyclers to material remediation costs  fines and penalties 
taken to extremes  such actions could cripple the recycling industry and undermine any national goal of material conservation 
enforcement  interpretation  and litigation involving these regulations are not well developed 
solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease  and in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used in our operations 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of several such properties 
state and federal laws applicable to wastes and contaminated properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under new laws  we could be required to remediate properties impacted by previously disposed wastes 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp at a number of contaminated sites 
we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state and or local statutes where we operate 
these statutes  regulations and laws may have limited disposal options for certain wastes 
superfund the us environmental protection agency epa or an equivalent state agency notified us that we are considered a prp at thirteen sites  none owned by us 
we may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla or a similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
we are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting  or at the appropriate time we may contest  our liability at the sites 
in addition  we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
because of various factors  including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages 
table of contents and cleanup costs and the extended time periods over which such costs may be incurred  we cannot reasonably estimate our ultimate costs of compliance with cercla 
at august   based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  we believe that our aggregate liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with eight of the thirteen sites will be between million and million 
we have accrued for these liabilities based upon our best estimates 
we are not able to estimate the possible range of loss on the other sites 
the amounts paid and the expenses incurred on these thirteen sites for the year ended august   and were not material 
historically  the amounts that we have ultimately paid for such remediation activities have not been material 
clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined 
these controls have become more stringent over time and it is probable that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future 
permits must generally be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters  comparable permits may be required at the state level 
the cwa and many state agencies provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants 
in addition  the epa has promulgated regulations that may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
clean air act our operations are subject to regulations at the federal  state and local level for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
new and modified sources of air pollutants are often required to obtain permits prior to commencing construction  modification and or operations 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent requirements  including the potential need for additional permits and to increased scrutiny in the context of enforcement 
the epa has been implementing its stationary emission control program through expanded enforcement of the new source review program 
under this program  new or modified sources are required to construct what is referred to as the best available control technology 
additionally  the epa is implementing new  more stringent standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
the epa recently has promulgated new national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for steel mills which will require all major sources in this category to meet the standards by reflecting application of maximum achievable control technology 
compliance with the new standards could require additional expenditures 
in fiscal  we incurred environmental expenses of million 
the expenses included the cost of environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessments  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
approximately million of our capital expenditures for related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
at august   million was accrued for environmental liabilities of which million was classified as other long term liabilities 
business interruption insurance claims see note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
dividends we have paid quarterly cash dividends in each of the past consecutive quarters 
we paid dividends in our fiscal year at the rate of cents per share for the first quarter and cents per share for the last three quarters

the following types of derivative instruments were outstanding at august   in accordance with our risk management program 
currency exchange forwards we enter into currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of international trade commitments denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  or  if the transaction involves our australian or european subsidiaries  their local currency 
no single foreign currency poses a primary risk to us 
fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 

table of contents commodity prices we base pricing in some of our sales and purchase contracts on forward metal commodity exchange quotes which we determine at the beginning of the contract 
due to the volatility of the metal commodity indexes  we enter into metal commodity forward or futures contracts for copper  aluminum  nickel and zinc 
these forwards or futures mitigate the risk of unanticipated declines in gross margins on these contractual commitments 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to small gains and losses from ineffectiveness 
interest rates if interest rates increased or decreased by one percentage point  the effect on interest expense related to our variable rate debt and the fair value of our long term debt would be approximately thousand and million  respectively
