item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance  and to a limited extent annuities  to middle income households throughout the united states 
we view our operations by segments  which are the major insurance product lines of life  health  and annuities  and the investment segment that supports the product lines 
segments are aligned based on their common characteristics  comparability of the profit margins  and management techniques used to operate each segment 
insurance product line segments 
as fully described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the product line segments involve the marketing  underwriting  and benefit administration of policies 
each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies 
each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market 
whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole  or the individual distribution units within the segment  the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin  which is premium revenue less policy obligations policy acquisition costs and commissions investment segment 
the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources  including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity 
our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income  which is net investment income less interest credited to net policy liabilities financing costs the tables in note business segments reconcile torchmark s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three year period ending december  additionally  this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year to year comparability and which reconciles to net income 
that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark s operations on a segment by segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 
summary of operations net income increased or million to million in  and or million to million in the primary contributor to growth in earnings was the health insurance segment  as we first offered medicare part d for coverage beginning january  our medicare part d product accounted for million of the million growth in health margins 
the life insurance segment also added million to our million growth in pretax earnings in the million growth in earnings came primarily from the life insurance segment  as it accounted for million of pretax earnings growth 
excess investment income declined in both years  as it continues to be compressed by a flattened yield curve and as increasing amounts of cash are used to repurchase torchmark shares 
life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december   rising in to billion and in margins as a percentage of premium have also increased slightly each year from of premium in to in and the combination of premium and margin percentage growth has resulted in increases in the total life contribution to pretax earnings mentioned above 
however  sales volumes have declined slightly each year 
life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption life insurance 
health premium rose or million to billion in  but million of the growth came from medicare part d premium 
health premium declined in medicare supplement accounts for the largest portion of our health premium 
over the past few years  increased competition in the medicare supplement business has continued to dampen health sales  and has resulted in declines in the premium from this product each year 
however  net sales of our under age limited benefit health products have grown significantly over the past few years  as demand for these products continues to increase 
see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

table of contents while we still offer annuities  we do not plan to emphasize annuity products  favoring life insurance instead 
see the caption annuities for further discussion 
the investment segment s pretax profitability declined in each of the last two years  falling million in and million in growth in total investment income has been negatively affected by torchmark s share repurchase program described later under this caption  which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments 
management believes that the acquisition of torchmark stock at favorable prices provides a superior return on available cash 
additionally  the low long term interest rates available for new investments during the past three years have caused our average portfolio yield to decline in each successive year  restricting growth in net investment income and excess investment income 
beginning in late and continuing through mid  excess investment income was further compressed as short term rates rose with no meaningful change in long term rates 
the increase in short term rates caused short term financing costs to increase and the income spread on torchmark s fixed to variable interest rate swaps to narrow 
because of the diminished profitability of these swaps  all of the swaps were disposed of by june  see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments for a more detailed discussion 
during the second quarter of  we issued two new debt securities in separate public offerings our trust preferred securities  redemption amount million and our senior notes  par value million 
these offerings essentially provided funding for the repayment of two existing debt instruments in the fourth quarter of the call of our trust preferred securities at a redemption price of million and the maturity of our senior notes  par value million 
more information on these transactions can be found in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 
total revenues rose in to billion 
in  total revenues increased to billion from billion in the revenue increase was primarily the result of the million of premium added from medicare part d 
growth in life premium and net investment income also contributed to revenue growth 
life premium was the greatest contributor to the revenue increase  but net investment income was also a positive factor 
we had million of after tax realized investment losses in  compared with an immaterial amount of after tax realized investment gains in and gains of million in realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
under the caption realized gains and losses in this report  we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses 
also  as explained in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments 
in each of the years through  net income was affected by certain significant  unusual  and nonrecurring nonoperating items 
we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations 
a discussion of these items follows 
in  we received four litigation and tax settlements  two of which were concerned with issues related to a subsidiary and an investment disposed of several years ago  a third involving our investment in worldcom  inc bonds worldcom  which was held and sold in prior years  and a fourth concerning federal income tax issues arising from examinations of prior years 
the first settlement  involving the disposed subsidiary  resulted in state income tax refunds of million net of expenses million net of tax which were received and reported above as a tax settlement 
the second settlement involving the investment resulted in proceeds of million net of expenses million net of tax and is included in the table above as a legal settlement 
in the third settlement  we received million million after tax in connection with our worldcom class action litigation for recovery of a portion of investment losses 
this item is included in the table above as a litigation settlement 
the federal income tax settlement resulted in benefits due us of million  included as tax settlements in the table above 
the two litigation settlements were included in other income and the two tax settlements reduced income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 
all four of these cases involved litigation or issues arising years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations 

table of contents additionally in  our subsidiary liberty national began a program to dispose of its agency office buildings  replacing them with rental facilities 
in  buildings were sold for gross proceeds of million and a pre tax gain of million 
because of the significant scale of this nonoperating item  we have removed million million after tax from our core results representing the gain from the sales 
we contemplate this program to continue into in  we recorded an after tax charge of thousand million pretax pertaining to litigation 
this litigation involved net settlements after expenses primarily in three significant legal matters our subsidiary liberty national s race distinct mortality dual pricing litigation  its class action cancer case  and the waddell reed litigation 
all of the settlements of these cases relate to litigation arising many years ago and are not relevant to current operations 
of this pre tax amount  million is recorded as other income and million is recorded as other operating expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
for more information on these litigation items  see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
also in  we recorded a million settlement benefit from an internal revenue service examination covering several years 
this tax settlement reduced tax expense 
more information on this tax settlement is provided in note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  a noncash after tax charge of thousand was recorded as a result of the extension in the term of a previously granted stock option for a senior officer upon retirement 
the option extension expense was recorded as administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of january   torchmark adopted statement of position sop  an accounting rule concerning guaranteed minimum policy benefits on variable annuities 
the adoption of this standard resulted in a one time after tax charge of million recorded as a change in accounting principle 
also  during  we received a refund of state income taxes in the amount of million  after federal tax 
this refund resulted from the settlement of certain state tax issues concerning a discontinued operation in the mid s 
the refund reduced income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in and was reaffirmed at its july  board of director s meeting 
with no specified authorization amount  we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company s excess cash flow  general market conditions  and other alternative uses 
the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable 
additionally  when stock options are exercised  proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises 
the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december  analysis of share purchases amounts in thousands purchases shares amount shares amount shares amount excess cash flow option proceeds total in  million shares at a cost of million related to the option restoration program more fully discussed under the caption capital resources 
throughout the remainder of this discussion  share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow 
a discussion of each of torchmark s segments follows 

table of contents life insurance 
life insurance is our largest insurance segment  with life premium representing of total premium 
life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented of the total in additionally  investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 
life insurance premium rose to billion in and in to billion 
life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels 
premium by channel for each of the last three years is as follows 
life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency military agency other agencies we use four statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term annualized premium in force  annualized premium issued  net sales  and first year collected premium 
annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve month period 
annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue 
annualized premium issued sold is that amount of annualized premium in force added from new sales in a given period  and is an indicator of the acceleration of premium growth 
net sales is annualized premium issued  net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue  except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired 
we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued 
first year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year 
first year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur  and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december   an increase of over billion a year earlier 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december  the following table shows net sales information for each of the last three years by distribution method 
life insurance net sales by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency military agency other agencies 
table of contents the table below discloses first year collected life premium by distribution channel 
life insurance first year collected premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency military agency other agencies direct response is our leading writer of life insurance 
marketing is conducted through direct mail  but also through co op mailings  television and consumer magazine advertising  and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups  unions and associations 
this distribution channel markets a line of life products primarily to juveniles  their parents  and other adults over age the direct response operation accounted for of our life insurance premium during  the largest of any distribution group 
direct response s share of total life premium has risen steadily in each of the last three years 
life premium for this channel rose in and in this group s focus is on its juvenile life product 
not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales  but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile insureds 
parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a solicitation by direct response for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population 
also  both the juveniles and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 
we expect that sales to the juvenile market and their parents will continue as one of this group s premier markets 
we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance 
in january   we acquired direct marketing and advertising distributors  inc dmad  an advertising and publication company which has supplied insert media and marketing services to our direct response operation for the past fifteen years 
we believe the acquisition should provide direct response with significant cost savings and potential increases in solicitation volume 
direct response net sales rose in to million and in to million 
first year collected premium grew in to million and rose to million in we believe that the dmad purchase will favorably impact direct response sales going forward 
the american income exclusive agency focuses on members of labor unions  credit unions  and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
life premium for this agency rose to million in  after having increased in net sales increased in to million from million in net sales declined in first year collected premium declined in to million  after having decreased in as in the case of all of torchmark s agency distribution systems  continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count 
growth in the agent count has contributed to the improvements in sales in this agency 
net sales  a lead indicator of new sales  rose after two years of declines 
additionally  the decline in first year collected premium was reduced in the american income agent count was  at december  compared with  a year earlier  an increase of 
the agent count declined in from  at year end this agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business 
additionally  our systematic  centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents 

table of contents the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets its life products to primarily middle income customers in southeastern states  but has recently expanded into several other states 
liberty s life premium declined slightly in both and compared with the respective prior year 
liberty s life premium sales  in terms of net sales  were million in  representing a decrease of in after having decreased in first year collected premium declined in to million 
first year collected premium declined in growth in the liberty agency s sales and premium volume are highly dependent on building the size of its agency force 
liberty had  producing agents at year end  compared with  at year end  a decline of 
this decline was the primary factor in sales declines 
while the agent count in this agency rose in  it fell in in  the liberty national agency began the reorganization of its marketing leadership and restructured its agent compensation system to provide greater reward to productive agents and to establish production minimums for agents 
these changes led to terminations and resignations during of agents not meeting these production minimums 
however  management believes that these changes will result in a more productive agency over the long term 
management also believes these changes will result in margin improvements 
also  liberty has implemented initiatives similar to those of american income to recruit new agents  primarily through the use of the internet 
as these agents become more seasoned  they should become more productive 
the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
increased sales from a larger and more productive agency force should lead to increased premium growth 
our military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates 
in  life premium was million or of torchmark s total life premium 
premium increased in from million 
premium rose in this agency has broadened its portfolio to provide a much more comprehensive selection of other products non torchmark 
it has reduced commission rates on non torchmark investment products and  as a result  lost of the producing agents appointed with torchmark in and lost an additional of agents in while this agency recently broadened its target market to include non military customers  sales in this agency have fallen sharply 
military agency net sales declined in to million after having declined in to million 
first year collected premium declined in to million after a decline of 
margins in the military group improved in as a result of the decline in mortality 
in and  margins were negatively affected by hostilities in the middle east  resulting in higher than expected benefits paid of million in and million in benefits paid for these hostilities in were million 
we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the united investors agency  the united american independent and branch office agencies  and other small miscellaneous sales agencies 
the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business 
united investors represents approximately of torchmark s life premium income 
the united american independent and branch office agencies combined represented approximately of torchmark s total life premium 
life premium income and sales for these two agencies has declined for the past three years because they focus on health insurance  with life sales being incidental 

table of contents life insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands amount of premium amount of premium amount of premium premium and policy charges policy obligations required interest on reserves net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes amortization of acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses gross margins  as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense  rose in to million after rising in and in as a percentage of life insurance premium  gross margins have increased slightly each year 
improvements in life margins have resulted from several factors 
the previously mentioned changes in liberty s agent compensation system has contributed to increases in liberty s margins  as this system has reduced acquisition costs at liberty 
additionally  the proportion of american income premium to total premium has grown each year  and that has caused life margins to increase because that agency s margins are torchmark s highest  well exceeding in mortality improvement in the military agency noted above was also a major factor 

table of contents health insurance 
health products sold by torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limited benefit hospital surgical plans  cancer  and accident plans sold to people under age we also sell medicare supplements to enrollees in the federal medicare program  as well as providing coverage under the medicare part d prescription drug program after january  because medicare part d is a significant new health product and there is no comparative prior year data  medicare part d business will be shown as a separate health component and will be discussed separately in the analysis of the health segment 
health premium represented of torchmark s total premium income in excluding part d premium  health premium represented in  compared with in and in health underwriting margin accounted for of the total in both and  excluding part d in  compared with in these declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment 
the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years 
health insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total united american independent agency limited benefit plans medicare supplement united american branch office agency limited benefit plans medicare supplement liberty national exclusive agency limited benefit plans medicare supplement american income exclusive agency limited benefit plans medicare supplement direct response limited benefit plans medicare supplement total premium before part d limited benefit plans medicare supplement total premium before part d medicare part d total health premium we market supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels with the two united american agencies being our market leaders 
over the past several years  we have placed greater emphasis on the sale of limited benefit health insurance products rather than medicare supplement insurance as customer demand for the limited benefit hospital surgical plans has increased and price competition and lesser demand for medicare supplements has dampened sales of that product 
while medicare supplement still remains our largest health product in terms of premium income  the 
table of contents premium from other limited benefit health products have been growing rapidly 
as shown in the chart above  medicare supplement premium represented of total health premium excluding part d in  but has declined steadily as a percentage of total health premium in each successive year 
accordingly  limited benefit health products have increased as a percentage of total health premium before part d each year during the same period

as discussed above  the two united american agencies have emphasized sales of individual supplemental limited benefit health plans known generally as hospital surgical plans for which demand has increased in recent years 
these plans generally provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined  a fixed amount surgical schedule  out patient coverage  and other miscellaneous hospital related charges 
they also contain caps on total per illness benefits 
consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual major medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers 
minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limited benefit plans are generally lower than those of medicare supplement  however  the medicare supplement product has historically had slightly higher persistency rates  resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium 
both of the united american agencies offer these limited benefit plans 
the united american branch office is an exclusive agency  meaning the agents in its offices nationwide sell only for us 
in recent years  this agency has been successful in building sales of limited benefit plans to replace the decline in medicare supplement sales 
net sales of limited benefit plans in were million  an increase 
net sales in were million  a increase over 
table of contents as a result  total health sales at the ua branch office were million  a increase over  including the decline in medicare supplement sales 
premium from limited benefit plans at the ua branch office increased by to million in compared with  and total health premium grew to million  after taking the decline in the medicare supplement in force block into account 
premium in and remained relatively unchanged at million 
at year end  the ua branch office had  producing agents compared with  at year end  a increase 
this agency had  agents at year end as is the case with all of our captive agencies  growing the agency size translates into increased sales and premium growth 
the united american independent agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large  multi state organizations down to one person offices 
all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies  of which  were active producing agents for torchmark at december  health premium for the ua independent agency declined to million in  after declining in the declines in premium are due to the decreases in medicare supplement premium 
this block of business continues to decline as sales have not compensated for lapses 
this agency s contribution to torchmark s total health sales and premium has declined in each of the past three years 
however  limited benefit premium has risen each year in this agency and was of agency premium in  compared with in and in even though net sales of limited benefit products declined in each of the last three years  each year s new sales have added to premium in force  resulting in the increases in limited benefit premium 
in the recent past  most of this agency s health sales came from one large independent agency 
in  that leading agency s recruiting and training program experienced a disruption that resulted in a decline in producing agents 
the disruption resulted in a drop in net sales 
sales from this agency did not recover in liberty national exclusive agency  predominately a life insurance distribution channel  is the third largest writer of torchmark health business based on premium collected 
cancer supplemental plans are the type of limited benefit health products primarily produced by this agency 
liberty is our only distribution channel for which cancer insurance is its primary health product 
liberty s health premium declined in to million after a drop in the declines in both years were the result of the settlement of a class action lawsuit in early concerning a closed block of cancer business over the timing and size of the premium rate increases on this block 
this block represented approximately half of liberty s cancer business in and approximately at year end prior to  significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on this block were a continuing factor causing growth in health premium  but increasing claims continued to reduce underwriting margins 
the settlement provided for claims incurred after the effective date of the settlement in march to be paid on an actual incurred basis  rather than a billed basis  which reduced benefits paid going forward 
the settlement further required liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business 
prior to the settlement  liberty had a claims loss ratio above on this block 
net health sales in the liberty agency for declined to million  compared with net health sales of million 
net health sales were million in the declines in agent counts discussed above are the major cause of these fluctuations  as well as increased emphasis on selling the higher margin life products 
american income exclusive agency  also predominately a life insurance distribution channel  is our fourth largest health insurance distributor based on premium collected 
its health plans are comprised of various limited benefit plans for which almost two thirds of the agency s health premium was from accident policies 
sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 
health premium at this agency for increased to million  while premium of million increased over net health sales of million in rose over sales  but net sales declined 
net health sales comprised only of the american income agency s total net sales in direct response  primarily a life operation  also offers health insurance  which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups 
in  net health sales 
table of contents were million  comprising only of direct response s total life and health net sales 
these net sales declined in net health sales declined in to million 
health premium in for this group rose to million 
health premium in was million  a increase compared with million in medicare part d 
in  united american contracted with centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to be an insurer under the government s new medicare part d stand alone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries 
unlike the traditional medicare program for hospital and doctor services  where cms is the primary insurer and private medicare supplement insurers like united american are secondary insurers  insurers participating in part d are the primary insurers for plans regulated and funded in part by cms 
the program generally calls for cms to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium 
total medicare part d premium was million in at november   united american still had thousand enrollees in the part d plan 
for the plan  we enrolled an additional thousand  but thousand of the enrollees left our plan 
enrollment for coverage ended december  our medicare part d product is sold primarily through the direct response operation  but is also sold by the two ua agencies 
we believe that the medicare part d program is an excellent addition to our health product offerings because of our experience with the senior age market and with medicare supplements  the government assurances with regard to the risk sharing agreements for participating insurers  the incremental income added to our health insurance margins  and the renewal of the business every year 
our experience with service to the senior age market and use of our direct response marketing system required little new investment to enter this business 
as previously mentioned  we view the medicare part d product separately from our other health products because of its significance and because there are no prior year comparisons 
we do not expect significant growth in the part d product in the near future  as most medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a plan in additionally  as with any government sponsored program  the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market

in  margin rose even though there was a decline in premium 
as a percentage of premium  underwriting margin increased from in to in  after having risen from in these increases were largely the result of the reduced loss ratios in the previously mentioned closed block of cancer business at liberty and improvements in american income s loss ratios  especially in liberty s health margins increased million or in  or of health premium 
they rose another million to million in  representing of premium 
american income s margins rose million to million in  of premium 
annuities 
fixed and variable annuity products are sold on a limited basis by our subsidiaries 
annuities represented of torchmark s premium revenue and less than of insurance underwriting margin 
we no longer emphasize this segment 
annuities summary of results dollar amounts in thousands policy charges policy obligations required interest on reserves net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes amortization of acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses annuities generate earnings from periodic policy fees and charges based on the average account balances  reduced by net policy obligations and acquisition costs 
for fixed annuities  net required interest on reserves is the required interest credited to the accounts and is offset by investment income 
for all three periods shown in the chart above  account balances declined  which resulted in reductions in policy fees and charges 
policy obligations also declined in each period 
as a result  insurance underwriting margin for annuities before other income and administrative expenses declined in each period and was million in as a percentage of policy charges  margins improved each year over the prior year 
margins in were benefited by a decline in guaranteed minimum policy benefits to 
million from million in  as a result of an increase in equity markets in equity markets were somewhat stable in in all three periods  investment income earned exceeded required interest credited to fixed accounts 
a significant portion of annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements 
this spread results in negative net policy obligations

million in and million in additionally  revenues in include two litigation settlements in the combined amount of million and revenues in include a litigation settlement of million  all of which are nonoperating items concerning issues arising in prior years 
because realized gains and losses and nonoperating items bear no relationship to core operations  we remove the effect of these items from revenue when evaluating expense ratios 
as noted in the summary of operations in this discussion  we do not consider the costs of settling certain significant litigation in applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations 
also  as stated in note business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense  and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 
insurance administrative expenses as a percentage of premium declined to in from in  after having increased from in the decline in the ratio occurred even after including million of medicare part d direct administrative expense for the first time in decreased legal costs were a primary factor  as several ongoing issues were resolved in and the increase was primarily due to a million payroll tax charge related to the option exercise and restoration program incurred in  which program is discussed under the caption capital resources in this report

it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment 
it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding  representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company 
since implementing its share repurchase program in  we have used billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives 
share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest bearing assets  but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding 
in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis  we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 
excess investment income declined in to million from million in it also declined in but rose in on a per diluted share basis  excess investment income rose to  however 
per share excess investment income increased in and in growth in excess investment income is impacted by increases in investment income due to the growth in the portfolio and changes in rates available in financial markets 
it is also affected by crediting rates on policy liabilities and changes in our borrowing costs 
additionally  share purchases in recent periods have caused excess investment income per share to grow faster than excess investment income 

table of contents the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income  which rose to million in it rose to million in from million in as presented in the following chart  the growth in net investment income in both periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets 
growth in net investment income growth in mean invested assets at amortized cost the lower growth in income is reflective of new investments made each year at long term yields lower than the portfolio s average yield  resulting from the lower rates available in financial markets in recent years 
also contributing to the lower growth in yields in recent years were calls on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio  as the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities 
given the sizeable annual cash flow from our operations  we expect mean invested assets to continue to grow  but as long as rates available for new investments do not exceed our portfolio yield  the rate of growth of investment income will be under pressure 
more detailed information about investment acquisitions follows under this caption 
excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt 
information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 
interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities dollar amounts in millions interest credited average net insurance policy liabilities average crediting rate life and health annuity total increase in life and health annuity total increase in life and health annuity total increase in excess investment income was positively affected by reduced crediting rates on certain policy liabilities in accordingly  the growth in interest credited to policy liabilities was not as great as the growth in the liabilities  as we were able to respond to the low interest environment with reduced crediting rates on fixed annuities and certain life products 
while annuity crediting rates were reduced in  we were not able to further reduce life and health crediting rates in nor any crediting rates in for more information on life and health crediting rates  please refer to note future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs 
financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income

see derivatives in note the table below presents the components of financing costs 
analysis of financing costs amounts in thousands interest on funded debt interest on short term debt other reclassification of interest due to deconsolidation subtotal of interest expense benefit from interest rate swaps financing costs financing costs increased or million in they rose or million in the increases in financing costs were caused by increased short term rates in financial markets which impacted us in several ways 
most notable was the effect that rising short rates had on our interest rate swaps  which we originally entered into to exchange our fixed interest commitments for floating rate commitments 
in the low interest environment experienced in the past several years  these swaps provided us with a considerable spread between our actual interest cost and what our fixed interest cost would have been 
in late  a profitable ten year swap expired 
we earned million in from this swap  one major factor in the increase in financing costs 
in  short term rates began to rise for the next two years  resulting in significant declines in the benefit of all of our other swaps 
because of the possibility that continued rising short term rates could cause our spreads to become negative  we disposed of all swap instruments as of the second quarter of nevertheless  the reductions in positive spreads on settlements from all swaps caused financing costs to increase million in and million in over the prior periods 
as a result of the dispositions of the swaps  our only exposure to variable rates at december  was our commercial paper borrowing program  of which million was outstanding 
in addition to their impact on our swaps  rising short term rates were also the primary factor in increased interest on our commercial paper borrowings  million in and million in another major factor in the increase in financing costs in was the refinancing of two funded debt issues 
our senior notes million principal amount matured in the fourth quarter of our 
table of contents trust preferred securities million redemption value became callable also in the fourth quarter of and we elected to call them 
these repayments were essentially funded by the issuance of two new instruments in the second quarter of  our senior notes million principal amount and our trust preferred securities million principal amount 
because the new issues were offered several months before the other securities were repaid  interest on funded debt increased million 
it should be noted  however  that we invested the proceeds of the new offerings and the investment income from those proceeds offset the increased financing costs  having little impact on total excess investment income 
more information concerning the debt offerings  repayments  and swaps is disclosed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our primary investment goal is to maintain a positive spread between the yield on investments and the yield on our interest bearing policy liabilities and debt 
it is this positive spread that results in excess investment income 
at the same time  we seek investments predominately in publicly traded investment grade corporate fixed income securities 
in periods of lower long term rates  achieving our goal becomes more challenging 
when yields available on high quality long term over years securities are sufficient to meet our yield and spread objectives  we generally prefer to invest in longer term securities  which also more closely match the long term nature of our policy liabilities 
however  we do not want to invest for long durations at rates less than our minimum yield target 
therefore  during periods when we cannot obtain our minimum target yield  we will invest shorter term 
at year end  our current minimum target yield was about 
in the last several years of a lower interest rate environment  there have been periods when yields on acceptable securities have been below our minimum target yield and we have invested shorter term 
these periods have also been characterized by a flat or inverted yield curve with short term rates about the same as long term rates 
in these periods  we could obtain yields that were equivalent to long rates without the greater credit risks of long term securities 
we were also provided with an earlier opportunity to reinvest the proceeds at higher rates at maturity 
prior to early  we addressed the new lower interest rate environment by lengthening the maturities of new investment purchases to maximize the yield 
at that time there was still a significant spread of long term yields over short term  even though yields on new long term investments began to decline 
however  short term rates began to rise in late and continued to do so throughout and early into without a significant change in long term rates  resulting in a flattened yield curve 
at that time we implemented our alternative strategy to invest shorter term when the available long term yield fell below our minimum target yield  as described above 
in mid  long term rates rose slightly  allowing us to invest at or above our minimum target yield while buying long term securities 
the lower long term yields accompanied by higher short term yields experienced during the past two years have had a considerable restricting effect on excess investment income  causing it to decline in each of the past two years from the prior year 
however  in the event of an increase in long term rates  excess investment income will benefit as new acquisitions can be made at higher yields 
even though short term rates could rise along with long term rates  higher long term rates would be to torchmark s advantage because the amount of cash invested annually significantly exceeds the amount of our floating rate debt  and would result in greater investment income net of financing costs under most yield curve scenarios 

table of contents acquisitions 
the chart below presents selected information about torchmark s fixed maturity acquisitions in the years through investment grade corporate securities include both bonds and trust preferred securities classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors 
both yield and average life calculations on new purchases of noncallable bonds are based on the maturity date 
in the case of callable bonds  the average life is based on the call date or maturity date  whichever produces the lowest yield yield to worst 
fixed maturity acquisitions selected information dollar amounts in millions for the year cost of acquisitions investment grade corporate securities other investment grade securities total fixed maturity acquisitions average yield effective annual yield average life in years  to worst call we continue to invest exclusively in investment grade fixed maturities 
as previously discussed  we attempted to maximize yield on new investments in the low interest environment in and early by lengthening maturities 
our strategy changed in mid through mid to invest in shorter maturities  and then changed back to longer maturities in the latter part of as a result  the average life of new fixed maturity acquisitions was years in  falling to years in  and then rising to years in the effective annual yield on new investments fluctuated accordingly  at in  in  and in we believe that because of the long term  fixed rate characteristics of our policy liabilities  even acquisitions with lives in excess of years are appropriate for us when matching assets and liabilities 
new cash flow available to us for investment was affected by issuer calls as a result of the low interest environment experienced during the past three years 
issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they can refinance them at a lower cost 
calls increase funds available for investment  but they negatively affect portfolio yield  as they cause us to replace higher yielding bonds with those available at lower prevailing yields 
issuer calls were million in  million in  and million in as long as the yields on new fixed maturity acquisitions remain below the overall portfolio yield  the portfolio yield should slowly decline 
accordingly  the portfolio yield has continued to decline in each successive year 
however  in  the effective annual yield on new acquisitions did turn up after several years of declines  rising to  and having somewhat of a stabilizing effect on the downward trend of the portfolio yield 
as discussed above  because of the sizeable annual cash flow generated from operations  we believe torchmark will be well positioned if and when investment interest rates rebound 

table of contents portfolio analysis

table of contents credit risk sensitivity 
credit risk is the level of certainty that a security s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity 
in weak economic periods  the securities of industry sectors affected by the economic downturn suffer increased credit risk 
as a result  securities in these weakened sectors could be downgraded by credit rating agencies to below investment grade status 
thus  the likelihood the issuers will honor their securities terms is reduced and the securities market values can be negatively impacted 
as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities  credit risk is a concern 
we mitigate this ongoing risk  in part  by acquiring investment grade bonds  and by investigating the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer 
we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis 
at december   approximately of invested assets at fair value were held in fixed maturity securities 
the major rating agencies considered of this portfolio to be investment grade 
the average quality rating of the portfolio is a 
the table below demonstrates the credit rankings of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio at fair value as of december rating amounts in millions aaa aa a bbb bb b less than b not rated our current investment policy is to acquire only investment grade obligations 
thus  any increases in below investment grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 
we additionally reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors 
the following table presents the industry sectors that equaled or exceeded of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio at fair value at december  industry insurance carriers depository institutions electric  gas  sanitation services nondepository credit institutions finance communications chemicals allied products media food kindred products oil gas extraction transportation equipment petroleum refining related industries security commodity brokers otherwise  no individual industry represented or more of torchmark s corporate fixed maturities 
market risk sensitivity 
the primary market risk to which torchmark s financial securities are exposed is interest rate risk  meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
since the portfolio is comprised of fixed maturity investments  it is highly subject to market risk 
declines in market interest rates in recent years have generally resulted in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio 
however  we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity 
our strategy would be the same should 
table of contents markets reverse and market rates increase placing the fixed income portfolio in an unrealized loss position 
the long term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio 
the increase in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to declines in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio 
however  in accordance with gaap  these liabilities are not marked to market 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the data are prepared through a model which incorporates various assumptions and estimates to measure the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options  put options  and unscheduled repayments could have on the portfolio  given the changes in rates 
the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in basis points at december  at december  realized gains and losses 
as a group of life and health insurance carriers  we collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits  sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future 
in addition to the payment of these benefits  we also incur acquisition costs  administrative expenses  and taxes as a part of insurance operations 
because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods  premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations 
for this reason  we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations 
this portfolio consists primarily of high quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long term insurance product obligations 
as a result  fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities 
expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 
because our investment portfolio is large and diverse  investments are occasionally sold or called  resulting in a realized gain or loss 
these gains and losses occur only incidentally  usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers 
investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments 
we do not engage in trading investments for profit 
therefore  gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield  or which result from events that are beyond our control  are only secondary to the core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 
unlike investment income  realized gains and losses are not considered in determining premium rates or product profitability of our insurance products 
realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations  however  and as a result  have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period to period trends of net income to not be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations 
accordingly  they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations 
for these reasons  we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results 

table of contents the following table summarizes our tax effected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the three year period ended december  analysis of after tax realized gains losses amounts in thousands  except for per share data year ended december  amount per share amount per share amount per share realized gains losses  net of tax  from investment sales and calls loss on redemption of debt writedown of fixed maturities writedown of other investments valuation of interest rate swaps spread on interest rate swaps total the reduction in interest cost from swapping fixed rate obligations to floating rate 
in  we wrote down certain holdings to estimated fair value as a result of other than temporary impairment 
the impaired securities met some or all of our criteria for other than temporary impairment as discussed in note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our critical accounting policies in this report 
the pretax charge for this impairment was million 
a previously written down bond of issuer was still held at december  at a fair value of million and a recorded book value of million 
as discussed in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we redeemed our trust preferred securities in  recording a pretax loss of million million after tax 
additionally in  we repurchased with the intent to retire million principal amount of our notes  recording a pretax loss of thousand thousand after tax 
in prior years  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  swapping our fixed rate commitments on our long term debt for floating rate commitments 
accounting rules require us to value our interest rate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period 
the fair values of these instruments fluctuate with interest rates in financial markets and diminish with the passage of time so that their value will be zero when they ultimately expire 
these period to period fluctuations can be substantial 
however  we do not consider these period to period fluctuations in value in managing ongoing operations because their cumulative result will be zero if we elect to hold them to expiration 
these temporary unrealized changes in swap values are included as a component of realized investment gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
this fair value adjustment for all swaps on an after tax basis was a negative million in  compared with a negative million in both and in prior periods  a steeper yield curve provided us with a considerable spread between long and short term rates on our interest rate swaps  significantly reducing the interest cost of our long term debt 
in recent periods however  as short term rates have increased with no meaningful change in long term rates  these swaps have become less profitable 
because the outlook for short term rate increases in late and the expectation of even greater short term rate increases in could have caused these spreads to become unprofitable in the future  we sold two of our swaps in the third quarter of and the remaining two swaps in the second quarter of the sales consisted of the million notional amount related to the senior debentures and the million notional amount associated with the notes 
proceeds of thousand were received on the sales 
the two remaining swaps sold in consisted of the million notional amount related to the senior notes and the million notional amount in connection with the trust preferred securities 
the sales resulted in net proceeds of thousand 
no gain or loss was recorded at the time of the swap sales 
table of contents because the gains and losses were already reflected in the financial statements as a result of the periodic revaluation discussed above 
more information on our swaps is found in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission s accounting guidance currently requires that all income and expenses related to a nonhedged derivative be recorded in the same line item on the income statement that the adjustment to fair value is recorded 
therefore  we combined the cash settlements on nonhedged swaps with the noncash unrealized fair value adjustment as a component of realized investment gains and losses 
additionally  we included the cash settlements on hedged swap derivatives in realized investment gains and losses for consistency 
our pretax interest cost reduction from these cash settlements included in realized investment gains was a positive thousand in  a positive million in  and a positive million in we reduced interest cost for this benefit in our segment analysis  because the segment analysis is required by gaap to be as management evaluates the performance of the segment 
we view the benefit from lower interest rates as a reduction in financing costs in the investment segment 

table of contents financial condition liquidity 
liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
our liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations  a portfolio of marketable securities  and a line of credit facility 
our insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs 
sources of cash flows from operations include primarily premium and investment income 
cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments  commissions  administrative expenses  and taxes 
operating cash inflows significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers  such as torchmark  expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods  sometimes many years later 
a liability is actuarially computed and recorded for these future benefits which increases as insurance in force grows so that we can save for these future payments 
earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period  but there is no corresponding cash outlay 
therefore  cash provided from operations is generally expected to significantly exceed net income in any given period 
cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of the investment portfolio 
cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements 
available cash flows are also used to repay debt  to buy back torchmark shares  to pay shareholder dividends  and for other corporate uses 
while our cash flows have historically been positive and very strong  a material reduction in cash flow could negatively affect our liquidity 
cash flows provided from operations increased in each of the three years ended december  over their respective prior year 
they were million in  million in  and million in in addition  we received million in investment maturities  repayments  and calls in  adding to available cash flows 
such repayments were million in and million in we have in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand by letters of credit up to million 
for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility  see the commercial paper section of note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our cash and short term investments were million at year end and million at year end additionally  we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need 
these securities had a fair value of billion at december  however  our strong cash flows from operations  investment maturities  and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries  see the restrictions section of note shareholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as fully described and discussed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt  torchmark had outstanding million par amount trust preferred securities at december  and million par amount trust preferred securities a year earlier 
the capital trusts liable for these securities are the legal entities which are responsible for the securities and facilitate the payment of dividends to shareholders 
they are off balance sheet arrangements which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules 
deconsolidation is required by accounting rules because they are considered to be variable interest entities in which we have no variable interest 
therefore torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity  even though we own all of the entity s voting equity and have guaranteed the entity s performance 
while these liabilities are not on our balance sheet  they are represented by torchmark s and junior subordinated debentures due to the trusts 
these junior subordinated debentures were a torchmark liability of million par and book value at december  and million par and book value at december  these securities are 
table of contents indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption capital resources in this report 
the preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our interest payment on our debt to the trusts 
as described in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trusts to meet their financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 
pension obligations to our employees primarily are obligations of trust fund entities which are not reflected on our balance sheet 
the obligations of these trusts are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans 
these trust entities hold assets which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the pension obligations as they become due 
the difference in our pension obligations and the fair value of the assets which fund those obligations are included on our balance sheet as of december  during  our subsidiary american income entered into an agreement to guarantee certain personal loans of american income employees and agents with first command bank 
first command bank is a subsidiary of first command financial services  inc first command of which lamar c 
smith is chairman and ceo 
he is also a director of torchmark 
at december   the balance subject to this guarantee was thousand 
these guarantees are secured by vested commissions due the employees and agents 
see note related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on this guarantee 
as of december   we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities other than as described above 
all of our guarantees  other than the trust preferred guarantee and the first command bank guarantee  were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries  as disclosed in note commitments and contingencies 
all of our derivative instruments  if any  were recorded at fair value on our balance sheets 
the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december  amounts in millions actual liability total payments less than one year one to three years four to five years more than five years fixed and determinable long term debt principal long term debt interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations pension obligations future insurance obligations total interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations 
pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are offset by invested assets funding the trusts 
therefore  our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on torchmark s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   these pension obligations were million  but there were also assets of million in the pension entities 
the schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations  except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted 
please refer to note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on pension obligations 
future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force and separate account obligations at december  these estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown 
management believes that the assets supporting the liability of billion at december   along with future premiums and investment income  will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations 

table of contents capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of short term debt the commercial paper facility described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term funded debt  junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities  and shareholders equity 
the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark s capital trusts which are liable for its trust preferred securities 
in accordance with gaap  these instruments are included in due to affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets 
a complete analysis and description of long term debt issues outstanding is presented in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
during the second quarter of  we registered and issued two new security offerings our trust preferred securities  offered through torchmark capital trust iii at a redemption value of million less issue expenses  and our senior notes issued for the principal amount of million less issue expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  we redeemed our trust preferred securities and we repaid our senior notes which matured 
the trust preferreds were redeemed for million plus accrued dividends and our senior notes were repaid in the principal amount of million plus accrued interest 
specific information about the new securities offered in  including the uses of proceeds  as well as information concerning securities repaid in  including funding  is disclosed and discussed in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
over the past several years  we have entered into swap agreements to exchange the fixed rate commitments on our funded debt for floating rate commitments 
during the low interest rate environment in recent years  these swaps were very beneficial in reducing our interest cost  as discussed under the captions investments excess investment income and realized gains and losses in this report 
as short term rates rose over the past two years with no meaningful change in long term rates  these swaps became less profitable 
because we believed that the swap settlements could have possibly turned negative  we disposed of these agreements during the past two years and held no swap agreements as of december  detailed information about the history of our swaps for the past three years is found in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption interest rate swaps 
in the second quarter of  we executed a voluntary stock option exercise and restoration program in which directors  employees and consultants exercised vested options in torchmark s common stock and received a lesser number of new options at the current market price 
as a result  we issued million new shares to the participants 
however  a substantial number of the new shares were immediately sold through the open market by the participants to cover the option exercise price of their new shares and their related income taxes 
as a result of the program  management s ownership in torchmark increased and the company received a significant tax benefit from the exercise of the options 
we received million in proceeds for the exercise price and million in tax benefits  both of which added to shareholder s equity 
however  as previously mentioned  we generally use the proceeds of option exercises to repurchase shares on the open market to reduce the dilution caused by option exercises 
as a result  the total impact on shareholder s equity and cash flow from the transaction was immaterial 
more information on stock options and this program is found in note significant accounting policies and in note stock based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as previously mentioned  our board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the stock repurchase program in july  in amounts and timing that management  in consultation with the board  determined to be in the best interest of the company 
we have repurchased common stock every year since  except for  the year following the acquisition of american income 
since the beginning of  we have repurchased million shares at a total cost of billion  and have acquired no fewer than million shares in any one year 
we believe that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings  return on equity  and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value 
as noted earlier in this report  we acquired million shares at a cost of million in with excess cash flow 
if the million free cash flow used for the repurchase of our common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds  an estimated million of additional investment income  after tax  would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have increased to 
because share purchases were made  actual net income per share was  an increase of 
we intend to continue the repurchase of our common shares when prices are favorable 

table of contents we maintain a significant available for sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders liabilities 
accounting rule sfas requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period 
the period to period changes in fair value  net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax  are reflected directly in shareholders equity 
changes in the fair value of the portfolio result from changes in interest rates in financial markets 
while sfas requires invested assets to be revalued  accounting rules do not permit interest bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner 
due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to its shareholders equity  this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact in the reported value of shareholders equity 
if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets  the effect on equity would be largely offset 
fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period to period presentation of our shareholders equity  capital structure  and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets 
for this reason  our management  credit rating agencies  lenders  many industry analysts  and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of sfas when analyzing our balance sheet  capital structure  and financial ratios

other items litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
additionally  it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi  a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts 
bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in 
table of contents any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation 
based upon information presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material 
for more information concerning litigation  please refer to note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

internal replacements in september  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop 
sop provides accounting guidance for deferred policy acquisition costs associated with internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those already described in sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
sop defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits  features  rights or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract  or by amendment  endorsement or rider to a contract  or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract 
under sop  modifications that result in a substantially unchanged contract will be accounted for as a continuation of the replaced contract 
modifications to a replacement contract that substantially change the contract will be accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced contract resulting in a release of unamortized deferred acquisition cost  unearned revenue  and deferred sales inducements associated with the replaced contract 
the provisions of sop are effective for torchmark for internal replacements occurring after december  we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption 
at this time  we do not expect sop to have a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies future policy benefits 
because of the long term nature of insurance contracts  our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future 
the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry 
the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
while management and company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits  there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents our ultimate obligation 
additionally  because of the size of this liability  significantly different assumptions could have resulted in materially different reported amounts 
a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased 
the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset 
deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales 
additionally  the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption value of insurance purchased as indicated in note deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
different assumptions with regard to deferred acquisition costs could produce materially different amounts of amortization 
for more information about accounting for deferred acquisition costs see note policy claims and other benefits payable 
this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us 
however  the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns 
factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation  the litigation environment  regulatory mandates  and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established 
changes in these estimates  if any  are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made 
we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits  including the estimate of unsubmitted claims  are the most appropriate under the circumstances 
however  there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation 
revenue recognition 
premium income from our subsidiaries insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected 
however  in accordance with gaap  revenue on limited payment contracts and universal life type contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently 
revenues on limited payment contracts are recognized over the contract period 
premium for deposit balance products  such as our annuity and interest sensitive life policies  is added to the policy account value 
the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability 
this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance  administration  surrender  and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder 
in each case  benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 
we report investment income as revenue  less investment expenses  when it is earned 
our investment activities are integral to our insurance operations 
because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future  the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested 
anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates  contract liabilities  and other product contract features 
these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on our net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in our insurance and annuity products 
for more information concerning revenue recognition  investment accounting  and interest sensitivity  please refer to note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities  investments  and market risk sensitivity in this report 

table of contents impairment of investments 
we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value  whereby fair value has declined below carrying value 
while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions  an investment is written down only when it has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary 
the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report 
while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other than temporary impairment  it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 
defined benefit pension plans 
we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full time employees 
we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees 
our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions 
in accordance with gaap  an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time 
these obligations are offset  at least in part  by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover  retirement age  the expected return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled 
these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation 
a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation 
a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation 
these assumptions are subjective in many cases and small changes in certain assumptions may cause material differences in reported results 
while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions  given the information available from company experience  economic data  independent consultants and other sources  we cannot assure that actual results will be the same as expected 
the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised  if necessary  based on more current information available to us 
our discount rate  rate of return on assets  and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and discussed in note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this note also contains information about pension plan assets  investment policies  funded status  and other related data
