item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sales for the fourth quarter of were up a strong from the prior year  reaching a record of  particularly encouraging was the strong growth in north america  which had its best performance in two years  up from the prior year comparable period 
lower gross margins were the result of manufacturing variances caused partially by the lingering effects the rohs legislation  which mandated that we convert our products to comply with the rohs legislation by its mid deadline the rohs conversion 
variances also resulted from three facility moves during the quarter  as we opened a new supplies converting operation in texas and moved into larger converting facilities in wisconsin and california  all of which increased manufacturing capacity 
higher operating expenses resulting from the swecoin acquisition  consulting expenses  the costs of radio certifications  advertising costs  and increases to bad debt reserves reduced operating margins 
fourth quarter operating expenses also include a reserve for an insurance receivable 
sales for the full year increased by over  with north american growth holding in the mid single digits until the fourth quarter 
international sales  particularly in europe  were stronger and generally more consistent throughout most of the year 
gross margin was down from by points with first half results being affected by mix and pricing and second half by manufacturing variances which were  in part  the result of the rohs conversion previously mentioned 
the company continued to add sales and marketing staff to support its sales growth with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
in addition  we settled a large patent litigation in the third quarter and reserved for an insurance receivable in the fourth quarter 
the combined impact of these two events was approximately  of expense

these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable  based upon the information available 
our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements 
the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra s reported financial results 
revenue recognition product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits  delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer  which happens at the point of shipment provided that no significant obligations remain  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
other items that affect our revenue recognition include customer returns customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
historically  our product returns have not been significant 
however  if a significant issue should arise  it could have a material impact on our financial statements 
growth rebates some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year 
these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
each quarter  we estimate the amount of outstanding growth rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history 
historically  actual growth rebates have been in line with our estimates 
price protection some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve  which is charged against revenue 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under theses plans have been minimal 
software revenue we sell three types of software and record revenue as follows our printers contain embedded firmware  which is part of the hardware purchase 
we consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it 
we sell a limited amount of prepackaged  or off the shelf  software for the creation of bar code labels using our printers 
there is no customization required to use this software  and we have no post shipment obligations on the software 
revenue is recognized at the time this prepackaged software is shipped 
we sometimes provide custom software as part of a printer installation project 
we bill custom software development services separate from the related hardware 
revenue related to custom software is recognized once the custom software development services have been completed and accepted by the customer 
shipping and handling we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items 
the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships 
any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 
from time to time  zebra will enter into sales transactions that include more than one product type 
this bundle of products might include printers  current or future supplies  and services 
when this type of transaction occurs  we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products 
the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the earning process for that product is fully met 
investments and marketable securities investments and marketable securities at december   consisted of us government securities  state and municipal bonds  corporate bonds  and partnership interests 
we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale except for partnership interests described below 
trading and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums 
unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
as of december   zebra s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available for sale 
in addition  as of december   all of our investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than one year are classified as long term in the balance sheet due to our ability to hold them until maturity 
all investments in marketable securities except the partnership interests are classified as available for sale securities 
we account for the partnership interests using the cost method until our ownership percentage reaches of the total partnership portfolio value 
at that time  we begin using the equity method to account for the partnership 
during  we reached the threshold on one of our partnership interests 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  and an active collection effort by regional credit functions  reporting directly to the corporate financial officers 
we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
over the last three years  accounts and notes receivable reserves varied from to of total accounts receivable 
accounts receivable reserves as of december   were  or of the balance due 
included in the accounts receivable reserve is  related to the reseller noted in the following paragraph 
in addition  other assets include an additional reserve of  related to this reseller 
we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december  while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
during  a zebra reseller filed for bankruptcy protection in austria 
at the time of the filing  the reseller owed various zebra subsidiaries a total of  the entire balance due to zebra is guaranteed by condor insurance  a nevis insurance company through a united kingdom insurance broker 
during june  zebra initiated a suit in the uk courts to enforce the guarantee 
however  during the fourth quarter  we discovered that the insurance company s financial position was such that it may not be able to pay the judgment awarded to us 
we have reviewed the situation and determined that a loss is probable  and have  therefore  reserved of the balance due  which is now  however  we are continuing to take legal action to collect the judgment against the insurance company and reduce zebra s loss 
if zebra is able to recover some or all of the loss  we will reverse the reserve and record a gain at that time 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first in  first out fifo method  or the current estimated market value 
we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
over the last three years  our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from to of gross inventory 
as of december   reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were  or of gross inventory 
we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december  at the end of december  inventory levels are high in comparison to historical balances due to rohs conversion issues and other operational issues 
zebra believes that the inventory balances need to be reduced significantly and is implementing plans to do so within the next year 
an insufficient reduction in these inventory balances could result in increased inventory obsolescence expenses 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our last assessment during june at that time  no adjustment to goodwill was necessary due to impairment 
we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in zebra s stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred  we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to  as of december  contingencies we record estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes 
quarterly  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
for a discussion of all current litigation matters  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form k 
stock based compensation as of december   zebra had two stock based compensation plans available for future grants

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio 
as stated in our written investment policy  the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 
zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers  investment liquidity  and broad diversification across investment strategies  and which limits the types of investments that may be made 
moreover  the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 
the following table sets forth the impact of a one percentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra s investment portfolio in thousands  except per share data 
as of december  interest rate sensitive instruments percentage point movement effect on pretax income effect on diluted eps after tax percentage point movement effect on pretax income effect on diluted eps after tax because these securities are classified as available for sale under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the impact of a one percentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 
foreign exchange risk we conduct business in approximately countries throughout the world and  therefore  are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates 
we generally invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable 
we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies 
we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further discussions of hedging activities

these investment funds use a variety of investment strategies  some of which involve the use of equity securities 
by policy  management limits the amount of zebra s investments in alternative investment strategies to a maximum of of the total investment portfolio  with no single investment exceeding  zebra utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate  foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments
