item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop  manufacture and sell miniaturized electronic products for defense  security and commercial applications 
we also perform customer funded contract research and development related to these products  mostly for us government agencies or prime contractors 
most of our historical business relates to application of our proprietary technologies for stacking either packaged or unpackaged semiconductors into more compact three dimensional forms  which we believe offer volume  power  weight and operational advantages over competing packaging approaches 
in december  we completed the initial acquisition from timothy looney of of the outstanding capital stock of optex  a privately held manufacturer of telescopes  periscopes  lenses and other optical systems and instruments largely for use on military vehicles 
in connection with the initial acquisition  we were granted the buyer option to purchase the remaining shares of optex from mr 
looney 
in december  we amended certain of our agreements with mr 
looney regarding the buyer option 
in consideration for such amendments  we issued a one year unsecured subordinated promissory note to mr 
looney in the original principal amount of  bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
we exercised the buyer option on december  and issued mr 
looney  shares of our common stock and a  note payable for the purchase of the remaining of the outstanding common stock of optex held by him 
as a result of the initial acquisition and exercise of the buyer option  optex is now our wholly owned subsidiary 
except for fiscal years through when we generated significant commercial product sales of wireless infrared transceivers through a subsidiary  and prior to our initial acquisition of optex  we have historically derived a substantial majority of our total revenues from government funded research and development rather than from product sales 
optex has also historically derived most of its revenues from product sales to government agencies or prime contractors 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of our total revenues will continue to be derived from government funded sources in fiscal prior to fiscal  with a few exceptions  our government funded research and development contracts were largely early stage in nature and relatively modest in size 
accordingly  our revenues from this source were not significantly affected by changes in the us defense budget 
in fiscal  we received several contract awards that we believe may eventually have the potential to lead to government production contracts  which we believe could be both larger and more profitable than government funded research and development contracts 
as a result  our contract research and development revenues improved to a substantial degree in fiscal due to procurement delays in contracts eventually received late in fiscal  our contract research and development revenues for fiscal did not reach the levels achieved in fiscal however  the contribution to our contract research and development revenue from contract awards that we believe have the potential to lead to government production contracts continued at an increased level in fiscal from that achieved in years prior to fiscal our current marketing efforts are focused on government programs that we believe have the potential to substantially sustain this focus on opportunities with the possibility of transition to government production contracts 
because of this focus and our acquisition of optex  our future revenues may become more dependent upon us defense budgets  funding approvals and political agendas for the foreseeable future 
we are also attempting to increase our revenues from product sales by introducing new products with commercial applications  in particular  miniaturized cameras and stacked computer memory chips 
we are currently transitioning into a new generation of such products  with a view to increasing our product sales  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete development  successfully launch or profitably manufacture and sell any such products on a timely basis  if at all 
we generally use contract manufacturers to produce these products  and all of our other current operations  except those of optex  occur at a single  leased facility in costa mesa  california 
optex manufactures its products at a leased facility in richardson  texas 
we have a history of unprofitable operations largely as a result of discretionary investments that we have made to commercialize our technologies and to maintain our technical staff and corporate infrastructure at levels that we believe are required for future growth 
our investments to commercialize our technologies have yet to produce sustainable profitable product sales 
with respect to our investments in staff and infrastructure  the advanced technical and multi disciplinary content of our proprietary technologies places a premium on a stable and well trained work force 
as a result  we tend to maintain our work force even when anticipated government contracts are delayed  a circumstance that occurs with some frequency and that results in under utilization of our labor force for revenue generation 
we believe that this pattern can be overcome by the achievement of greater contract backlog and are seeking growth in our research and development contract revenue to that end 
to date  however  we have not yet achieved the level of sustained revenue required to predictably produce profitable operations 
our ability to recover our investments through the cost reimbursement features of our government contracts are subject to both regulatory and competitive pricing considerations 

table of contents in the past  we have maintained separate operating business units  including our subsidiaries  which were separately managed  with independent product development  marketing and distribution capabilities 
however  during fiscal  we consolidated all of our operations to more effectively use our administrative  marketing and engineering resources and to reduce expenses 
other than optex  none of our subsidiaries presently account for more than of our total revenues or total assets  and none have separate employees or facilities 
optex accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal  even though it was only part of our consolidated group for three fiscal quarters 
we expect that optex will to continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenues in subsequent reporting periods 
since fiscal  we have reported our operating results and financial condition segmented only between our research and development business and our product business 
optex accounted for approximately of our total product sales in fiscal we have reclassified our operating results and financial condition for prior fiscal years to conform to this presentation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included at the end of this report 
fiscal included weeks  a longer fiscal year duration that is generally repeated once every six years 
in fiscal  we discontinued operations of our novalog subsidiary 
all financial statements and schedules of isc give effect to this discontinuation and report novalog as a discontinued operation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included at the end of this report 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
as such  management is required to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant accounting policies that are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
our consolidated total revenues during fiscal included a substantial contribution from contracts to develop prototypes and provide research  development  design  testing and evaluation of complex detection and control defense systems 
our research and development contracts are usually cost reimbursement plus a fixed fee or fixed price with billing entitlements based on the level of effort we expended 
for such research and development contracts  we recognize revenues as we incur costs and include applicable fees or profits primarily in the proportion that costs incurred bear to estimated final costs 
upon the initiation of each such contract  a detailed cost budget is established for direct labor  material  subcontract support and allowable indirect costs based on our proposal and the required scope of the contract as may have been modified by negotiation with the customer  usually a us government agency or prime contractor 
a program manager is assigned to secure the needed labor  material and subcontract in the program budget to achieve the stated goals of the contract and to manage the deployment of those resources against the program plan 
our accounting department collects the direct labor  material and subcontract charges for each contract on a weekly basis and provides such information to the respective program managers and senior management 
the program managers review and report the performance of their contracts against the respective program plans with our senior management  including our chief executive officer  on a monthly basis 
these reviews are summarized in the form of estimates of costs to complete the contracts etcs 
if an etc indicates a potential overrun against budgeted program resources  it is the responsibility of the program manager to revise the program plan in a manner consistent with the customer s objectives to eliminate such overrun and to seek necessary customer agreement to such revision 
to mitigate the financial risk of such re planning  we attempt to negotiate the deliverable requirements of our research and development contracts to allow as much flexibility as possible in technical outcomes 
given the inherent technical uncertainty involved in research and development contracts  in which new technology is being invented  explored or enhanced  such flexibility in terms is frequently achievable 
when re planning does not appear possible within program budgets  senior management makes a judgment as to whether we plan to supplement the customer budget with our own funds or whether the program statement of work will require the additional resources to be expended to meet contractual obligations 
if either determination is made  we record an accrual for the anticipated contract overrun based on the most recent etc of the particular contract 
we provide for anticipated losses on contracts by recording a charge to income during the period in which a potential for loss is first identified 
we adjust the accrual for contract losses quarterly based on the review of outstanding contracts 
upon completion of a contract  we reduce any associated accrual of anticipated loss on such contract as the previously recorded obligations are satisfied 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings under government contracts are accounted for as unbilled revenues on uncompleted contracts and are stated at estimated realizable value 
we consider many factors when applying gaap related to revenue recognition 
these factors generally include  but are not limited to 
table of contents the actual contractual terms  such as payment terms  delivery dates  and pricing terms of the various product and service elements of a contract  time period over which services are to be performed  costs incurred to date  total estimated costs of the project  anticipated losses on contracts  and collectibility of the revenues 
we analyze each of the relevant factors to determine its impact  individually and collectively with other factors  on the revenue to be recognized for any particular contract with a customer 
management is required to make judgments regarding the significance of each factor in applying the revenue recognition standards  as well as whether or not each factor complies with such standards 
any misjudgment or error by management in its evaluation of the factors and the application of the standards could have a material adverse affect on our future operating results 
we recognize revenue from product sales  both from our operations in costa mesa  california and at optex  upon shipment  provided that the following conditions are met there are no unfulfilled contingencies associated with the sale  we have a sales contract or purchase order with the customer  and we are reasonably assured that the sales price can be collected 
the absence of any of these conditions  including the lack of shipment  would cause revenue recognition to be deferred 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
each quarter  we evaluate our inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
we write off inventories that are considered obsolete and adjust remaining inventory balances to approximate the lower of cost or market value 
the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market requires us to estimate the amounts of current inventories that will be sold 
these estimates are dependent on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers 
costs on long term contracts and programs in progress generally represent recoverable costs incurred 
the marketing of our research and development contracts involves the identification and pursuit of contracts under specific government budgets and programs 
we are frequently involved in the pursuit of a specific anticipated contract that is a follow on or related to an existing contract 
we often determine that it is probable that a subsequent award will be successfully received  particularly if continued progress can be demonstrated against anticipated technical goals of the projected new program while the government goes through its lengthy approval process required to allocate funds and award contracts 
when such a determination occurs  we capitalize material  labor and overhead costs that we expect to recover from a follow on or new contract 
due to the uncertainties associated with new or follow on research and development contracts  we maintain significant reserves for this inventory to avoid overstating its value 
we have adopted this practice because we believe that we are typically able to more fully recover such costs under the provisions of government contracts by direct billing of inventory rather than by seeking recovery of such costs through permitted indirect rates  which may be more vulnerable to competitive market pressures 
valuation allowances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets 
we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition  with any excess purchase price of net tangible and intangible assets acquired over their estimated fair value recorded as goodwill 
because of the expertise required to value intangible assets  we typically engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in determining those values 
valuation of intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  estimating future cash flows from product sales  developing appropriate discount rates  continuation of customer relationships and renewal of customer contracts  and approximating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 

table of contents we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we have elected to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
our optex subsidiary is a reporting unit within our product operating segment 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of their expected future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
for our initial annual impairment review of optex  we placed reliance on our analysis conducted with the support of an independent valuation specialist in our second fiscal quarter in connection with the initial acquisition 
we updated our impairment review of optex as of october  based on the analysis performed  we determined that the optex reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying amount at october   and therefore concluded that there was no indication of an impairment loss 
while we do not believe that any portion of our recorded goodwill is presently impaired  any future impairment of our goodwill could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
purchased intangible assets with determinable useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization  and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
from time to time  but at least annually  we review the recoverability of the carrying value of identified intangibles and other long lived assets  including fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows that we expect to result from the use of such asset and its eventual disposition 
our estimate of future cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
the actual cash flows realized from these assets may vary significantly from our estimates due to increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices  among other things 
if we determine that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the asset 
while we do not believe that any of our intangible or other long lived assets are currently impaired  any future impairment of such assets could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation 
we calculate stock option based compensation by estimating the fair value of each option using the black scholes option pricing model in accordance with sfas r 
our determination of fair value of stock option based payment awards is made as of their respective dates of grant using the option pricing model and is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of other subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the our outstanding employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer or willing seller market transaction 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the option after consideration of the estimated forfeiture rate 

table of contents we calculate compensation expense for restricted stock awards by determining the fair value of each such grant as of their respective dates of grant using the closing sales price of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market at such dates without any discount 
we recognize compensation expense for restricted stock awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the restricted stock award 
derivatives 
in june  fasb issued no 
sfas  accounting for derivatives and hedging instruments sfas 
this statement requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives are measured at fair value and marked to market through earnings  as required by sfas our determination of fair value of embedded derivatives  if any  is made as of each reporting date using option pricing models  and is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the derivative s underlying contract and the expected life of a derivative s underlying contract 
although the fair value of derivatives is determined in accordance with sfas  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer or willing seller market transaction 
comparison of fiscal years ended october  and october  contract research and development revenue 
contract research and development revenue consists of amounts realized or realizable from funded research and development contracts  largely from us government agencies and government contractors  primarily conducted by our historical operations in costa mesa  california 
contract research and development revenues for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal  but continued to be the majority source of our total revenue as shown in the following table contract research and development revenue percentage of total revenue fiscal dollar decrease in fiscal fiscal percentage decrease for fiscal we believe that the dollar decrease in contract research and development revenue for fiscal was largely the result of delays in receipt of new contracts associated with the timing of the federal budget and related procurement activities 
contract research and development revenue is projected to represent a declining percentage of our future total revenues because of the acquisition of optex  the revenues of which consist solely of product sales 
optex contributed approximately million of product sales to total revenues in fiscal  which was the primary cause for the decrease in contract research and development revenue as a percent of total revenue in the current fiscal year 
after eliminating the impact of optex on our total revenues  contract research and development would have represented of our total revenues in fiscal based on our existing backlog and notices of pending research and development contract awards  we believe  but cannot guarantee  that we will be able to increase our contract research and development revenue in absolute dollars for fiscal over that achieved in fiscal however  at the time of this report  the full potential effects of the fiscal us defense budget and relevant government procurements are not yet visible to us 
cost of contract research and development revenue 
cost of contract research and development revenue consists of wages and related benefits  as well as subcontractor  independent consultant and vendor expenses directly incurred in support of research and development contracts  plus associated indirect expenses permitted to be charged pursuant to the relevant contracts 
our cost of contract research and development revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal and its percentage of such revenue is shown in the following table cost of contract research and development revenue percentage of contract research and development revenue fiscal dollar decrease in fiscal fiscal percentage decrease for fiscal 
table of contents most of the dollar decrease in cost of contract research and development revenue in fiscal was derived from the fact that our revenues of this nature are recognized as we incur costs 
as a result  a decrease in contract research and development revenue has an associated decrease in cost of such revenue 
the increase in cost of contract research and development revenue as a percent of contract research and development revenue in fiscal was partially attributable to allocation of  of stock based compensation expense  related to stock options held by employees that charged direct labor to cost of contract research and development revenue in the current fiscal year  due to the new requirements established by sfas r  which first became effective for us at the beginning of fiscal in addition  the unusual delay in receipt of our expected new contracts caused us to increase our reserves against pre contract work in process inventory by  in fiscal  a factor that was not present in fiscal the contract delays also resulted in lower than projected total revenues for fiscal  which in turn produced higher effective overhead rates for the current fiscal year than originally projected due to the relatively fixed nature of our labor base 
our historical practice has been to adjust our indirect billing rates for cost reimbursable contracts only once or twice a year in order to provide a reasonably stable forecasting metric for both our customers and us 
in a period when our actual incurred overhead costs exceed those that we recover through our standard overhead billing rate  such as fiscal  the contribution of actual overhead expense disproportionately increases our cost of contract research and development revenue 
effective april  we adjusted our indirect billing rates for cost reimbursable contracts  and this adjustment had a beneficial effect to our recovery of costs in the balance of fiscal however  it did not fully recover all of our experienced overhead costs due to the prior conclusion or funding limits of some of our cost reimbursable contracts  which precluded additional cost recovery under such contracts 
in fiscal   increases to cost of contract research and development revenue resulting from indirect billing rates and stock based compensation expense were partially offset by a smaller percentage contribution to costs of contract research and development revenue from external vendors  independent contractors and subcontractors 
when the percentage contribution of external sources to our costs of contract research and development decreases and the percentage contribution of our internal labor to our costs of contract research and development correspondingly increases  our gross margin on our contract research and development revenue typically improves because of the greater cost reimbursement permitted for internal expenses under government cost reimbursement contracts than for external costs of vendors  independent contractors and subcontractors 
however  in fiscal  this improvement was not sufficient to offset the opposite effects of stock based compensation expense and higher overhead expense discussed above 
product sales 
subsequent to the initial acquisition of optex at the end of our first quarter of fiscal  our product sales were principally comprised of sales of optex s optical equipment and systems  largely intended for use on military land vehicles 
we also derived some product sales from sales of chips  modules  stacked chip products and chip stacking services and  to a limited degree  sales of miniaturized camera products 
product sales for fiscal and fiscal are shown in the following table product sales percentage of total revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal both the absolute dollar increase and percentage increase as a percentage of total revenue for the current fiscal year were the direct result of the initial acquisition of optex on december   which contributed approximately million in product sales to fiscal based upon our preliminary analysis of existing and projected us defense budgets and the current status of us military operations  we believe that the replacement market for equipment mounted on military ground vehicles will increase  thereby setting the stage for possible growth of optex s product sales if it can sustain its market share in the future 
the aggregate increase in our product sales resulting from the consolidation of nine months of optex s revenues more than offset an approximate million decline in sales of our stacked chip products and stacking services in fiscal as compared to fiscal we attribute some of the fiscal decline in sales of stacked chip products to our current emphasis on such products that include the value of the stacked memory chips themselves  as opposed to sales of stacking 
table of contents services  which involve the stacking of customer consigned memory chips  the value of which are not reflected in the resulting sales 
we believe that some of our customers in fiscal have elected to take the risk of purchasing memory chips for stacking and consigning them to our competitors for stacking in order to reduce costs  thus negatively impacting our sales 
furthermore  we believe that demand for stacked chips in tsops  which has been the industry standard for chip packages for over a decade  is mature  at best  and possibly is currently in decline 
in fiscal  we announced qualification of a process for converting tsops into stacks with bga attachments  which we believe can address emerging demand for stacked chip assemblies using more space efficient attachment technology 
the aggregate increase in product sales in fiscal resulting from the consolidation of nine months of optex s revenues also offset a decline in thermal viewer product sales in the current year resulting from the procurement mechanisms used by customers 
in fiscal  approximately of our product sales were derived from a single initial product shipment of our first generation thermal viewer product 
this product was substantially improved later in fiscal  and we starting shipping limited quantities of our improved thermal viewer late in fiscal  continuing into fiscal however  in contrast to the sales in fiscal  sales of the second generation thermal viewer product have largely been procured through our research and development contracts as a convenience requested by the procuring agencies 
as a result  such sales are reflected in our contract research and development revenue in fiscal  rather than in product sales 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales consists of wages and related benefits  subcontractor  independent consultant and vendor expenses directly incurred in the manufacture of products sold  plus related overhead expenses 
our cost of product sales for fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table cost of product sales percentage of product sales fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal the absolute dollar increase in our cost of product sales in fiscal was primarily due to the optex transaction discussed above  which resulted in the consolidation of both optex s product sales and its cost of such product sales 
the costs of product sales also included  of amortized intangible expenses derived from the purchase price allocation of the initial acquisition of optex 
in addition  we allocated  of the purchase price to optex s finished goods inventory at the time of the initial acquisition  which further increased cost of product sales in fiscal this latter allocation was fully charged to cost of product sales in fiscal and will not effect future fiscal periods 
these acquisition related expenses offset some improvements in cost of product sales of our stacked chip products in fiscal  resulting in an aggregate increase in the cost of product sales as a percent of total product sales from fiscal general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense largely consists of wages and related benefits for our executive  financial  administrative and marketing team  as well as professional fees  primarily legal and accounting fees and costs 
the comparison of general and administrative expense for fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table general and administrative expense percentage of total revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal the largest contribution to the dollar increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal was the increase in general and administrative service expenses  largely legal and accounting expenses  most of which were primarily related to the initial acquisition of optex  but also included increased consulting expenses payable to a director related to business development 
these factors accounted for approximately million  or  of the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal we anticipate that legal  accounting and consulting fees will continue to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal  both due to the activities related to the exercise of our optex buyer option  the negotiations regarding our debt 
table of contents refinancing and our preparation for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
increased general and administrative labor expense also accounted for approximately  or  of the increase in general and administrative expense for fiscal as compared to fiscal  largely due to the inclusion of optex s management labor expense  but also due to increased labor expenses incurred to enhance our financial staff  both in our corporate offices and at optex 
approximately  or  of the dollar increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of the shift in the deployment of certain of our technical staff to focus on our bid and proposal activities during the current year 
during fiscal  we had to adjust scheduled labor deployment to reflect the program scheduling impact of the delays in receipt of research and development contracts previously discussed 
because of identified material contract opportunities related to the fiscal defense budget  direct labor made available as a result of these delays was substantially deployed to bid and proposal activities in fiscal  rather than internal research and development expense  which has historically been the other typical deployment alternative for non revenue generating direct labor 
in fiscal  we did not deploy any resources to bid and proposal activities because of the notices of contract awards that we had already received relating to significant pending procurements 
in addition to the bid and proposal impact  general and administrative expense in fiscal was also increased by the requirement to expense stock based compensation costs associated with stock options pursuant to sfas r  a requirement that did not exist in fiscal this factor accounted for approximately  or  of the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal general and administrative expense in fiscal also included approximately  of intangible asset amortization expense as a result of the optex acquisition  a factor that was not present in fiscal and which contributed to approximately to of the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal additionally  we increased our reserve for doubtful accounts receivable by  in fiscal  and no comparable expense was incurred in fiscal we believe this increase was related to isolated circumstances related to particular customers and contracts and do not believe this increase is indicative of a trend 
in absolute dollars  we expect that our general and administrative expense is likely to continue to increase in future periods because of preparation for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and our acquisition of optex  both because of the effects of that acquisition on our corporate operations and increased expenses at optex related to the implementation of internal controls and disclosure requirements associated with being part of a publicly reporting company 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of wages and related benefits for our research and development team  independent contractor consulting fees and subcontractor and vendor expenses directly incurred in support of internally funded research and development projects  plus associated overhead expenses 
research and development expense for fiscal as compared to fiscal changed as shown in the following table research and development expense percentage of total revenue fiscal dollar decrease in fiscal fiscal percentage decrease for fiscal the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflected our deployment of our technical staff in those respective years to alternative uses  namely for customer funded research and development contracts and also for bid and proposal activities 
we use the same technical staff for both internal and customer funded research and development projects  as well as bid and proposal activities  and when one of these categories is prioritized during a period  there is less labor available and correspondingly less expense for other categories 
delays in customer funded research and development contracts extended into the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  later than comparable delays in fiscal accordingly  more direct labor was available for non contract use in fiscal than fiscal however  of that available direct labor  as discussed above  a priority was given to bid and proposal activities for the deployment of discretionary resources in fiscal this resulted in less direct labor available for internally funded research and development projects in fiscal and a corresponding reduction in research and development expense 
since most of optex s sales relate to products built to customer supplied designs  optex generally has conducted very minimal internal research and development activities and accordingly  did not incur significant research and development expense in fiscal interest expense 
our interest expense for fiscal  compared to that of fiscal  increased substantially  largely as a result of the debt service associated with the initial acquisition of optex  as shown in the following table interest expense fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase in fiscal 
table of contents we anticipate that interest expense will increase substantially in future periods as a result of amortization of discounts derived from our debt refinancing in december see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these effects 
net loss 
our net loss for fiscal  compared to that of fiscal  increased as shown in the following table net loss fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase in fiscal our contract research and development revenue for both years was insufficient to fully support our technical staff and related infrastructure 
furthermore  our product sales in those periods did not generate adequate margins to fully defray the remainder of our indirect expenses 
the increase in net loss in fiscal was substantially derived from the recurring and non recurring costs and expenses related to the initial acquisition of optex  including approximately million of cash and imputed interest on the debt we incurred to consummate and manage that acquisition  as noted above 
we believe that the non recurring acquisition related expenses  such as the legal and accounting expenses associated with the various regulatory filings and the unusual expenses associated with the annual meeting of stockholders to approve certain aspects of the acquisition of optex and related transactions  were substantially diminished by the fourth quarter of fiscal however  we were required to record a million default settlement fee at october   which was paid to pequot in connection with the subsequent refinancing of our debt in december in addition  we incurred a  expense in fiscal expense as a result of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument resulting from our amendment of the securities purchase agreement with pequot in march  which agreement was originally entered into in connection with the initial acquisition of optex 
furthermore  the delay in start of several government r d contracts in fiscal resulted in portions of those contracts being retained in backlog for fiscal in combination with other orders received early in fiscal  we believe that this increased backlog can contribute to an improvement in our operating results in fiscal  although we cannot guarantee this outcome 
as noted above  the imputed expenses associated with the refinancing of our debt are substantial and are expected to adversely impact our fiscal results 
comparison of fiscal years ended october  and october  contract research and development revenue 
contract research and development revenues for fiscal increased significantly over the comparable revenues of fiscal and continued to be the dominant source of our total revenue as shown in the following table contract research and development revenue percentage of total revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal 
table of contents our fiscal contract research and development revenue of approximately million was not only a record level of such revenue for us  but also exceeded our former total revenue record of million  inclusive of the revenues of our discontinued novalog subsidiary  in fiscal the fiscal increase of contract research and development revenue over that of fiscal followed  and was significantly greater than the increase of such revenue in fiscal over that of fiscal we believe that this pattern of increase continued to be due to the receipt of more development contracts oriented toward possible eventual production 
typically  such contracts are larger in dollar value than early stage research and development contracts 
we received several such contracts commencing in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal and other such contracts and contract add ons in subsequent periods of the fiscal year 
as a result  our contract research and development revenue increased from approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal  which was essentially a continuation of the average approximate million per quarter of such revenue in the second half of fiscal  to contract research and development revenue ranging from million to million for the subsequent quarters of fiscal based on our existing backlog and notices of pending research and development contract awards  we believe  but cannot guarantee  that we will be able to sustain this improved level of contract research and development revenue in absolute dollars for at least the initial portion of fiscal at the time of this report  the potential effects of the fiscal us defense budget and relevant government procurements on our full fiscal are not yet visible to us

our cost of contract research and development revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal and its percentage of such revenue is shown in the following table cost of contract research and development revenue percentage of contract research and development revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal most of the dollar and percentage increase in cost of contract research and development revenue in fiscal was derived from the fact that our revenues of this nature are recognized as we incur costs  and as a result  an increase in contract research development revenue has an associated increase in cost of such revenue 
the percentage increase in cost of contract research and development revenue was disproportionately higher in fiscal than the associated percentage increase in contract research and development revenue itself largely due to two factors 
first  in fiscal  the technical milestones that we had achieved in our prior development contracts and internally funded research and development allowed us to change our procedures for managing our research and development contracts to place greater emphasis on financial performance  rather than prioritizing technical objectives beyond those required by contracts in order to support our marketing for future business 
this change  in turn  allowed us to reduce our accrued reserve for potential losses on ongoing research contracts by more than  thereby reducing cost of contract research and development revenue in fiscal no such non recurring reduction of cost of contract research and development revenue occurred in fiscal the other factor that disproportionately increased our cost of contract research and development revenue in fiscal was the percentage of such costs derived from subcontractor and vendor support 
under allowable rate recovery provisions of government contracts  external subcontractor and vendor direct costs do not generate as much revenue as direct costs incurred by internal labor 
subcontractor and vendor direct costs incurred in support of contract research and development revenue were of such revenue in fiscal  but only in fiscal the higher percentage of subcontractor and vendor direct costs in fiscal were related to the large increase in contract research and development revenue in fiscal  not all of which could be generated by our internal resources and thereby contributing to the percentage increase in cost of contract research and development revenue 
product sales 
product sales for fiscal and fiscal are shown in the following table product sales percentage of total revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal the increase in our product sales for fiscal primarily reflected an increase in our sales of stacked memory products 
sales of our stacked memory products in fiscal were  an increase of  from the  of such sales in fiscal the fiscal improvement in stacked memory product sales was largely the result of a continuation of our expansion into commercial customer accounts 
product sales for fiscal also included  for the first time  a contribution from sales of our miniaturized thermal viewer and camera products 
sales of such products accounted for  or  of our product sales in fiscal 
table of contents cost of product sales 
our cost of product sales for fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table cost of product sales percentage of product sales fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal our increase in product sales in fiscal led to a corresponding increase in the cost of product sales in the same period 
however  our cost of product sales increased proportionally less in fiscal than the product sales themselves  resulting in a positive gross profit on product sales in fiscal as opposed to the negative gross profit on product sales in fiscal this margin improvement was largely due to a shift in the composition of our stacked memory product sales during the latter part of fiscal during that period  we shifted several of our commercial accounts for stacked memory products away from a consignment approach  in which customer purchased die were provided to us for stacking  to an approach in which we purchased the memory die for stacking ourselves 
our pricing for the approach in which we purchase the memory die reflects the costs and risks of providing this element of the value of our stacked memory products and results in a higher dollar gross profit on each unit of stacked memory sold 
accordingly  even though our costs of product sales of stacked memory products increased substantially because the costs of the memory die themselves were included  our dollar margins on the sales of those memory die  after stacking  increased proportionately more  thereby improving our aggregate dollar margins on product sales in fiscal general and administrative expense 
fiscal general and administrative expense increased on an absolute dollar basis  but declined as a percentage of total revenue  from fiscal as shown in the following table general and administrative expense percentage of total revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal our dollar increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal was primarily due to a  increase in general and administrative service expenses  partly due to initial implementation of the accounting requirements associated with preparation for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and partly due to increased consulting expenses payable to a director related to business development 
additionally  our general and administrative unallowable expenses for fiscal increased by  over the general and administrative unallowable expenses of fiscal  largely due to non recurring legal expenses associated with litigation with a finder that was originally scheduled for trial in september  but subsequently settled in october these increases were offset by a reduction of  of general and administrative labor and labor benefit costs and smaller reductions in various other categories of general and administrative expense in fiscal  resulting in the overall  or  increase in general and administrative expense for the fiscal year 
as a result of the much higher percentage increase in total revenue  general and administrative expense declined substantially as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal  as shown in the above table 
we expect to incur a dollar increase in our general and administrative expense in fiscal because of anticipated further increases in accounting expenses  including those associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 

table of contents research and development expense 
research and development expense in fiscal decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue from research and development expense in fiscal as shown in the following table research and development expense percentage of total revenue fiscal dollar decrease in fiscal fiscal percentage decrease for fiscal this fiscal decrease in research and development expense continued a decrease begun in fiscal primarily due to the reduced availability of our technical staff for internally funded research projects in the respective periods 
we use the same technical staff for both internally and customer funded research and development projects  and we prioritize the deployment of this labor to revenue producing projects whenever possible 
because of the substantial increase in our customer funded research and development revenue in fiscal  we had much less discretionary direct labor available for deployment to internally funded research and development projects in fiscal than in fiscal furthermore  because of the substantial progress toward technological milestones that we were able to achieve under our funded contracts in fiscal  we required less internally funded research and development activities to achieve specified goals for the period 
net loss 
primarily due to the increase in our contract research and development revenue and the increased gross profit and indirect expense absorption resulting therefrom  our net loss in fiscal was substantially reduced from the net loss of fiscal as shown in the following table net loss fiscal dollar decrease in fiscal fiscal percentage decrease in fiscal also contributing to this approximate million improvement in our net loss in fiscal was the more efficient use of our direct labor resources during that year for customer funded research and development activities 
the improved efficiency in use of direct labor was one of the consequences of the substantial increase in our funded backlog that we realized starting with the second quarter of fiscal at the beginning of that second quarter  our funded backlog was approximately million 
at the end of that second quarter  our funded backlog was approximately million 
at the end of the subsequent period  the third quarter of fiscal  our funded backlog was still approximately million  despite having realized over million in total revenue during that period 
both this size and replenishment of our funded backlog was unprecedented in our operating history and allowed us to plan our direct labor utilization over longer periods than in prior years  resulting in less allocation of labor to non revenue generating activities 
as a result  in fiscal we were able to achieve an approximate improvement in the average number of contract research and development revenue producing hours achieved by our technical staff  building on the improvement that we had achieved in fiscal we believe that further substantial improvement in the revenue production efficiency of our technical staff will be difficult at our current level and skill mix  and that any additional growth in our contract research and development revenue  if achievable  will likely require a corresponding increase in our technical staff 
offsetting our improvement in net loss resulting from increased revenue and labor efficiency were several non operating or non recurring factors that impacted fiscal  but that did not have a comparable effect in fiscal our decision to discontinue novalog s operations late in fiscal resulted in  of losses due to abandonment of assets in fiscal  an element of net loss that did not occur in fiscal litigation that we settled in october to eliminate possible future expenses resulted in  of settlement expense and approximately  of legal expense in fiscal of a non recurring nature 
we did  however  reduce our interest expense in fiscal by  from the interest expense of fiscal largely due to our positive cash flow from operations in fiscal the net loss is net of the allocation of a portion of the loss from operations attributable to minority ownership interests of consolidated subsidiaries 
in fiscal  the consolidated amount of minority interest loss allocation was  all of which was attributable to novalog 
this minority loss allocation was  less than the aggregate  allocated minority interest of fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our liquidity  in terms of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents  was lower at october   the end of fiscal  as compared to our liquidity at october   the end of fiscal  while our working capital was substantially higher over that same period as shown in the following table cash and cash equivalents working capital october  dollar change in fiscal october  the liquidity changes during fiscal reflected the financing and acquired working capital related to the initial acquisition of optex  the delays in receipt of expected research and development contracts and the known effects of the december refinancing of the company s debt  which were required to be recorded effective october  the total net proceeds from the convertible debt  the bank term loan and the revolving line of credit secured in connection with the initial acquisition in december was approximately million 
we used approximately million of these net proceeds to purchase of the capital stock of optex and pay the related expenses 
the remaining million of the initial acquisition net proceeds constituted a substantial contribution to cash and working capital for fiscal and was the principal cause for the increase in working capital for the year 
however  the cash timing impact of delays in receipt of research and development contracts and the substantial additional expenses derived from  and as a follow up to  the initial acquisition substantially offset the financing proceeds  contributing to the  decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal a more significant contributor to the decline in cash in fiscal was the approximate million of cash we used for investment other than the initial acquisition of optex  approximately million of which was for property improvement and equipment purchases  with the balance used for acquisition of patents 
despite our approximate million loss from operations  our cash flow from operations during fiscal was a slightly positive  this outcome was largely due to approximately million of non cash expenses incurred in the aggregate during the period  consisting of approximately million of depreciation and amortization  of which was intangible amortization expense resulting from the initial acquisition of optex  approximately million of common stock contributions to employee retirement plans   of inventory write downs   of imputed interest expense   of stock based compensation expense   of imputed expense derived from the change in fair value of the derivative instrument embedded in our security purchase agreement with pequot  and  of operating expense paid in common stock 
the most substantial timing effect that improved cash flow from operations was an approximately million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we believe this outcome was largely the effect of the extension of our payments  rather than indicative of a fundamental trend 
an additional substantial timing effect was the million settlement fee payable to pequot recorded at october  that was not paid until the refinancing of our debt was completed in december secondary timing effects that improved cash flow from operations included a  increase in deferred revenue  a  increase in advance billings on uncompleted contracts and a  decrease in unbilled revenues on contracts 
these secondary effects were largely related to contractual milestones and billing cycles  rather than being indicative of trends 
substantial timing effects in fiscal that decreased cash flow from operations over a relatively short term included a  increase in accounts receivable and a  increase in inventory 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of conventional operating leases 
as of october  and october   we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments debt 
at october   we had approximately million of debt  which was incurred to finance the initial acquisition and related working capital needs and which consisted of i subordinated convertible notes collectively  the notes issued in two series to pequot in the original aggregate principal amount of million  ii the principal balance then outstanding of our variable rate term loan with our senior bank of approximately million and iii our million revolving line of credit  all net of recorded discounts of approximately million 
the term loan was in the original principal amount of million and bore interest at the prime rate plus a varying percentage between and based upon a debt service coverage ratio 
the term loan was payable in equal monthly installments commencing january   but was subject to acceleration at the option of the bank upon the occurrence of certain events of default 
as of october   we were under notice from the bank that we were not in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio and profitability requirements of the term loan 
in december  subsequent to the close of fiscal  we negotiated and consummated a two year  million term loan from new senior lenders  which allowed us to repay our then existing senior bank debt  including our million revolving line of credit and to obtain additional working capital 
this new senior debt has an interest only debt service requirement at per annum for its term until its maturity date of december  our new senior lenders have waived our requirement to comply with financial debt service covenants  providing we satisfy our interest payment and other requirements of our new term loan  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to avoid default conditions under our new senior debt in the future 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  which interest is subject to potential reduction over time  and the principal and interest under the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price per share that was initially set at  which conversion price is subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
due to the issuance of warrants to our new senior lenders in connection with the refinancing of our senior debt in december  the conversion price per share of the notes was automatically adjusted to in accordance with the anti dilution provisions in the notes 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included at the end of this report 
we issued the first series of notes the series notes in the original principal amount of approximately million  and such series notes are repayable in quarterly interest only payments commencing march  though december  thereafter  the series notes are payable in equal monthly principal installments plus interest maturing on december  the second series of notes the series notes are in the original principal amount of approximately million and interest on such notes was initially repayable in quarterly interest only payments commencing march   with the remaining principal amount due and payable on december  upon assignment of the notes in december  the maturity date of the series notes was extended to december  we may be required to repurchase the notes under certain circumstances  including upon election of the note holders following an event of default as defined in the notes  upon the incurrence of debt other than permitted indebtedness under the notes  and upon certain issuances of our capital stock  at a repurchase price equal to the greater of the outstanding principal amount of the notes purchased  plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon through the day of payment  and of the average of the closing prices of our common stock for the five days preceding the repurchase date 
in september  pequot notified us that events of default had occurred under the notes as a result of our non compliance with the covenant of our senior bank debt  as well as other facts and circumstances that we disputed  and invoked the repurchase feature of the notes 
however  shortly after issuance of pequot s notice  our then senior lender issued a payment blockage notice to pequot regarding the note repurchase that suspended the effectiveness of the pequot event notice 
in december  the notes were assigned through purchase from pequot to our new senior lenders and any existing or asserted defaults thereunder were waived 
in connection with the original december financing  we also issued warrants to pequot the pequot warrants in two series to purchase shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which pequot warrants expire on december  the series warrants were initially exercisable for the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock  and the series warrants were initially exercisable for the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
due to the issuance of warrants to our new senior lenders  in december  pursuant to their terms  the series i warrants were automatically adjusted to become exercisable for the purchase of up to  shares at per share  and the series warrants were automatically adjusted to become exercisable for the purchase of up to  shares at per share 
subsequent to this adjustment  upon the exercise of any warrants after the issuance of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock as adjusted for any stock splits  stock combinations or similar events  we may either i deliver the applicable shares of common stock  or ii pay to pequot an amount equal to the black scholes value of the pequot warrants with respect to the portion exercised in excess of  shares subject to adjustments mentioned above 
the portion of the warrants with respect to which the cash amount has been paid will be cancelled and retired 
as a result of stockholder approval  both the series warrants and series warrants are currently fully exercisable 
see notes   and to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the optex initial acquisition and the related financings and bank debt 

table of contents on december   we amended certain of the agreements with timothy looney regarding our buyer option 
in consideration for such amendments  we issued a one year unsecured subordinated promissory note to mr 
looney in the principal amount of  bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
in january  we negotiated an amendment to our earnout agreement with mr 
looney that extended his earnout period to december and reduced the aggregate maximum earnout to million in consideration for a subordinated secured term loan providing for advances up to million  bearing interest per annum  provided by mr 
looney to optex  which term loan matures on the earlier of february or sixty days after retirement of our senior debt 
debt default waivers 
as a result of our failure to timely file our form k for the fiscal year ended october  and the resulting receipt of a nasdaq staff determination concerning such late filing  our series and series notes  our term loan with our new senior lenders  our  unsecured subordinated promissory note with mr 
looney and optex s million secured subordinated note with mr 
looney became in default 
we have received waivers which cure these defaults  provided that we file our form k by january  upon filing our form k by january  and upon nasdaq s withdrawal of its staff determination  our management believes that we will not be in default of our timely exchange act report filing requirement or the nasdaq delisting condition under our outstanding debt instruments 
capital lease obligations 
our outstanding principal balance on our capital lease obligations of  at october  relate primarily to manufacturing and test equipment at our costa mesa  california operations and are included as part of current and non current liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet 
operating lease obligations 
we have various operating leases covering equipment and facilities located in costa mesa  california  and richardson  texas 
other commitments 
pursuant to a consulting agreement  we are obligated to pay a success fee of  to a consulting company  of which one of our directors is the sole owner  in connection with the initial acquisition of optex  which fee is a portion of the total purchase price for the optex acquisition 
see notes and to our notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed discussions of the optex acquisition and the consulting agreement 
although this fee currently is payable in cash  we have received stockholder approval to pay the fee with  shares of common stock in lieu of cash  if the consulting company or our director elects to receive said fee in this form 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period contractual obligations total year or less years years long term debt capital leases operating leases we believe  but cannot guarantee  that our government funded research and development contract business will improve in fiscal  and will therefore generate increased liquidity through both improved gross operating margins and the recovery of indirect costs as permitted under our government contracts 
this belief stems from our visibility into budgetary decisions of various government agencies and our present backlog 
at october   our funded backlog was approximately million  approximately million of which related to optex s business 
we expect that a substantial portion of our funded backlog at october  will result in revenue recognized in fiscal in addition  our government research and development contracts typically include unfunded backlog  which is funded when the previously funded amounts have been expended 
as of october   our total backlog  including unfunded portions  was approximately million 
contracts with government agencies may be suspended or terminated by the government at any time  subject to certain conditions 
similar termination provisions are typically included in agreements with prime contractors 
since our inception  we have experienced such termination of our contracts on three occasions  the latest of which was in april we cannot assure you that we will not experience suspensions or terminations in the future 
any such termination  if material  could cause a disruption of our revenue stream  adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations and could result in employee layoffs 
we also believe that our revenues from product sales will be greater in fiscal  as compared to the fiscal  partly due to the consolidation of optex s revenues for a full year in fiscal and partly because of increases in our sales of miniaturized cameras 
we further believe that these increased product sales are likely to contribute positively to our cash provided by operations 
since the earnout provision of the optex acquisition will only be paid from a percentage of surplus cash flow from optex s operations after debt service  the occurrence of such earnout  should it occur  would reflect a positive contribution from optex to our liquidity 
we currently believe that our working capital and liquidity at october   in conjunction with the refinancing of our debt in december and the million loan from timothy looney in january  will be adequate to support our 
table of contents existing operations for our foreseeable plans for at least the next twelve month 
however  there may be product sales growth opportunities in this interval that could place demands on our working capital that would require additional external infusion of working capital through equity or debt financings 
we cannot guarantee that such financings would be available on a timely basis  or on acceptable terms  or at all 
stock option based compensation as discussed in note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report  effective october   we adopted sfas r  which resulted in our recognition of stock option based compensation of  for fiscal that stock option based compensation was attributable to the following weeks ended october  cost of contract research and development revenue general and administrative expense prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for our stock option plans in accordance with accounting principle board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
as such  compensation expense was recorded at the date of grant only if the quoted closing sales price of the underlying stock on that date exceeded the exercise price of the options 
however  we have historically provided pro forma net earnings and pro forma net earnings per share disclosures as if the fair value of all stock options as of their respective grant dates were recognized as expense over the service periods of those options in accordance with sfas we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  compensation costs recognized in fiscal includes i compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet earned as of october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and ii compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to october  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  results for the corresponding periods of the prior year have not been restated  and we will continue to disclose the pro forma effect of option grants on net earnings and net earnings per share in our financial statement footnote disclosures 
we also will continue to account for equity instruments issued to persons other than our employees and directors non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for equity instruments issued to non employees are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the measurement date used to determine the fair value of any such equity instrument is the earliest to occur of i the date on which the third party performance is complete  ii the date on which it is probable that performance will occur  or iii if different  the date on which the compensation has been earned by the non employee 
however  no equity instruments were issued to non employees for goods or services during fiscal we have historically issued stock options to employees and outside directors whose only condition for vesting are continued employment or service during the related vesting period 
typically  the vesting period is up to four years for employee awards and immediate vesting for director awards  although awards are sometimes granted with two year vesting periods 
we have recently begun issuing restricted stock grants as employment inducements to new employees 
the typical restriction period for such grants is three years 
we may impose other performance criteria for the vesting of options or restricted stock granted in the future 
for purposes of sfas r  we calculate stock option based compensation by estimating the fair value of each option granted using the black scholes option valuation model and various assumptions that are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
once the compensation cost of an option is determined  we recognize that cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the option  which is typically the vesting period for options granted by us 
we calculate compensation expense of restricted stock grants by determining the fair value of each such grant as of their respective dates of grant using our stock price at such dates with no discount 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the restricted stock award 

table of contents for fiscal  stock based compensation comprised compensation costs attributable to such period for those options that were not fully vested upon adoption of sfas r and compensation costs for options and restricted stock grants that were awarded during fiscal  prorated from the date of award to october   adjusted for estimated forfeitures in accordance with sfas r 
options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock were granted to employees during fiscal awards of  shares of restricted stock were granted to employees during fiscal the method we employ to calculate stock based compensation is consistent with the method used to compute stock based compensation under sfas  except that under sfas r  we are required to estimate expected forfeitures  rather than adjusting for forfeitures when they occur as required under sfas we have estimated forfeitures to be  which reduced stock based compensation cost by  in fiscal at october   the total compensation costs related to non vested awards not yet recognized was  the weighted average remaining vesting period of unvested options at october  was years 
rule b plan in september  john carson  our ceo and president  extended his trading plan under rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended  providing for the periodic selling of up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at various pre determined market prices  which shares are purchasable by him through the exercise of certain issued and outstanding options
