item a 
risk factors in these risk factors  we  us  our  and zixcorp refer to zix corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
we have incurred significant operating losses in previous years and we continue to use significant amounts of cash for our business operations  which could result in us having insufficient cash to fund our operations under our current business plan 
we have incurred significant operating losses in previous years and we expect to incur operating losses in our pocketscript e prescribing service operates in an emerging market and developing this business is costly 
emerging market businesses involve risks and uncertainties  and there are no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts 
our liquidity and capital resources remain limited 
to date  our cash flow from operations has not been sufficient to fund our on going operations and we have relied on equity and debt financings to fund our operations 
there can be no assurance that our liquidity or capital resource position would allow us to continue to pursue our current business strategy 
as a result  without achieving growth in our business along the lines we have projected  we would have to alter our business plan or further augment our cash flow position through cost reduction measures  sales of assets  additional financings or a combination of these actions 
there is no assurance that any of these actions would be possible or could be implemented on terms acceptable to the company 
additionally  one or more of these actions would likely substantially diminish the value of our common stock 
the market may not broadly accept our email encryption and pocketscript e prescribing services  which would prevent us from operating profitably 
we must be able to achieve broad market acceptance for our email encryption and e prescribing solutions and services  at a price that provides an acceptable rate of return relative to our company wide costs in order to operate profitably 
we have not yet been able to do this 
our email encryption service operates in a maturing market 
while this business segment has begun to yield positive cash flow from operations  there are no assurances that it will yield sufficient cash flow to overcome the negative cash flow from the e prescribing segment and our corporate overhead costs 
as noted  our pocketscript e prescribing service operates in an emerging market 
there is no assurance that this market will develop sufficiently to enable us to operate our pocketscript business profitably 
for example  we have been pursuing the e prescribing business since mid our pursuit of the business has consumed significant amounts of cash and the e prescribing business is projected to continue to consume cash for the foreseeable future 
see end users of our pocketscript service may not continue to use the service under risk factors below 
failure to enter into additional or to maintain existing sponsorship agreements for our pocketscript e prescribing service and generate other revenue sources from our pocketscript service could harm our business 
our pocketscript business has incurred significant operating losses 
through december   significant orders for our pocketscript e prescribing service came from sponsorship agreements with healthcare payors 
under our payor sponsorship business model  we deploy pocketscript to the end user physician and provide the end user physician a subscription to use the service in return for payments from the healthcare payor 
these payments are in the form of guaranteed payments from the healthcare payor or contingent payments that are based on contractually specified performance metrics 
in some cases  these contingent payments could represent a substantial portion of the revenue opportunity under the contract 
substantially all of the end user physicians who are using the pocketscript service and for whom we are currently recognizing revenue are doing so under a subscription arrangement that has been paid for by a healthcare payor 
if the 
table of contents healthcare payors fail to extend their sponsorship  there is no assurance that the physicians will pay to continue to use the pocketscript service 
in addition  we obtain revenue from prescription transaction fees from pharmacy benefit managers and others with respect to the electronic prescriptions processed through our e prescribing service 
increasing our active physician user base and increasing prescription transaction and performance based fees are critical to the success of our plan to achieve profitability in our e prescribing business 
failure to sign follow on orders with additional healthcare payors from whom a significant portion of our revenues are received or sign new sponsorship agreements with other payors in the coming months  or generate significant revenue from contingent payments  or maintain and identify other revenue opportunities for our e prescribing service  such as add on applications or prescription transaction fees  and or new uses for the transaction data itself  will prevent us from achieving significant revenues from our e prescribing service 
healthcare providers may fail to adopt our pocketscript service 
our pocketscript e prescribing service is targeted to the emerging market for providing secure communications among healthcare providers to deliver information in an efficient  economical manner 
this is an emerging market  and the success of our pocketscript service is dependent  in large measure  on physicians changing the manner in which they write prescriptions 
our challenge is to make this new service attractive to physicians  and ultimately  profitable 
to do so has required  and in the foreseeable future will require  us to invest significant amounts of cash and other resources 
there is no assurance that enough paying users will ultimately be obtained to enable us to operate the pocketscript service profitably 
end users of our pocketscript service may not continue to use the service 
the company currently estimates approximately  to  active users subscribers of the e prescribing service are needed to cover its e prescribing fixed costs 
as of december   the company had approximately  such active prescribers of the service  as compared to approximately  such active prescibers as of december  see the market may not broadly accept our email encryption and pocketscript e prescribing services  which would prevent us from operating profitably in risk factors above 
not all users to whom the e prescribing service is deployed will become active users 
furthermore  the company has experienced attrition in its base of active users 
thus  there is no assurance that the company will be able to achieve a sufficient number of active users to build a successful e prescribing business 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  revenue indicators backlog  orders  and deployments 
failure to significantly increase our base of pocketscript users or obtain significant prescription transaction fees  or other fees may result in failure to achieve the critical mass of physicians and revenue to build a successful business 
we incur significant up front costs in connection with initially establishing our pocketscript e prescribing service with the physician users 
under our current business model  third party payors typically pay all or a majority of the variable costs of initially establishing our e prescribing service 
our plan is to obtain additional revenues in the form of recurring annual subscription fees to use our e prescribing service  either paid by the third party payors or the physicians 
in addition  we must obtain additional revenues from prescription transaction fees  or other fees to operate this line of business profitably 
increasing our physician user base and increasing prescription transaction fees  or generating other fees  are critical to the success of this plan 
the preponderance of the prescription transaction fees that we currently receive are from pharmacy benefit managers  which manage the prescription benefits for their health plan customers  and an electronic script aggregator  which receives scripts written by the physician user of our pocketscript e prescribing service and transmits them via electronic data interchange to retail pharmacies and certain healthcare payors 
our contracts with some of these entities are short term  meaning that the other party could cancel the contract or require us to renegotiate the contract at lower fee levels or on other unfavorable terms and conditions 
these unfavorable terms and conditions could increase our costs and could require us to revise our business model 
in sum  there is no assurance as to whether we will be able to maintain  or whether and how quickly we will be able to increase our user base or prescription transaction fees or whether we will be able to generate other fees to such a level that would enable this line of business to operate profitably 
if we are not successful in these endeavors  we could be required to revise our business model  exit or reduce the scale of our e prescribing business  or raise additional capital 

table of contents competition in our businesses is expected to increase  which could cause our business to fail 
our email encryption services are targeted to the email encryption services market 
as the public s and governmental authorities awareness about the need for privacy and security of electronic communications has increased over the past few years  an increasing number of well funded competitors have entered the market 
companies that compete with our email encryption services include content management and secure delivery companies  such as tumbleweed communications corp  and other secure delivery participants  such as voltage security  postx recently acquired by cisco systems inc  pgp corporation  certified mail  authentica  secure computing and sigaba corporation 
in addition  we face competition from vendors of internet server appliances  operating systems  networking hardware  network management solutions  and security software  many of which now  or may in the future  develop or bundle email encryption into their products 
some of these competing companies have substantial information technology security and email protection products 
our pocketscript e prescribing service applies the benefits of e messaging to the medical prescription process by enabling providers to write and transmit prescriptions electronically directly to the pharmacy 
competition is expected to increase as this emerging market continues to develop and it becomes generally apparent that there are viable business models for commercial success in this market 
participants in the e prescribing space include allscripts healthcare solutions  medplus  dr 
first  inc  instantdx llc  and iscribe 
competition from these companies and from vendors in related areas  such as electronic medical records vendors who are expected to include e prescribing services as an element of their service offering is expected to increase 
companies that do not currently compete with zixcorp or only compete with selected products or in selected markets could become competitors in the future on a larger scale 
companies such as ge healthcare or mckesson corporation would likely offer a broad portfolio of health information technologies for all or some of the pharmaceutical  pharmacy  healthcare provider  and managed care markets 
with considerable size and access to capital  they could become significant competitors 
we may face increased competition as these competitors partner with others or develop new solution and service offerings to expand the functionality that they can offer to their customers 
our competitors may  over time  develop new technologies that are perceived as being more secure  effective  or cost efficient than our own 
these competitors could successfully garner a significant share of the market  to the exclusion of our company 
furthermore  increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced margins  or the failure of our business to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any one of which could harm our business 
our inability to successfully execute timely development and introduction of new email encryption and e prescribing services and related services and to implement technological changes could harm our business 
the evolving nature of the email encryption and e prescribing businesses require us to continually develop and introduce new and related solutions and services and to improve the performance  features  and reliability of our existing solutions and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
we have under development new feature sets for our email encryption and e prescribing businesses 
we may also introduce new services 
the success of new or enhanced features and services depends on several factors primarily market acceptance 
we may not succeed in developing and marketing new or enhanced features and services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs 
this could harm our business 
future asset impairments could affect our financial results 
as of december   we have million of goodwill on our balance sheet relating to the email encryption segment 
goodwill is evaluated at least on an annual basis or whenever there is a reason to question if the goodwill values are impaired 
we also have million of property and other long lived assets 
the carrying value of these assets are evaluated whenever there is reason to question if the values are impaired 
future events could impact the valuation of goodwill and long lived assets  which could require us to recognize a non cash charge to earnings 
it is possible that we may incur further charges for other asset impairments in the future as we evaluate the prospects of our various lines of business 
capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project  and we may not be able to expand and or upgrade our systems to meet increased use  which would result in reduced revenues 
while we have ample through put capacity to handle our customers requirements for the medium term  at some point if we achieve greater market penetration we may be required to materially expand and or upgrade our technology and network hardware and software 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage of our network  particularly since we have significantly expanded our potential customer base by the growing use of our pocketscript service 
in addition  we may not be able to expand and or upgrade our systems and network hardware and software capabilities in a timely manner to accommodate increased traffic on our network 
if we do not 
table of contents appropriately expand and or upgrade our systems and network hardware and software in a timely fashion  we may lose customers and revenues 
security interruptions to our data centers could disrupt our business  and any security breaches could expose us to liability and negatively impact customer demand for our solutions and services 
our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our data centers currently  our zixdata center located in dallas  texas  and the austin  texas data center used for fail over and business continuity services 
we must protect these centers from loss  damage  or interruption caused by fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  or other events beyond our control 
we do not carry insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in our data centers operations could result in loss of or delay in revenues  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  litigation claims  increased insurance costs  or increased service and warranty costs 
this could materially harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  our ability to provide our services and to support the e prescribing service depends on the efficient operation of the internet connections between customers and our data centers 
we depend on internet service providers for these connections 
these providers have experienced periodic operational problems or outages in the past 
any of these problems or outages could adversely affect customer satisfaction 
we do not carry insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
furthermore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and the market perceives them to be secure 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers  and similar disruptions 
in addition  we are vulnerable to coordinated attempts to overload our systems with data  resulting in denial or reduction of service to some or all of our users for a period of time 
we do not carry insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
secure messages sent through our zixport and zixmessage center messaging portals  in connection with the operation of our email encryption service  include personal healthcare information as well as personal financial information 
this information will reside  for a user specified period of time  in our secure data center network  and individual prescription histories transmitted through our e prescribing system and other personally identifiable healthcare information will reside in our secure data center network indefinitely 
federal and state laws impose significant financial penalties for unauthorized disclosure of personal information 
exposure of this information  resulting from any physical or electronic break ins or other security breaches or compromises of this information  could expose us to significant liability  and customers could be reluctant to use our internet related services 
pending litigation could have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition 
beginning in early september  several purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the us district court for the northern district of texas  dallas division  against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
the purported class action lawsuits seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of purchasers of zixcorp s common stock between october  and may  the purported shareholder class action lawsuits allege that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements and or omissions in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  during this time period 
these several class action lawsuits have been consolidated into one case 
the company s motion to dismiss the consolidated lawsuits pursuant to rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure and pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act was denied in september by the court before whom the matter is pending 
the consolidated class action lawsuit is proceeding in due course  and the lawsuit is in the early phase of the discovery process 
also  three purported shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
these derivative lawsuits were filed in september  october and november the purported shareholder derivative lawsuits relate to the allegedly materially false and misleading statements and or omissions that are the subject of the purported shareholder class action lawsuits 
the derivative lawsuits name zixcorp as a nominal defendant and as actual defendants the individuals named in the purported shareholder class action lawsuits mentioned above and others 
the suits seek to require zixcorp to initiate legal action for unspecified damages against the individual defendants named in the purported shareholder class action lawsuits 
the suits also allege breaches of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  insider selling  and misappropriation of information  and seek contribution and indemnification against the individual defendants 

table of contents these lawsuits may require significant management time and attention and could result in significant legal expenses 
while we believe these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously  we are unable to predict the scope or outcome of these matters and quantify their eventual impact  if any  on our company 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flow  and financial condition 
we maintain insurance that may limit our financial exposure for defense costs and liability for an unfavorable outcome  should we not prevail  for claims covered by the insurance coverage 
such insurance coverage may not be sufficient or available to cover the entirety of our financial exposure for these claims 
we may have to defend our rights in intellectual property that we use in our services  which could be disruptive and expensive to our business 
we may have to defend our intellectual property rights or defend against claims that we are infringing the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
infringement claims could require us to develop non infringing services or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to develop or license the necessary technology 
furthermore  it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property  thus enabling them to effectively compete against us 
defects or errors in our services could harm our business 
we subject our solutions and services to quality assurance testing prior to release 
regardless of the quality assurance testing  any of our solutions could contain undetected defects or errors 
in particular  our pocketscript system is used to transmit prescriptions 
defects or errors in our pocketscript system could result in inaccurate prescriptions being generated  which could result in injury or death to patients 
undetected defects or errors could result in loss of or delay in revenues  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  litigation claims  increased insurance costs  or increased service and warranty costs 
any one of these could prevent us from implementing our business model and achieving the revenues we need to operate profitably 
public key cryptography technology is subject to risks 
our email encryption service and the e prescribing service employ  and future solutions and services may employ  public key cryptography technology 
with public key cryptography technology  a public key and a private key are used to encrypt and decrypt messages 
the security afforded by this technology depends  in large measure  on the integrity of the private key  which is dependent  in part  on the application of certain mathematical principles 
the integrity of the private key is predicated on the assumption that it is difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key 
should methods be developed that make it easier to derive the private key  the security of encryption services using public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated and such services could become unmarketable 
this could require us to make significant changes to our services  which could increase our costs  damage our reputation  or otherwise hurt our business 
moreover  there have been public reports of the successful decryption of certain encrypted messages 
this or related publicity could adversely affect public perception of the security afforded by public key cryptography technology  which could harm our business 
we depend on key personnel 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team including our chairman  ceo  president and coo  richard d 
spurr  and his direct reports and other key employees  particularly highly skilled technical personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain  and motivate these individuals 
there are no binding agreements with any of our employees that prevent them from leaving our company at any time 
there is competition for these personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our failure to attract  retain  and motivate key employees could harm our business 
we rely on third parties 
if critical services and products that we source from third parties were to no longer be made available to us or at a considerably higher price than we currently pay for them  and suitable alternatives could not be found  our business could be harmed 
for certain elements of our service offerings  we sometimes rely on the products and services of third parties 
in particular  we currently rely on one third party to supply the hand held device primarily used by the prescribing physician users of our e prescribing service 
in the fourth quarter of  we received an end of life product notice from this vendor 
consequently  we procured sufficient quantities of this device to accommodate forecasted deployments 
there is no assurance that we procured a sufficient number of devices to fulfill actual needs in  or that the company will be successful in locating an alternate device at a reasonable price 
if we are not able to do so in this particular case  or if these third parties  in general  elect to withhold their products or services or significantly raise their prices  we could be damaged financially in lower returns on sales and a lessening of competitive advantages if suitable alternatives could not be found in a reasonable period of time 

table of contents we could be affected by government regulation 
exports of software solutions and services using encryption technology  such as our email encryption service  are generally restricted by the us government 
although we have obtained us government approval to export our email encryption service to almost all countries  the list of countries to which our solutions and services cannot be exported could be revised in the future 
furthermore  some countries impose restrictions on the use of encryption solutions and services  such as ours 
failure to obtain the required governmental approvals would preclude the sale or use of our solutions and services in international markets and  therefore  harm the company s ability to grow sales through expansion into international markets 
furthermore  boards of pharmacy in the various states in which our e prescribing business operates regulate the process by which physicians write prescriptions 
while regulations in the states in which our e prescribing business currently operates generally permit the electronic writing of prescriptions  such regulations could be revised in the future 
moreover  regulations in states in which our e prescribing business does not currently operate may not be as favorable and may impede our ability to develop business in these states 
the federal government has adopted final regulations to create an exception to the prohibition on physicians referrals to healthcare entities with which they have financial relationships for certain electronic prescribing arrangements  to be codified at cfr v  and an exception to the related federal healthcare anti kickback rules for certain electronic prescribing arrangements  to be codified at cfr x 
the purpose of the regulations is to encourage physicians to use electronic prescribing systems to create and deliver prescriptions to the pharmacy 
the regulations seek to accomplish this purpose by creating certain safe harbors that are intended to encourage healthcare entities  such as health insurance companies and hospitals  to provide financial incentives to physicians to use electronic prescribing systems 
there is no assurance that the regulations will actually encourage the use of electronic prescribing systems 
furthermore  the regulations could provide other participants in the market a competitive advantage or could have currently unforeseen consequences that harm our business 
also  future state or federal regulation could mandate standards for the electronic writing of prescriptions or for the secure electronic transmittal of personal health information through the internet that our technology and systems do not comply with  which would require us to modify our technology and systems 
many of these standards are currently being pilot tested in their initial form and may be subject to change  accelerated compliance restrictions or select re implementations  based on resulting industry recommendations 
the costs of compliance could be substantial 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
furthermore  our stock price may decrease as a result of the dilutive effect caused by the additional number of shares that may become available in the market due to the issuances of our common stock in connection with the capital funding and acquisition transactions we completed over the last few years 
also  as of february   there was a reported short position in our common stock of  shares approximately of our outstanding number of shares  which may affect the volatility of our stock price 
we have a significant amount of stock options and warrants outstanding and may issue additional equity securities in the future 
exercise of the outstanding options and warrants  and future issuances of other securities will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders 
we have outstanding warrants and options  including options held by our employees  covering approximately million shares of our common stock with exercise prices ranging from to 
the issuances of shares of common stock in respect of these warrants and options would result in a substantial voting dilution of our current shareholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or redemption of the note or exercise of the warrants and options could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in the future  we may determine to seek additional capital funding or to acquire additional businesses  which could involve the issuance of one or more types of equity securities  including convertible debt  common and convertible preferred stock  and warrants to acquire common or preferred stock 
such equity securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
in addition  we motivate our employees and attract new employees by issuing shares of our common stock and options to purchase shares of our common stock 
the interest of our existing shareholders may be diluted by any equity securities issued in 
table of contents capital funding financings or business acquisitions and would be diluted by any such future share issuances and stock option grants to employees 
finally  as a result of the anti dilution provisions of the warrants described above  we may be obligated to increase the number of shares that may be acquired upon exercise of our warrants and reduce the exercise price of such warrants 
we might also be obligated to register with the sec additional shares of common stock issuable to the warrant holders for public resale 
the company may be required to pay liquidated damages in the event one or more of the registration statements it has filed with the sec for the benefit of third parties ceases to be effective 
the company has filed a number of registration statements with the sec for the benefit of third parties 
these registration statements permit the public resale of the company s common stock held by  or potentially issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants to  these parties 
in some cases  the company would be required to pay liquidated damages to the third parties if the company fails to maintain the effectiveness of the relevant registration statement for the contractually required period of time 
the amount of damages the company would be required to pay could be substantial  as a percentage of the company s cash on hand  depending on when the registration statement ceased to be effective 
see  for example  note to the company s consolidated financial statements  regarding the potential payment of liquidated damages related to the april  private placement 
we may have liability for indemnification claims arising from the sale of our web inspector  message inspector  and dr 
chart product lines 
we disposed of our web inspector and message inspector product lines in march and our dr 
chart product line in september in selling those product lines  we agreed to provide customary indemnification to the purchasers of those businesses for breaches of representations and warranties  covenants  and other specified matters 
indemnification claims could be asserted against us with respect to these matters 
there are no assurances that we will be successful or that we will not encounter other  and even unanticipated  risks 
we discuss other operating  financial or legal risks or uncertainties in our periodic filings with the sec 
we are  of course  also subject to general economic risks

table of contents item properties during zixcorp leased properties that are considered material to the operations of the company in the following locations burlington  massachusetts  ottawa  ontario  canada  as well as dallas and austin  texas 
with the exception of the dallas and austin offices  all locations are used solely for selling  marketing  and development activities 
all properties are used by both business segments  with the exception of the burlington facility which is used exclusively for the email encryption business 
the dallas office is the company headquarters and the location of the zixdata center 
the austin location maintains the equipment necessary to implement full disaster recovery and is not used to support ongoing company operations 
the zixcorp facilities are suitable for the company s current needs and are considered adequate to support expected growth 
the company has additional leases in round rock  texas and mason  ohio which are excess capacity and the company is seeking to reduce the current space in these locations 
item legal proceedings beginning in early september  several purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the us district court for the northern district of texas  dallas division against the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors 
the purported class action lawsuits seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of purchasers of the company s common stock between october   and may  the purported shareholder class action lawsuits allege that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements and or omissions in violation of sections b and a of the exchange act during this time period 
these several class action lawsuits have been consolidated into one case 
the named defendants are zix corporation  dennis f 
heathcote  daniel s 
nutkis  john a 
ryan  ronald a 
woessner  and steve m 
york 
the company s motion to dismiss the consolidated lawsuits pursuant to rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure and pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act was denied in september by the court before whom the matter is pending 
the consolidated class action lawsuit is proceeding in due course  and the lawsuit is in the early phase of the discovery process 
also  three shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed against the company and certain named individuals  as described below 
these derivative lawsuits were filed in september  october and november two of the derivative lawsuits are pending in the us district court for the northern district of texas  dallas division  and one is pending in the county court at law no 
two  dallas county  texas 
the purported shareholder derivative lawsuits relate to the allegedly materially false and misleading statements and or omissions that are the subject of the purported shareholder class action lawsuits 
the derivative lawsuits name the company as a nominal defendant and as actual defendants the individuals named in the purported shareholder class action lawsuits mentioned above  as well as bradley c

streetman 
the suits seek to require the company to initiate legal action for unspecified damages against the individual defendants named in the shareholder class action lawsuits 
the suits also allege breaches of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  insider selling  gross mismanagement  waste of corporate assets and misappropriation of information and seek contribution and indemnification against the individual defendants 
one of the shareholder derivative lawsuits was stayed by agreement of the parties 
the court has consolidated the third derivative lawsuit with the first derivative suit and stayed the case 
the plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to  in effect  revoke the stay  which the court denied 
on march   the plaintiff filed another motion to lift the stay 
the plaintiff in the second derivative lawsuit has begun to proceed with the second shareholder derivative lawsuit 
the board of directors of the company has appointed a committee of disinterested and independent board members pursuant to applicable texas law to review the derivative proceedings and determine the appropriate course of action relative to the resolution of the derivative proceedings 
under applicable texas law  the appointment of this committee entitles the company to request of the courts that the derivative lawsuits be stayed until such time as the committee makes this determination  although there is no assurance that the court will agree to stay the derivative lawsuits 
the company has indemnification obligations to the individual defendants above  the terms of which provide for no limitation to the maximum future payments under such indemnifications 
the company has evaluated these indemnifications and determined that no accrual is necessary

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of january   the company operated two reporting segments  email encryption and e prescribing  providing easy to use and deploy e communication services that connect enterprises and consumers in the healthcare  finance  insurance  and government sectors to protect and deliver sensitive information 
the email encryption service is a comprehensive secure messaging service  which allows an enterprise to use policy driven rules to determine which emails need to be sent securely to comply with regulations or corporate policy and is primarily offered as a hosted service solution  whereby customers pay an annual service subscription 
the company first targeted the healthcare sector  where the legislated mandates of the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa  a law that requires protected health information to be safeguarded over open networks  are driving demand 
the company continues to make strategic efforts to expand its direct sales and marketing outside of its core market of healthcare into financial services  insurance  and government sectors  as well as  expanding the company s distribution and reseller networks  which target non healthcare vertical markets 
the email encryption service was previously referred to by the company as esecure when it had also included the mi wi products  which were obtained in the elron software  inc acquisition in september  and subsequently sold to cyberguard in march as a component of the company s strategic plan to bring about more focus on the email encrpytion service see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in july  the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and the business of pocketscript  llc pocketscript  a privately held development stage enterprise that provided electronic prescription solutions for the healthcare industry 
this acquisition enabled the company to expand its services into the e prescribing marketplace  which continues to be viewed as a promising market as more physicians leverage technology in delivering care 
the company s expansion into the e prescribing market was made more attractive by the fact that the number of prescriptions written annually in the united states continues to increase and confidence in the safety of written prescriptions declines 
e prescribing is offered as a hosted service solution and consists of a single product line named pocketscript 
pocketscript is an electronic prescribing service that allows physicians to use a handheld device to prescribe drugs and transmit the prescription electronically to any pharmacy 
during the prescribing process  the physician is provided with real time information such as insurance formulary and comprehensive drug data that normally would not be available in a paper prescription format 
this allows the physician to leverage technology for better patient care at the point of care 
the company s primary go to market model regarding the pocketscript product is to sell the service to major national insurance payors  such as blue cross blue shield entities and aetna  who in turn provide it to physicians at no cost for the first year of service sponsorship of the service in their coverage area 
economically  the company relies on the annual service fees paid by the insurance payors or the physicians  as well as  current and future anticipated transaction fees to make this business profitable 
e prescribing had previously included the dr 
chart hospital based lab results delivery product  obtained in the mydoconline acquisition in january  and subsequently sold to mitem in september as a component of the company s strategic plan to bring about more focus on the e prescribing product line see note to the consolidated financial statements 
also  e prescribing was referred to by the company in the past as ehealth 
the company s primary business strategy is the continued development and growth of a subscription business 
the company seeks to build and maintain reliable revenue growth by adding new customers while retaining a high percentage of existing customers 
the subscription model requires large up front investment to establish the service  but over time the fixed set up costs are exceeded by the recurring subscription and transaction fees 
the subscription business provides better returns after the setup costs are overcome as incremental costs to add new users are low relative to the incremental subscription revenue 
as a secondary  but equally important  business strategy  the company is balancing the cash produced by its more mature segment  email encryption  with the cash required to develop its emerging segment  e prescribing 

table of contents operationally  the success of the company is primarily dependent upon the following key metrics rate of new subscriptions termed new first year orders for the email encryption service renewal rates for the email encryption service new insurance payor sponsorships of the pocketscript service to physicians successful adoption and usage of the pocketscript service by physicians retention of the users physicians of the pocketscript service future transaction fees or related fees associated with the use of the pocketscript service the ability to increase the business volume with reasonable cost increases known trends regarding these key metrics and their implication on the company s current and future capital requirements are discussed throughout this md a 
there are no assurances that the company will be successful in its efforts 
the company s continued growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of its products and services 
the company has incurred significant operating losses and used significant cash resources in prior years 
while the company experienced improvement in its cash flow performance in  further operating losses are expected in the company will continue to place a strong emphasis on actions to become cash flow breakeven as it balances the need for investments in its developing and emerging markets 
this emphasis might entail near term cost reductions that may come in the form of workforce reductions  decreased investments in certain areas of the business  or business divestitures 
strategic actions intended to achieve the goal of cash flow breakeven might have intended or unintended short term adverse effects on certain financial performance metrics for the company 
see item a  risk factors for more information on the effects to the company if the company s business plan is not successful and liquidity worsens 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
inventory the company s inventory consists of handheld devices and related networking hardware for e prescribing and is reported as a component of prepaid and other current assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the inventory is valued at average purchase price and is reviewed quarterly for potential adjustments resulting from lower of cost or market valuations or obsolescence 
in the fourth quarter of  the company received an end of life product notice from its handheld device vendor giving notice that the handheld devices currently used will not be manufactured in consequently  the company procured sufficient quantities of handheld devices to accommodate forecasted deployments 
property and equipment  long lived and other intangible assets  depreciation and amortization the accounting policies and estimates relating to the property and equipment  long lived and other intangible assets  depreciation and amortization are considered critical because of the significant impact that impairment  obsolescence  or change in an asset s useful life could have on the company s operating results 
property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as follows computer and office equipment and software three years  leasehold improvements the shorter of five years or the lease term  and furniture and fixtures five years 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of three years 

table of contents the company s long lived assets subject to amortization and depreciation are comprised of identified intangible assets and property and equipment aggregating  or of total assets at december  property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when certain triggering events occur where there is reason to believe that the carrying value may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
the amount of a potential impairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to either the value determined from a projected discounted cash flow method  using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model or the estimated fair market value 
assumptions are made with respect to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset 
an impairment charge would be recorded for an amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeded the discounted projected net cash flows or estimated fair market value 
also  even where a current impairment charge is not necessary  the remaining useful lives are evaluated 
during the first quarter of  the company evaluated the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets relating to the mydoconline acquisition and concluded that the lives for developed technology and customer relationships should be reduced to years from years and years  respectively 
this change in estimate was accounted for prospectively beginning january  also during and  the company recorded  and  impairment charges  respectively on fixed assets that were not being utilized and which had no perceived future value 
in  the company recorded an impairment charge of  related to the connect service acquired in the mydoconline acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill goodwill  totaling  or of total assets at december   represents the remaining cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in the september acquisition of elron software 
goodwill was  or of total assets at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not being amortized  however  the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
evaluations for possible impairment are based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit including the assigned goodwill value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based on the company s market capitalization  which is based on the outstanding stock and market price of the stock 
an impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of the unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the sale of the message inspector and web inspector products in the first quarter of  which were a significant part of the elron acquisition  caused the company to evaluate the goodwill assigned to the esecure reporting unit 
as a result  the company reduced goodwill in the first quarter of by  as part of the carrying value of the net assets related to that transaction 
this represented of the acquired goodwill from the elron acquisition 
the sale of the dr 
chart product in september caused the company to evaluate the goodwill associated with the purchase of mydoconline  of which dr 
chart was a significant portion 
as a result  the company included in the carrying amount of assets sold in the dr 
chart sale  the entire goodwill balance of  associated with the acquisition of mydoconline 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure of these transactions 
future changes made to the current estimates or assumptions  including such factors as order volumes and price levels  life spans of purchased technology  continuity of acquired customers  alternative uses for property and equipment and levels of operating expenses  could result in an unanticipated impairment charge from the write down of the company s long lived assets or goodwill 
deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the subject net operating loss carryforwards and unused tax credits will be realized on future federal income tax returns 
at december   the company continued to provide a full valuation allowance against accumulated us deferred tax assets of  reflecting the company s historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income 
if the company begins to generate us taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which its estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required 
reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  as promulgated by statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  eitf abstract no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and other related pronouncements 
accounting for revenue is complex due to the long term and often multiple element nature of zixcorp s contracts with customers and the potential for incorrect application of accounting guidance requires that revenue recognition be considered a critical accounting policy 
the company develops  markets  licenses and supports electronic information protection services 
the company s services can be placed into several key revenue categories where each category has similar revenue recognition traits email encryption subscription based service  e prescribing service  various transaction fees and related professional services 
a majority of the revenues generated by the company are through direct sales  however  for email encryption service the company employs a network of distributors and resellers 
under all product categories and distribution models  the company recognizes revenue after all of the following occur persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in the event the arrangement has multiple elements with delivered and undelivered elements  revenue for the delivered elements are recognized under the residual method only when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists to allocate the fair value of the total fees to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
occasionally  when zixcorp is engaged in a complex product deployment  customer acceptance may have to occur before the transaction is considered complete 
in this situation no revenue is recognized until the customer accepts the product 
discounts provided to customers are recorded as reductions in revenue 
the email encryption service is a subscription based service 
in the first nine months of  subscription based services also included dr 
chart  which was sold by the company in september see note to the consolidated financial statements 
providing these services includes delivering licensed software and providing secure electronic communications and customer support throughout the subscription period 
in the case of zixvpm  typically  as part of the service  an appliance with pre installed software is installed at the customer site at the beginning of the subscription period 
in a subscription service  the customer does not own a perpetual right to a software license  but is instead granted the use of that license during the period of the service subscription 
subscriptions are generally multiple year contracts that are irrevocable and non refundable in nature and require annual  up front payments 
the subscription period begins on the date specified by the parties or when the service is fully functional for the customer which is consequently deemed to be the date of acceptance 
revenues from subscription services are recorded as service revenue as the services are rendered from the date of acceptance over the subscription period 
subscription fees received from customers in advance are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the subscription period 
e prescribing service arrangements contain multiple deliverables including both hardware and services 
due to the lack of vsoe  these elements are combined into a single unit of accounting and  similar to email encryption  recognized as service revenue ratably over the longer of the subscription term or expected renewal period 
revenue recognition begins upon installation of the required hardware and commencement of service 
prior to the third quarter  the company did maintain vsoe for certain service elements of the e prescribing service 
accordingly  the residual value assigned to the pocketscript handheld device was recognized as revenue upon installation and the fair value of the undelivered services were recognized ratably over the period in which those services were delivered 
in and the first quarter  the company sold anti spam filtering  email content filtering  and web filtering solutions under the mi wi product line to customers under perpetual licensing arrangements 
the mi wi product line was sold by the company in march see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these perpetual software licenses were normally sold as part of multiple element arrangements that included annual maintenance and or subscription  and may have included implementation or training services 
evidence of vsoe for implementation and training services associated with the anti spam  email content filtering and web filtering arrangements was based upon standard billing rates and the estimated level of effort for the individuals expected to perform the related services 
installation and training revenues were recognized as the services were rendered 
the company established vsoe for maintenance based upon maintenance that was sold separately 
maintenance revenue was recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement  generally one year 

table of contents some of the company s services incorporate a transaction fee per event occurrence or when predetermined usage levels have been reached 
these fees are recognized as revenue when the transaction occurs or when the predetermined usage levels have been achieved  and when the amounts are fixed and determinable 
the company does not offer stand alone services 
further  the company s services include various warranty provisions  however  warranty expense was not material to any period presented 
deferred cost of revenue in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy  the revenue associated with certain pocketscript deployments is being recognized ratably over the period the services are being delivered 
to properly match direct costs and revenue  the company defers the direct  incremental costs of each deployment expected to be recovered 
these costs consist mainly of the cost of the handheld device  and are recorded as deferred cost of revenue 
the deferred costs are then amortized into cost of revenue ratably over the period in which revenue is recognized 
the deferred cost of revenue of  and  is included in other assets as of december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted sfas r  share based payment  and has elected to use the modified prospective method along with the straight line amortization method for recognizing stock option compensation costs 
for periods prior to january   the company used the intrinsic value method to account for stock based compensation plans under the provisions of accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
sfas r replaces the intrinsic value measurement objective in apb and requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  ie  the requisite service period which is usually the vesting period 
the standard also requires companies to estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be earned  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
the company used the black scholes option pricing model bsopm to determine the fair value of option grants made during  and the company estimated the average holding period of vested options to be two years from the vesting period years for options granted before  but used the simplified method per sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  to calculate the estimated life of options granted to employees subsequent to december  the expected stock price volatility was calculated by averaging the historical volatility of the company s common stock over a term equal to the expected life of the options 
the following weighted average assumptions were applied in determining the fair value of options granted during the respective periods year ended december  risk free interest rate expected option life years years years expected stock price volatility expected dividend yield fair value of options granted the assumptions used in the bsopm valuation are critical as a change in any given factor could have a material impact on the financial results of the company 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company applied apb no

the company had full time headcount of on december  compared to on december  private placement in april see note to the consolidated financial statements on april   the company sold  in a private placement transaction  an aggregate of  units consisting of i one share of common stock of the company  par value per share and ii a related warrant to purchase of one share of common stock or  warrants

table of contents unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs against the loss on extinguishment of debt 
the total loss on extinguishment of debt was  results of operations revenues the company s revenues have continuously increased from through mainly due to growth of the email encryption market  primarily driven by hipaa requirements in the healthcare industry 
however the e prescribing business also experienced growth of and in and  respectively 
growth in and in email encryption and e prescribing was offset by the sales of the mi wi and dr 
chart products in when combined  the sales of mi wi and dr 
chart resulted in revenue decreases of  in and  in the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the key components of the company s revenues variance variance year ended december  vs

in and  the mi wi products were primarily sold as perpetual licenses with annual maintenance and or subscription contracts 
prior to the third quarter of  e prescribing incorporated a separate hardware and installation element  and the dr 
chart product and services represented either a subscription based arrangement or a perpetual license sale 
with the exception of perpetual software licenses mi wi products and occasionally the dr 
chart product and early stage e prescribing contracts  the company has generally recognized revenue over the life of a related service contracts under services revenue 
the shift towards mostly subscription based offerings in late led to the decline in hardware revenue and the sale of the mi wi product lines in the first quarter of led to the decline in software revenue 
the company believes that total revenue by product provides a more meaningful examination of the company s revenue sources and trends variance variance year ended december  vs

email encryption e prescribing subtotal before divested products or services mi wi products dr 
chart and connect subtotal divested products or services total revenues email encryption the revenue increases of  and  in email encryption for and  respectively  over the previous years revenue are due to the company adding new subscribers to the service while renewing a high percentage of existing subscribers as their service contracts expire 
the company s additions to the subscriber base is best measured by new first year orders which are defined as the portion of new orders that are expected to be recognized into revenue in the first twelve months of the contract 
in and the new first year orders were approximately  and  respectively 
the new first year orders in were higher than due largely to regulatory deadlines associated with the hipaa regulations which mandated the encryption of emails that contain personal health information 
as the company has continued to add new customers the renewal rate of existing customers has consistently remained approximately for the periods shown above 
table of contents which has led to the yearly revenue growth 
the company believes that revenue will continue to grow in email encryption  but it is unlikely that the growth rates will continue 
the recurring nature of the subscription model makes revenue rise in a predictable manner assuming continued new additions to the subscription base and adequate subscription renewal rates 
adding to the predictability is the company s go to market model of selling primarily three year subscription contracts with the fees paid annually 
the company s list pricing for email encryption has remained generally consistent in when compared with and the company has experienced relatively consistent discount percentages off the list price in those periods 
in general  customers that are due for renewal are renewed at a price equal to or greater than their previous service period 
e prescribing e prescribing revenues increased  in compared to this increase was mainly driven by transaction usage based fees which increased by  when compared to additionally  revenue recognized on deployments to new pocketscript users increased  when compared to the total new users of the service for which revenue could be recognized increased from approximately  in to approximately  in this increase in billable users was offset by a decrease in the average price per billable deployment of 
revenues relating to one time projects increased by  in when compared to these one time projects are not expected to be repeated on a regular basis and usually relate to special projects and requests made by customers 
one customer accounted for  of the increase in transaction usage based fees and this customer is only contractually bound to continue these fees through the company is working with the customer to continue these fees or replace them with new contracts with existing and or new customers  but it is not known if it will be successful in its efforts 
the revenues in e prescribing increased by  when compared to this growth is mainly attributable to the overall growth in the e prescribing business in overall new deployments under all e prescribing contracts were relatively flat in compared to which lead to revenue growth as new users were added and a portion of the old users of the service renewed their subscription 
this growth was offset by changes in revenue recognition which caused the company to defer more revenue on new deployments and recognize the revenue over the term that the service is delivered 
divested products the decline in revenues from the web inspector and message inspector products and the dr 
chart products resulted from the divestitures of these products in march and september  respectively 
the web inspector and message inspector product lines  which were acquired in the elron acquisition  were sold to cyberguard corporation and the dr 
chart product  which was acquired in the mydoconline acquisition  was sold to mitem see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue outlook the company s future revenue growth is expected to come from continued success in the email encryption business  including the use of the company s email encryption service in the healthcare industry and the company s recent expansion into new vertical markets such as financial services  insurance  government sectors  as well as from the expansion of the company s distribution and reseller networks  which target various vertical markets 
the e prescribing market growth is expected to come from broader market adoption of the e prescribing technology and increased transaction usage based fees 
backlog  orders  and deployments company wide backlog the company s end user order backlog is comprised of contractually bound agreements that the company expects to fully amortize into revenue 
as of december   the backlog was approximately  and is comprised of the following elements  of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid   billed but unpaid and approximately  of signed  but unbilled contracts 
the backlog can also be divided by product  of which  is for email encryption and  is for e prescribing 
excluded from the backlog at december   is a customer deposit from sanofi aventis of  the deposit is excluded from backlog because the company currently does not expect that sanofi aventis will request that any service be performed under the contract 
as a result  the deposit will be forfeited and no revenue will be recognized 
the company believes that the expected lack of performance stems from the aventis acquisition by sanofi 
sanofi aventis has communicated to the company that after the acquisition  sanofi aventis has undertaken a new direction and that the services will likely not be needed see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the backlog is recognized into revenue as the services are performed 
approximately of the total backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue during the next twelve months 
the timing of revenue is affected by both the length of time required to deploy a service and the length of the service contract 
the company s future revenue growth beyond what is scheduled to be recognized from the backlog is determined by additional new first year orders and total orders for email encryption coupled with renewal rates for existing customers whose contracts are expiring 
for e prescribing the future revenue will be determined by securing additional payor sponsorships  increasing adoption and utilization by the physicians  renewing existing deployments as they expire  and developing additional transaction based fees 
email encryption orders the order input for email encryption in was  compared with  in the new subscriber momentum is better measured in terms of the dollar amount of new first year orders for the service 
the new first year orders were  in and  in new first year orders are a subset of the total orders and a more accurate determinant of new subscription growth 
total orders include new first year orders and also includes renewals and additional years of the service contracted upfront 
the renewal rate for secure messaging customers was approximately for and the company continues to experience a high percentage of customers who choose to subscribe for the email encryption service for a three year term versus a one year term 
the company expects this preference for a longer contract term to continue in  as the company has priced its services in a manner that encourages longer term contractual commitments from customers 
while the company experienced a price increase for its email encryption service in relative to and has maintained these pricing levels through  there are no assurances that the increasing competition in this market will not result in price erosion in and beyond 
such a price erosion  should it occur  could have a dampening effect on the company s new first year orders and thus  its future revenues 
alternatively  the company s market share in certain vertical markets could allow for pricing increases 
the following table provides the relevant trend of new first year orders three month period ending december  september  june  march  total new first year orders for the twelve months ending december  focusing on the reduction in new first year orders for versus  the company believes that the decline reflects the one time surge in demand in the healthcare industry with the hipaa security rule going into effect april while zixcorp continues to see steady demand from the healthcare sector  the industry is beginning to mature which has resulted in the efforts to diversify its business into new sectors 
the company s more recent focus on new markets such as financial services  insurance and government will enable it to sustain or increase the new first year order rate in e prescribing in e prescribing  the company builds the subscriber base by contracting with health insurance companies payors to sponsor physicians in their network to receive the e prescribing equipment and service free of charge for the first year 
as of december   the company has active contracts with seven such payors 
in  the company secured sponsorships of  new subscribers which compares to  new subscribers in the current list prices for initial and subsequent annual renewal periods for the e prescribing service are  and  respectively  and the company has had recent success in both securing contracts at the list price and receiving more beneficial payment terms 
future revenue growth is dependent on expanding current payor sponsorships  securing additional payor contracts  achieving and increasing adoption and utilization by the sponsored physicians  renewing service contracts for active physicians at the end of their sponsorship  and developing additional transaction based fees 
the deployments of subscribers and active users are indicators of future revenue 
in  the company deployed approximately  units compared with approximately  in the company has approximately  sponsored  but not yet deployed  prescribers in deployment backlog as of december  also as of december   the company had approximately  active prescribers using the service 
the number of active users is important as a measurement of the user base that is actively using the service to a meaningful level in order to generate transaction revenue and as a result  it is an indicator of retention and future 
table of contents renewal opportunity 
the company has a twofold objective in deploying new users first  to ensure they become regular users of the service active and second  to ensure that services are renewed retention 
based on current trends  the company believes that between to of the users deployed in will ultimately become active users 
the company is continuing its efforts to increase the percentage of active users and hopes that the percentage will increase over time 
while the sponsorship contracts identify the individual physicians using the device as being responsible for renewing the service after the first year  the erx collaborative recently elected to renew the service for their active users for the third time and the company anticipates that it will continue to do so in the future 
other sponsors have also agreed to pay for some or all of the license fee for active users 
the total transaction and usage based fees recognized as revenue during were  compared to  in the company currently has transaction based contracts under which it earns fees for some prescriptions sent electronically to pharmacies and for certain transactions involving prescriptions related to pharmacy benefits managers pbm s 
the company also has a shared savings based arrangement with one payor sponsor under which it earns fees for improvements in a pocketscript user s prescribing behavior relative to that sponsoring payor s customers 
while increasing the number of active users should increase the prescriptions written and thus increase the potential for transaction fees under current agreements  substantial revenue increases from transaction fees will require additional transaction based fees from new and existing customers 
the company is seeking such agreements with interested parties 
the source of new transaction related fees the company is most focused on are payors  both existing and new customers that sponsor e prescribing programs  and other payors that have insured members visiting doctors that already use the pocketscript service via a sponsorship arrangement from another competing payor 
in most cases  there are multiple payors in each market and the additional non sponsorship payors are viewed as potential sources for additional fees in return for certain services such as formulary display  drug to drug interaction checking and reporting 
other possible sources for additional transaction fees are from other parties who could benefit from a real time  electronic connectivity with pocketscript users 
the number of prescriptions written using the pocketscript service and thus transmitted through the zixdata center has been growing on a year over year basis 
in  the company transacted approximately  prescriptions compared to  prescriptions in the company is investing greater sales effort and post deployment attention to maximizing utilization in order to maximize future revenue potential both through renewals and transaction fees 
the company believes that the sponsorship model is currently the prevalent market demand model 
continued growth in this area will require additional payor sponsors or a change in the market demand model and increased revenues from transaction fees or the equivalent 
cost of revenues the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the company s cost of revenues by product line 
the company s two product lines segments  email encryption and e prescribing  have direct cost of revenues  which are readily identifiable between the two product lines in in and the costs were less identifiable  however  management made estimates and assumptions to calculate an estimated cost of revenues per product line throughout and those estimates and assumptions are provided here for comparative purposes

table of contents occupancy costs of  stock based compensation costs of  and other sundry costs of  the company s occupancy costs are allocated on a regular basis and based on headcount associated with cost of revenues  research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company s total occupancy costs have decreased between the comparable years of and due to the combined effects of the reduction in workforce and the divestitures of the mi wi and dr 
chart product lines 
however  the headcount reductions in cost of revenues resulting from these events have been proportionally less than those reductions in the research development and selling  general and administrative expense classifications 
this disproportionate reduction in headcount has resulted in a higher allocation of occupancy costs to cost of revenues 
the increase in stock based compensation costs are due to the adoption of sfas r see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the reductions in personnel costs and travel expenses between years and resulted principally from selected headcount reductions in both email encryption and e prescribing segments stemming from the reduction in workforce and the divestitures of the mi wi and dr 
chart product lines 
the reduction in depreciation expense is due to the divestitures previously mentioned  the effects of previously recorded impairments on certain fixed assets and other certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated 
the reduced amortization expense of intangible assets resulted from the write down of certain intangible assets also related to the divestitures of the mi wi and dr 
chart product lines 
email encryption email encryption s cost of revenues is comprised of costs related to operating and maintaining the zixdata center  a field deployment team  customer service and support and the amortization of company owned  customer based computer appliances 
for email encryption  a significant portion of the total cost of revenues relates to the zixdata center  which is currently not fully utilized 
accordingly  cost of revenues is relatively fixed in nature and is expected to grow at a slower pace than revenue 
the  increase for year compared to year is primarily from an increase in the related zixdata center costs that were previously dedicated to divested products 
as those products were divested  the resources and computing assets were reassigned to support email encryption 
email encryption has shown the ability to grow revenues  while leaving cost of revenues flat or only marginally increasing as more efficient methods of product delivery and service have been implemented 
for example  the email encryption revenues for have increased  or  when compared to  but the  increase in cost of revenues is only higher than e prescribing e prescribing s cost of revenues is comprised of costs related to operating and maintaining the zixdata center  a field deployment team  customer service and support  training and e prescribing device costs 
in e prescribing  a greater proportion of total cost of revenues relates to the field deployment and device costs 
these are more variable in nature than the zixdata center and accordingly  e prescribing costs are more closely correlated with demand 
the  decrease in cost of revenues for total year compared to total year reflects a decrease of approximately  in fixed costs partially offset by an increase in variable costs of  which is primarily the cost of the handheld device 
the decrease in fixed costs is due principally to the divestiture activities previously discussed 
the increase in variable costs is primarily due from an increase in the number of new  billable deployments for which revenue could be recognized 
the new billable deployments in were approximately  compared to  in because e prescribing costs of revenues have a greater variable component  additional increases in e prescribing demand  as measured by revenue and deployments  is expected to result in a corresponding increase in the related cost of revenues 
for example  the e prescribing revenues for increased  when compared to as noted above  the variable cost component of total cost of revenues increased for the comparable period by approximately  divested products mi wi and dr

chart product lines and the discontinuance of the connect service   for pocketscript related costs of hand held devices  the latter of which was due to a combination of decreased volume of deployments between periods and a change in the contracts whereby incremental deployment costs are capitalized allowing the costs to be recognized over the service period to appropriately match related revenues  a  reduction in occupancy costs and  for outside consultants 
the decrease in personnel costs was due to the above mentioned divestures and or discontinuance of the stated product lines  partially offset by increases to expand and maintain the company s deployment and client services capabilities to support the order growth of the company s pocketscript products and services

the decrease was the result of higher spending in related to newly acquired products from business acquisitions 
following the acquisitions  the costs were significantly reduced by merging various initiatives into the core research and development spending and thus decreasing the overall costs of research and development 
additionally  spending was reduced as a result of the discontinuance of the connect product and the selling of message inspector and web inspector product lines in march and the dr

chart product lines and the discontinuance of the connect product  and non personnel costs totaling  consisting primarily of  for reduced consulting fees primarily relating to mydoconline products and  for the one time charge of in process research and development associated with the acquisition of mydoconline 
we expect research and development costs in to be less than the reported expenses in for two reasons one  the annualized savings resulting from the mid year reduction in workforce and other non headcount related cost reductions  which will be realized in portions of  and two  the company plans to maintain a relative flat headcount level throughout selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administration expenses decreased for when compared to the general trend of reduced selling  general and administrative expenses began in and continued in as the company consolidated various marketing initiatives in from previously acquired companies  divested previously acquired companies  and concerted its efforts to reduce overall company spending  the latter point being part of the reduction in workforce and related objectives to lower non people costs

personnel costs include salaries and wages  severance pay  contract labor  consulting services  benefits and recruitment 
the decrease in non personnel costs was due to  in various one time tax expense reductions relating to state sales tax and international indirect tax refunds and a reduction of state sales and use tax accrued   in reduced amortization costs of intangible assets associated with the divestitures of the mi wi and dr

by comparison  the interest expense in was  and in was  liquidity and capital resources overview due to the company s history of operating spending being in excess of customer receipts  liquidity has been and continues to be an item of particular focus for the company s management 
essential to liquidity is the ability of the company to meet its obligations as they become due and in the ordinary course of business 
over the long term  it is imperative that the company becomes cash flow positive from operations 
the company operates in developing and emerging markets for its products  which makes predicting future cash flows difficult 
in late and early  the company embarked on a strategy to focus on two areas of the business that it deemed as core to its success  these were email encryption and e prescribing 
these two areas were believed by the company to be the most promising of its line of business 
thus  commencing in late and continuing throughout  the company shut down the connect product  sold the message and web inspector products  sold the dr 
chart product and eliminated other non essential positions in the company 
also in  the company sought to significantly reduce its debt to a level where it would not materially impact the company s ability to conduct operations 
through debt repayments using a combination of cash and the company s common stock  the debt was reduced from  at the beginning of to  at the end of the year  excluding discounts and capital leases 
in  the company continued its focus on these two core areas of business  raised additional capital  retired the outstanding convertible promissory note payable  and implemented a cost reduction program to better align the company s cost structure to the near term revenue opportunities  all as outlined immediately below in june  the company retired its outstanding  convertible promissory note prior to maturity by using restricted cash paying an early payment premium of  plus accrued interest

net proceeds from the transaction were  the company announced in that it was in the process of reducing its quarterly spending through a reduction in workforce and reductions in non headcount related areas and that the targeted cost reductions would equal approximately reduction in quarterly spending when compared with the first quarter of at december   the company had implemented the majority of these cost reductions 
on february   the company and sanofi aventis us inc sanofi aventis  a successor in interest to aventis inc  agreed to restructure indebtedness owing under a promissory note in the original principal amount of  held by sanofi aventis 
the promissory note was originally issued by the company in january to aventis inc and subsequently transferred to sanofi aventis in conjunction with the acquisition by the company of certain assets and business of mydoconline  inc  an affiliate of aventis sa and a provider of secure web based communications  disease management  and laboratory information solutions 
the promissory note  payable in  cash or equivalently valued shares of the company s common stock  was due in full on march  pursuant to its agreements with sanofi aventis  the company satisfied its obligations under the original promissory note by means of i a prepayment on the original promissory note in the form of  unrestricted shares of the company s common stock  and ii following such prepayment  the delivery to sanofi aventis of the company s new secured promissory note in the original principal amount of  secured by a letter of credit  and the issuance of a five year warrant for  shares at an exercise price of per share 
the new promissory note is payable in eight quarterly installments of  each for an aggregate payment of  with the first payment due in april and the final payment due in january the new promissory note is fully secured by a letter of credit in favor of sanofi aventis and bears interest at the rate of 
interest payments are due quarterly commencing in april further  the value of the letter of credit will be automatically reduced as the company makes periodic principal payments to sanofi aventis 
the company has total contractual obligations over the next year of  and of  over the next three years consisting of debt obligations and other contractual commitments 
the amount due in the next year includes  in debt payments for a commercial insurance related promissory note that calls for monthly payments and expires in november 
the three year total also includes  of the total  promissory note issued to sanofi aventis as part of the restructured promissory note see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the remainder of the three year obligations consists primarily of rental obligations associated with the company s various facilities 
cash usage in excess of these commitments represents operating spending to satisfy existing customer contracts and cover various corporate overhead costs  as well as investments that the company chooses to make to secure new orders 
the company believes that a significant portion of the spending in excess of contractual commitments is discretionary and flexible 
the company is engaged in two primary markets email encryption and e prescribing previously known as esecure and ehealth  respectively 
both are subscription businesses that share a common business model 
first  the service is established and maintained  which requires a start up cost and recurring fixed costs 
subscribers are then acquired and brought onto the service  which requires a variable acquisition cost of selling and marketing  installation and deployment 
subscribers are recruited with the goal of reaching a level of subscriber payments that exceeds the fixed recurring service costs 
therefore  both the rate at which new subscribers are added and the ability to retain subscribers is essential to operational cash flow breakeven 
operationally  the future cash flow of the company is primarily dependent upon the following key metrics rate of new subscriptions termed new first year orders for the email encryption service renewal rates for the email encryption service new insurance payor sponsorships of the e prescribing service to physicians successful adoption and usage of the e prescribing service by physicians 
table of contents retention of the users physicians of the e prescribing service future transaction fees or related fees associated with the use of the e prescribing service the ability to increase the business volume with reasonable cost increases email encryption the recurring nature of the email encryption subscription model makes cash receipts naturally rise in a predictable manner assuming adequate subscription renewal and continued new additions to the subscription base 
adding to the predictability is the company s model of selling primarily three year subscription contracts for email encryption with the fees paid annually at the inception of each year of service 
for several years the spending in email encryption exceeded cash receipts 
as that business has matured  the gap between cash spending and cash receipts from operations narrowed substantially and in cash receipts from email encryption operations exceeded cash expenses attributable to email encryption 
this was accomplished by keeping costs relatively flat while continuing to book new first year orders approximately  in calendar year and  in  as well as maintaining a high customer renewal rate approximately for calendar years and of existing customers whose initial contracted service period had expired 
the company expects the email encryption business to continue generating cash receipts in excess of its specific operating costs in and beyond assuming continued addition of new subscribers at historical rates and maintaining consistent subscriber renewal rates 
e prescribing the e prescribing service and corresponding market is significantly earlier in its development phase when compared to email encryption  thus  the company has chosen to spend money in excess of the cash receipts to build an e prescribing subscription base with the target of reaching a level of subscribers required to overcome the spending needed to profitably provide the service 
the company currently estimates a range of  to  active users subscribers are needed for these fixed costs to be overcome 
as of december   the company had approximately  active subscribers using the e prescribing service 
at the end of  the company had seven payor sponsors under contract 
the company currently has the staff on hand to deploy units per quarter and has a backlog of approximately  sponsored  but not yet deployed units 
however  not all users to whom the e prescribing service is deployed become active 
additionally  the company continues to experience some attrition in its deployed and active user base 
finally  the company continues to review and target changes to its contracts  recruiting and training strategy in an effort to increase this performance rate 
most contracts renew on an annual basis 
our largest and original payor sponsor has continued to sponsor renewals for its affiliated and active users 
additionally  with several of the new payor sponsors originally contracted in approaching their respective renewal dates in  the company expects to improve its understanding in trends regarding retention rates for e prescribing  as those trends will cover a larger portion of the total customer base 
for those users not meeting the threshold of being considered active and thus not being eligible for continued sponsorship by a payor sponsor  the company attempts to execute a renewal contract directly with the individual user or medical practice 
the breakeven point to cover both fixed and variable costs will be strongly influenced by the volume of electronic prescriptions written and the success in negotiating additional and maintaining existing transaction based fee structures 
the transaction based fees  or usage fees  form an important part of the e prescribing breakeven point mentioned above 
the company has signed three contracts with transaction based fees or the equivalent with existing and new healthcare payors 
and  there is one payor contract that provides for a shared savings arrangement measured by improvements in prescribing behavior with one of the payor sponsors 
further  in most cases  there are multiple payors in each market and those additional non sponsorship payors are viewed as potential sources for additional fees in return for certain services such as formulary display  drug to drug interaction checking and reporting 
lastly  possible sources for additional transaction fees include parties who could benefit from a real time  electronic connectivity with pocketscript users 
for example  currently the company has contracts that allow it to bill fees for sending prescriptions electronically to the pharmacies and for certain transactions involving prescriptions related to pharmacy benefits managers pbm and a usage based arrangement

sources and uses of cash summary ending cash and cash equivalents on december  was  versus  on december  these balances exclude restricted cash of  at december   and  at december  restricted cash is not available for operations because of restrictions placed on that cash  primarily from placement of the cash in collateral accounts used to secure debt and make debt payments 
the following table shows various sources and uses of operating cash for and twelve months twelve months ended ended variance for december  december  the twelve month period operating cash receipts products existing on december  operating cash receipts products divested in customer deposit received net operating cash spending net cash used by operating activities for calendar year  the net cash used by operating activities improved  over the comparable period in overall  the email encryption service yielded positive cash flow from operations while e prescribing had negative cash flow from operations 
cash flow from operations is a management measurement computed from total cash receipts minus cost of revenues and direct costs  but excluding total unallocated expense income 
email encryption has seen year on year improvement in cash flow because of continued growth in new subscriptions and its high rate of customer renewals 
the company anticipates that year on year email encryption cash flow improvement should continue as long as new subscriptions and the rate of customer renewals are sustained 
the early stage market of e prescribing makes the expected cash usage for the company s e prescribing service in less predictable 
improved cash utilization for the e prescribing service is dependent upon securing new payor sponsorships  experiencing adequate renewal rates of existing users and increasing the sources of cash from transaction and performance based fees 
the company announced in that it was in the process of reducing its quarterly spending through a reduction in workforce and reductions in non headcount related areas and that the targeted cost reductions would equal approximately reduction in quarterly spending when compared with the first quarter of at december   the company had implemented the majority of these cost reductions

on february   the company and sanofi aventis agreed to restructure certain indebtedness of the company to sanofi aventis 
a company promissory note held by sanofi aventis  payable in  cash or equivalently valued shares of the company s common stock  was due in full on march  pursuant to its agreements with sanofi aventis  the company satisfied its obligations under the original promissory note in part by means of delivering to sanofi aventis the company s new secured promissory note in the original principal amount of  the new promissory note is payable in eight quarterly installments of  each for an aggregate payment of  with the first payment due in april and the final payment due in january the new promissory note is fully secured by a letter of credit in favor of sanofi aventis and bears interest at the rate of 
the company has deposited  into a certificate of deposit with the bank issuing the letter of credit  and as a result  will report the deposit as a form of restricted cash throughout the life of the financial instrument 
as the company makes periodic principal payments to sanofi aventis  the value of the letter of credit and corresponding cash balance in restricted cash will be reduced accordingly 
further  interest payments are due quarterly commencing in april cash sources the following items are essential to the company s future operating cash sources contractual backlog email encryption growth and retention e prescribing growth and retention e prescribing transaction and performance based fees backlog the company s end user order backlog of  is comprised of contractually bound customer agreements that are expected to be amortized into revenue as services are provided in the future 
the majority of these contracts are time based subscription contracts with billings in advance of annual service periods 
most customers elect to commit to multiple years of service and are invoiced annually 
the backlog is comprised of  of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid and  that has either not yet been billed or has been billed  but not collected in cash as of december  the company estimates that approximately half of the amount not yet billed will be billed in the next twelve months 

table of contents email encryption growth and retention the company collected cash receipts of  in the twelve months ended december  the company estimates cash receipts from email encryption in will be approximately  the company assumes it will collect contractually billed amounts  experience continued high renewal rates  new first year orders at the same rate demonstrated in  continued growth in its oem channels and new product related order activities 
the company believes that the anticipated increase in cash receipts can be achieved with minimal additional costs 
e prescribing growth and retention the company s go to market model in e prescribing has been to contract with healthcare payors who pay the company to provide service to physicians for at least one year 
the company believes that this model is the most cost effective method of addressing the market in large quantities at this time 
the company has demonstrated selling and deployment success with this model with seven major insurance payors 
the company s current list price for the first year of the service is  which includes twelve months of service as well as set up fees  and a per year fee for service in subsequent years 
the company currently has a usage based arrangement with one of the payor sponsors  which provides for the payment of fees to the company based on achievement of measured improvements in prescribing behavior 
in light of the relatively low margins on installation and service during the initial year of deployment  the company s ability to promote high utilization rates for each prescriber  and thus  to increase the likelihood of renewals and the generation of transaction fees  is an important aspect of the company s cash flow breakeven plan for e prescribing 
e prescribing transaction and performance based fees the company s go to market model in e prescribing also involves securing additional contracts where customers pay for various transactions that occur through the e prescribing service 
for example  the company has contracts with pharmacy benefit managers and one electronic prescription aggregator for prescriptions that are fulfilled through their system 
during  the company received an average of to cents per script 
in  several of these contracts will undergo renewal and or renegotiation  and the company is unsure that the historical cash generation involving these specific customers can be maintained 
the company has signed three contracts with transaction based fees or the equivalent with existing and new healthcare payors 
further  in most cases  there are multiple payors in each market and those additional non sponsorship payors are viewed as potential sources for additional fees in return for certain services such as formulary display  drug to drug interaction checking and reporting 
possible sources for additional transaction fees include parties who could benefit from a real time  electronic connectivity with pocketscript users 
securing further transaction and performance based revenue streams in excess of those currently under contract will be required so that the previously discussed targeted range of  to  active physician will provide returns in excess of fixed costs of providing the e prescribing service 
cash requirements while the contractual commitments of the company as of december   are relatively low in comparison to historical cash used from operations  the company anticipates further net cash usage from operations over the next twelve months 
the company s cash requirements consist principally of the company s contractual commitments  funding its operating losses as it maintains a leadership position in the emerging market in which it operates  and capital expenditures 
the latter of which primarily involves computer equipment to support new email encryption customer orders and  over time  ongoing refurbishment of the data center and customer located email encryption computer equipment 
the company s cash requirements beyond contractual commitments are primarily aimed at continued investment in the e prescribing business 
the company has acquisition costs associated with adding subscribers to both the email encryption and e prescribing services 
for email encryption  the costs are primarily selling and marketing  while for e prescribing the costs are primarily recruitment and deployment related  including hardware device costs 
in the first year of the service  the company generally targets fees from the customer that cover the majority of the incremental acquisition costs 
after the first year of service  the incremental cost to support customers decreases significantly  which increases the variable cash contribution to the company as each contract matures 
in addition  net cash contributions from transaction based fees are high relative to the incremental costs to generate these fees 
in  the company deployed the e prescribing service to approximately  prescribers for a quarterly average of approximately deployments 
future quarters with deployments greater than these quantities will equate to greater variable costs offset with greater cash receipts from the sponsors and lower deployments versus this current run rate would equate to lower variable costs and cash receipts than recently experienced 

table of contents the company is projecting its operating spending to be approximately  inclusive of capital equipment purchases for the next twelve months from december  this projection is based on the company s organization size after taking into account the effects of the cost reduction program  the current order and deployment rates and the annualized operating spending 
see liquidity summary below 
liquidity summary the company s publicly announced goal for total cash includes cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash at december   is  the underlying assumptions for this goal are as of december   unrestricted cash on hand was cash receipts for the next twelve months are projected to be approximately  based on current contracted billings and estimated contract renewals and new business 
operating spending plus capital asset purchases for the next twelve months is projected to be approximately  based upon the company s organization  cost reduction actions previously mentioned and order and deployment rates as of december   based on the foregoing assumptions and projections  the company believes it has adequate resources and liquidity to sustain operations for the next twelve months  beginning january  of the  goal   will be restricted cash resulting from the issuance of a letter of credit associated with the subsequent event announced on february   and involving the restructuring of the aventis promissory note indebtedness 
there are no assurances that the company will ultimately achieve or achieve in a timely manner these levels of projected cash receipts or expenses 
should business results not occur as projected  the company may not achieve these projections 
it would have to alter its business plan or further augment its cash flow position through cost reduction measures  sales of assets  additional financings or a combination of these actions to achieve its december  total cash or equivalents goal 
however  there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in carrying out any of these measures should they become necessary 
the company has expressed a lack of willingness  relative to other alternatives  to raise capital by issuing new shares of common stock given the current price of the company s common stock
