item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december   and the related notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada 
reference to note to the consolidated financial statements should be made for a discussion of differences between canadian and united states gaap and their effect on the financial statements 
all amounts stated herein are in us dollars  unless otherwise noted 
overview we are engaged in the evaluation  acquisition  exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects with the aim of adding value to the projects 
our approach to acquisitions of gold projects has generally been to seek projects within political jurisdictions with well established mining  land ownership and tax laws  which have adequate drilling and geological data to support the completion of a third party review of the geological data and to complete an estimate of the mineralized material 
in addition  we look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects through exploration drilling or introducing technological innovations 
we expect that emphasis on gold project acquisition and improvement will continue in the future 
our holdings include the maverick springs  mountain view  hasbrouck  three hills and wildcat projects and the hycroft mine  all in nevada  the long valley project in east central california  the yellow pine project in idaho  the paredones amarillos and the guadalupe de los reyes projects in mexico  the amayapampa project in bolivia  the mt 
todd gold mine in australia  the awak mas project in indonesia  and the fw lewis  inc properties located in nevada and colorado 
we also own approximately of the shares of zamora gold corp  a company exploring for gold in ecuador 
in september  we entered into the arrangement agreement with carl pescio  janet pescio and our wholly owned subsidiary  allied nevada  pursuant to which the parties agreed to undertake a transaction that would result in our transfer of our nevada based mining properties and related assets into allied nevada and the pescios transfer to allied nevada of their interests in certain nevada based mining properties and related assets  all to be carried out pursuant to an arrangement 
see item business significant developments in entry into arrangement and merger agreement for proposed transfer of nevada assets and concurrent acquisition of nevada assets held by pescios 
outlook gold prices started at per ounce and finished the year at per ounce as quoted on the london exchange 
this rise of approximately during the year reflected factors such as rising oil prices  global instability  real and threatened terrorism activities  the war in iraq  and the rise and demand for investment and jewelry 
current prices are at a year high and no assurance can be given that such prices will be sustained 
at the end of  we owned or controlled thirteen properties containing mineralized material 
we expect that emphasis on gold project acquisition will continue in the future 
in addition  through exploration drilling and engineering studies  we believe that additional value can be added to most of the projects by advancing them closer to a production decision 
we do not currently generate operating cash flows 
subject to sustained gold prices  we expect to generate revenues and cash flows in the future 
we may generate revenues and cash flows from our portfolio of gold projects by several means  including but not limited to options or leases to third parties  joint venture arrangements with other gold producers  outright sales for cash and or royalties  or project development and operation 
with respect to our current property holdings  aggregate expenditures for purchase installments  to maintain options and conduct exploration activities are currently anticipated being approximately  in and  in including  for both and  with respect to our nevada properties that we currently hold but anticipate transferring to allied nevada assuming completion of the arrangement transaction described above 
at present  we would anticipate raising funds to meet these long term obligations through equity private placements  or joint venture efforts or sale of properties currently controlled 
in subsequent years  we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to meet property purchase installment obligations and scheduled payments on those properties that we decide to retain under option 
further  additional capital would be necessary to acquire properties and conduct exploration drilling and re engineering studies on current and newly acquired properties 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in efforts to raise additional capital 
results from operations summary our consolidated net loss was million or per share compared to the consolidated net loss of million or per share for a net decrease of million 
the decrease of million in is primarily due to increased interest income of million resulting from an increase in interest earned on our liquid bank account and the hycroft restricted cash account  partially offset by increased corporate administration and investor relations costs of million 
as compared to a consolidated net loss of million or per share in  the consolidated net loss decreased by million 
the decrease in is primarily due to decreased stock based compensation expense of million resulting from fewer stock option grants during as compared to and increased interest income of million due to increased investment in our liquid savings account  partially offset by increased exploration and property evaluation costs of million and increased general and administrative costs of million 
gold production and revenue the hycroft mine is on care and maintenance 
mining activities were suspended at hycroft in and  as expected  gold production has ceased 
effective at the beginning of fiscal  gold production was considered incidental to the activities at the hycroft mine and reporting the associated sales proceeds as revenue was no longer warranted 
accordingly  gold revenues in  and therefore were nil 
recorded  and production costs are therefore nil 
exploration  property evaluation and holding costs exploration  property evaluation and holding costs increased to  during the year ended december   compared with  for the same period in the principal variances from the year are as follows an increase in holding costs at the hycroft mine of an increase in holding costs at the amayapampa mine of an increase in holding costs for the awak mas project of a decrease in general development costs of  and a decrease in holding costs at the paredones amarillos project of  as well  we incurred holding costs of  and  with respect to the mt 
todd gold mine and the fw lewis  inc properties  neither of which had any costs associated with them during exploration  property evaluation and holding costs increased to  during the year ended december   compared with  for the same period in the principal variances from are as follows an increase in holding costs at the paredones amarillos project of  an increase in general development costs of  a decrease in holding costs at the hycroft mine of  and a decrease in holding costs at the amayapampa mine of as well  we incurred holding costs of  with respect to the awak mas project which was not among our property holdings in corporate administration and investor relations corporate administration and investor relations costs increased to  during the year ended december   compared to  in the principal variances pertaining to the comparative twelve month period in are as follows during  we paid  to an outside consultant  to assist with our compliance with internal control over financial reporting and related requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act of during  we expensed loan fees of  that were held as prepaid items as of december  these loan fees were associated with the non binding term sheet for a bridge credit facility that we had entered into in december during  audit and tax fees increased  as compared to the increase is mostly due to additional audit fees related to requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act of during  compliance fees increased  as compared to the increase is mostly due to increased regulatory filing fees due to increased regulatory filings throughout the year 
the remaining variance can be attributed to higher labor costs in as compared with  which is partially offset by decreased investor relations costs in due to a mass mailing that was completed during corporate administration and investor relations costs increased to  during the year ended december   compared to  in  representing an increase of  this increase is primarily the result of a more comprehensive investor relations program that included a mass mailing campaign during depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was approximately  in   in and  in in each case  there was no significant change in the depreciation and amortization costs from the previous year 
stock based compensation stock based compensation increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the the increase of  is mostly due to the following during   stock options were issued to employees and directors of vista gold corp 
which resulted in an increase to stock compensation expense of  for the immediately vested portion 
during   stock options were issued to employees of vista gold corp 
which resulted in an increase to stock compensation expense of  for the immediately vested portion 
during  compensation expense associated with stock options issued in prior periods was  as compared to  for stock based compensation decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the decrease of  is mostly due to granting of  stock options with a recorded fair value expense of  during as compared to the granting of  stock options with a recorded fair value expense of  on january   we retroactively adopted  without restatement of prior years  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  cica this standard requires that we record compensation expense on the granting of all stock based compensation awards  including stock option grants to employees  calculated using the fair value method 
the adoption of the fair value method resulted in a cumulative increase of  to the opening deficit at january  and increases of  and  to common share capital and stock options  respectively  at january  previously we recorded only those expenses associated with stock options granted to non employees based upon the fair value on the earlier date of completion of performance or vesting of the options granted 
we did not record any compensation cost on grants of stock options to employees and directors prior to january  other income and expenses loss gain on disposal of marketable securities in  we realized a gain on disposal of marketable securities of  compared to a gain of  in in  we realized a gain on disposal of marketable securities of  compared to a loss of  in at december   we held marketable securities available for sale with a book value of  we purchased the securities for investing purposes with the intent to hold the securities until such time that it would be advantageous to sell the securities at a gain 
although there can be no reasonable assurance that a gain will be realized from the sale of the securities  we monitor the market status of the securities consistently in order to mitigate the risk of loss on the investment 
gain on disposal of assets there were no gains from the disposal of assets recorded during net gains of  on disposal of assets were recorded in as compared to net gains of  in  in both cases resulting from the sale of equipment at the hycroft mine 
interest income and expense during   and  we did not incur any interest expense as we had no commercial debt during these years 
during the respective years ended december   and  we realized   and  in interest income 
the increases are the result of an increase in interest earned on our liquid savings account and the hycroft restricted cash account  as follows during the year ended december   interest earned on our liquid savings account was  and interest earned on the hycroft restricted cash account was  during the year ended december   interest earned on our liquid savings account was  and interest earned on the hycroft restricted cash account was  during the year ended december   interest earned on our liquid savings account was  and interest earned on the hycroft restricted cash account was  for both and  the increased interest earned on our liquid savings account can be attributed to higher cash balances that became available to be invested during the respective periods due to private placement financings and stock option and warrant exercises 
for  the increase in interest earned on the hycroft restricted cash account is attributable to higher interest rates attained during for  the increase is due to a higher cash balance throughout the year subject to interest as compared to when we were making payments to the account and less money was available to earn interest 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources cash used in operations net cash used in operating activities was level with million in  and in each case  there was no significant change in the cash used in operations from the previous year 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million in and million in the decrease of million in can be attributed to a decrease of million for the acquisitions of subsidiaries net of cash  reflecting the cash expended as partial consideration for the acquisition of the mt 
todd gold mine for million in as compared to the acquisition of the awak mas project for million  and million cash expended as partial consideration for the acquisition of f 
w 
lewis  inc properties in this decrease is offset by an increase in property expenditures during of million 
the increase of million in can be attributed primarily to an increase of million for the acquisitions of subsidiaries net of cash  reflecting the acquisition of the awak mas project for million  and million cash expended as partial consideration for the acquisition of fw lewis  inc properties in  which was offset by a decrease of million due to expenditures for the restricted cash account that was established in and a decrease of million due to a premium payment in for the hycroft reclamation bond 
financing activities we received net cash from financing activities of million in compared to net cash provided from financing activities of million in and million in the increase of million for prepaid acquisition costs in as compared to and is due to costs incurred in connection with the proposed arrangement see other entry into arrangement and merger agreement for proposed transfer of nevada assets and concurrent acquisition of nevada assets held by pescios

significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant areas requiring the use of estimates include mine closure and reclamation obligations  useful lives for asset depreciation purposes  impairment of mineral properties and stock based compensation 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
mineral properties mineral property acquisition costs and exploration costs are recorded at cost and are deferred until the viability of the property is determined 
general overhead  administrative and holding costs to maintain a property on a care and maintenance basis are expensed in the period they are incurred 
if a project would be put into production  capitalized costs would be depleted on the unit of production basis 
option payments and reimbursements received are treated as a recovery of mineral property costs 
option payments are at the discretion of the optionee and accordingly are accounted for on a cash basis or when receipt is reasonably assured 
our management regularly reviews the net carrying value of each mineral property 
where information and conditions suggest impairment  estimated future cash flows are calculated using estimated future prices  proven and probable reserves  weighted probable outcomes and operating capital and reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis 
if it is determined that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  a write down to the estimated fair value is made with a charge to loss for the period 
where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment  management assesses if carrying values can be recovered 
asset retirement obligation and closure costs the fair value of a liability for our legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets is recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset unless the asset has been previously written off  in which case the amount is expensed 
the fair value of the legal obligation for asset retirement is assessed at the end of each reporting period 
where we have an insurance policy in place to cover changes in the legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets which have previously been expensed  increased to the fair value of such obligations are recognized at the end of the period with a corresponding amount recorded as an amount recoverable from the insurance company 
stock based compensation and other stock based payments on january   the corporation retroactively adopted  without restatement of prior years  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  cica this standard requires that the corporation record compensation expense on the granting of all stock based compensation awards  including stock options grants to employees  calculated using the fair value method 
the adoption of the fair value method resulted in a cumulative increase of  to the opening deficit at january   and increases of  and  to common share capital and stock options  respectively  at january  previously  the corporation recorded only those expenses associated with stock options granted to non employees and directors prior to january  when an employee or non employee exercises stock options  then the fair value of the options on the date of the grant is transferred to common stock 
when options are forfeited then the vested fair value balance of the stock options is transferred to contributed surplus  while any unvested portions are reversed out accordingly 
when options expire  the related fair value is transferred to contributed surplus 
deferred stripping costs in october  the cica emerging issues committee eic issued for comment a draft abstract  eic d accounting for deferred stripping costs in the mining industry 
if adopted  this eic would require stripping costs to be accounted for as variable production costs to be included in inventory unless the stripping activity can be shown to be a betterment of the mineral property  in which case the stripping costs would be capitalized 
a betterment occurs when stripping activity increases future output of the mine by providing access to additional sources of reserves 
capitalized stripping costs would be amortized on a units of production basis over the proven and probable reserves to which they relate 
as of december  we did not have any deferred stripping costs 
should eic d be adopted  we will continue to defer stripping costs of major mine expansions which allow us to mine reserves not previously included in the reserve base 
in  we do not expect to defer any costs associated with mine expansion 
non monetary transactions cica handbook section non monetary transactions will be applicable to us commencing with the financial year 
reporting of the corporation s results is not expected to be materially effected by this standard 
derivative instruments in january  the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica issued three new standards relating to financial instruments 
these standards are applicable for fiscal years beginning on or after october  the corporation is currently reviewing the impact of these new standards 
these standards are as follows financial instruments recognition and measurement  section this standard prescribes when a financial asset  financial liability  or non financial derivative is to be recognized on the balance sheet and whether fair value or cost based measures are used 
it also specifies how financial instrument gains and losses are to be presented 
hedges  section this standard is applicable when a company chooses to designate a hedging relationship for accounting purposes 
it builds on the existing accounting guideline acg hedging relationships  and section foreign currency translation  by specifying how hedge accounting is applied and what disclosures are necessary when it is applied 
comprehensive income  section this standard introduces new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income 
comprehensive income  which is currently reported under us gaap  is the change in shareholders equity net assets of an enterprise during a reporting period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources 
it includes changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners 
these items include minimum pension liability adjustments  holding gains and losses on certain investments  gains and losses on certain derivative instruments and foreign currency gains and losses related to self sustaining foreign operations cumulative translation adjustment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are engaged in the acquisition of gold projects and related activities including exploration engineering  permitting and the preparation of feasibility studies 
the value of our properties is related to gold price and changes in the price of gold could affect our ability to generate revenue from our portfolio of gold projects 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time and are affected by numerous factors  including the following expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  exchange rates  interest rates  global and regional political and economic circumstances and governmental policies  including those with respect to gold holdings by central banks 
the demand for  and supply of  gold affect gold prices  but not necessarily in the same manner as demand and supply affect the prices of other commodities 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of new mine production and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments  public and private financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
the demand for gold primarily consists of jewelry and investments 
additionally  hedging activities by producers  consumers  financial institutions and individuals can affect gold supply and demand 
while gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world  its market value cannot be predicted for any particular time 
because we have several exploration operations in north america and south america  australia and in asia  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not engage in currency hedging to offset any risk of currency fluctuations as insignificant monetary amounts are held for immaterial land holding costs related to the properties owned 
we have no debt outstanding  nor do we have any investment in debt instruments other than highly liquid short term investments 
accordingly  we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be insignificant at this time
