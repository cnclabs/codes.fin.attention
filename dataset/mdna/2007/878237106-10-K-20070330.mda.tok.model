item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a asset management 
while we sell products in various countries throughout the world  and product categories may vary from region to region  during fiscal  sales within our consolidated product categories approximated the following peripherals systems networking software we generated approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal from products purchased from hp compared to  and of consolidated net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
there were no other vendors that accounted for or more of our consolidated net sales in fiscal  or customers and services we purchase products directly from manufacturers and publishers in large quantities for sale to an active reseller base of more than  vars  direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers 
while we sell products in various countries throughout the world  and customer channels may vary from region to region  during fiscal  sales within our consolidated customer channels approximated the following vars direct marketers and retailers corporate resellers no single customer accounted for more than five percent of our net sales during fiscal  or the market for vars is attractive because vars generally rely on distributors as their principal source of computer products and financing 
this reliance is due to vars typically lacking the resources to establish a large number of direct purchasing relationships or stock significant product inventories 
direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers may establish direct relationships with manufacturers and publishers for their more popular products  but utilize distributors as the primary source for other product requirements and the alternative source for products acquired directly 
we have also developed special programs to meet the unique needs of direct marketers and retailers 
in addition to a strong product offering  we provide resellers a high level of customer service through our training and technical support  suite of electronic commerce tools including internet order entry and edi services  customized shipping documents  product configuration integration services and access to flexible financing programs 
we also provide services to our vendors by giving them the opportunity to participate in a number of special promotions  and marketing services targeted to the needs of our resellers 
while we believe that services such as these help to set us apart from our competition  they contribute less than to our overall revenues 
we provide our vendors with one of the largest bases of resellers throughout the americas and europe  delivering products to customers from our regionally located logistics centers 
we have located our logistics centers near our customers which enables us to deliver products on a timely basis  thereby reducing the customers need to invest in inventory see also item properties for further discussion of our locations and logistics centers 
sales and electronic commerce our sales force consists of field and inside telemarketing sales representatives 
our sales force is provided comprehensive training regarding our policies and procedures and technical characteristics of our products 
these training programs are supplemented by product seminars offered by manufacturers and publishers 
field sales representatives are located in major metropolitan areas 
each field sales representative is supported by inside telemarketing sales teams covering a designated territory 
our team concept provides a strong personal relationship between our customers representatives and tech data 
territories with no field representation are serviced exclusively by the inside telemarketing sales teams 
customers typically call our inside sales teams on dedicated toll free numbers or contact us through various electronic methods to place orders 
if the product is in stock and the customer has available credit  customer orders are generally shipped the same day from the logistics center nearest the customer or the intended end user 

table of contents increasingly  customers rely upon our electronic ordering and information systems  in addition to our product catalogs and frequent mailings  as sources for product information  including availability and price 
our on line computer systems allow the inside sales teams to check current stocking levels in the company s logistics centers 
through our website  most customers can gain remote access to our information systems to check product availability and pricing and to place orders 
certain of our larger customers have edi services available whereby orders  order acknowledgments  invoices  inventory status reports  customized pricing information and other industry standard edi transactions are consummated on line  which improves efficiency and timeliness for ourselves and our customers 
during fiscal  approximately billion of our consolidated net sales originated from orders received electronically  compared to approximately billion in fiscal and approximately billion in fiscal competition we operate in a market characterized by intense competition  based upon such factors as product availability  credit availability  price  delivery and various services and support provided by the distributor to the customer 
we believe that we are well equipped to compete effectively with other distributors in all of these areas 
we compete against several distributors in the americas market  including ingram micro inc  synnex corp  and several regional and local distributors 
the competitive environment within europe is highly fragmented  with market share spread among many regional and local competitors such as actebis group  and international distributors such as ingram micro inc and westcon comstor 
we also compete  in some cases  with manufacturers and publishers who sell directly to resellers and end users 
however  we may become a business partner to these companies by providing supply chain or other services tailored to the it market 
we believe manufacturers and publishers will generally continue to sell their products through distributors rather than directly due to our ability to provide suppliers with access to our broad customer base in a highly efficient manner 
our network of logistics centers and our sales and product management expertise worldwide allow our suppliers to benefit by lowering their selling and inventory costs 
employees on january   we had approximately  employees 
certain of our employees in various countries outside of the united states are subject to laws providing representation rights to employees on workers councils 
we consider relations with our employees to be good 
foreign and domestic operations and export sales we operate predominately in a single industry segment as a distributor of it products  logistics management  and other value added services 
while we operate primarily in one industry  because of our global presence  we manage our business based on our geographic segments 
our geographic segments include the americas including the united states  canada  latin america and export sales to the caribbean and europe  formerly referred to as emea including europe  the middle east and export sales to africa 
in fiscal  and    and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales were derived from operations outside of the united states 
over the past several years  we have entered new markets  expanded our presence in existing markets and exited certain markets based upon our assessment of  among other factors  risk and earnings potential 
we continue to evaluate our risk exposure eg  risks surrounding currency rates  regulatory environments  political instability  etc 
and earnings potential around the world 
to the extent we decide to close additional operations  we may incur charges and operating losses related to such closures or recognize a portion of our accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a non operating foreign currency exchange gain or loss see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the geographical distribution of our net sales  operating loss income  depreciation and amortization  capital expenditures  identifiable assets and goodwill

item a 
risk factors the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
before you buy our common stock or other securities  you should know that making such an investment involves risks  including the risks described below 
the risks that have been highlighted below are not the only risks of our business 
if any of the risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock or other securities could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
certain risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements include the following competition the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the computer wholesale distribution industry is characterized by intense competition  based primarily on product availability  credit availability  price  speed of delivery  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality and depth of product lines and training  service and support 
weakness in demand in the market intensifies the competitive environment in which the company operates 
the company competes with a variety of regional  national and international wholesale distributors  some of which have greater financial resources than the company 
the company also faces competition from companies entering or expanding into the logistics and product fulfillment and e commerce supply chain services market 
narrow profit margins as a result of intense price competition in the industry  the company has narrow gross profit and operating profit margins 
these narrow margins magnify the impact on operating results attributed to variations in sales and operating costs 
future gross profit and operating margins may be adversely affected by changes in product mix  vendor pricing actions and competitive and economic pressures 
in addition  failure to attract new sources of business from expansion of products or services or entry into new markets may adversely affect future gross profit and operating margins 
dependence on information systems the company is highly dependent upon its internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate its business 
there can be no assurance that the company s information systems will not fail or experience disruptions  that the company will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the operation of such systems  that the company will be able to expand and improve its information systems  that the company will be able to convert to new systems efficiently  or that the company will be able to integrate new programs effectively with its existing programs 
any of such problems could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
acquisitions as part of its growth strategy  the company pursues the acquisition of companies that either complement or expand its existing business 
as a result  the company regularly evaluates potential acquisition opportunities  which may be material in size and scope 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including expansion into new geographic markets and business areas  the requirement to understand local business practices  the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations 
table of contents and personnel of the acquired companies  the possible requirement to upgrade the acquired companies management information systems to the company s standards  potential adverse short term effects on the company s operating results and the amortization or impairment of any acquired intangible assets 
exposure to natural disasters  war  and terrorism the company s headquarters facilities and some of its logistics centers as well as certain vendors and customers are located in areas prone to natural disasters such as floods  hurricanes  tornadoes  or earthquakes 
in addition  demand for the company s services is concentrated in major metropolitan areas 
adverse weather conditions  major electrical failures or other natural disasters in these major metropolitan areas may disrupt the company s business should its ability to distribute products be impacted by such an event 
the company operates in multiple geographic markets  several of which may be susceptible to acts of war and terrorism 
the company s business could be adversely affected should its ability to distribute products be impacted by such events 
the company and many of its suppliers receive parts and products from asia and operate in many parts of the world that may be susceptible to disease or epidemic that may disrupt the company s ability to receive or deliver products or other disruptions in operations 
dependence on independent shipping companies the company relies on arrangements with independent shipping companies  such as federal express and united parcel service  for the delivery of its products from vendors and to customers 
the failure or inability of these shipping companies to deliver products  or the unavailability of their shipping services  even temporarily  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company may also be adversely affected by an increase in freight surcharges due to rising fuel costs and added security 
there can be no assurance that tech data will be able to pass along the full effect of an increase in these surcharges to its customers 
labor strikes the company s labor force is currently non union with the exception of employees of certain european and latin american subsidiaries  which are subject to collective bargaining or similar arrangements 
the company does business in certain foreign countries where labor disruption is more common than is experienced in the united states and some of the freight carriers used by the company are unionized 
a labor strike by a group of the company s employees  one of the company s freight carriers  one of its vendors  a general strike by civil service employees  or a governmental shutdown could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
many of the products the company sells are manufactured in countries other than the countries in which the company s logistics centers are located 
the inability to receive products into the logistics centers because of government action or labor disputes at critical ports of entry may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
risk of declines in inventory value the company is subject to the risk that the value of its inventory will decline as a result of price reductions by vendors or technological obsolescence 
it is the policy of most of the company s vendors to protect distributors from the loss in value of inventory due to technological change or the vendors price reductions 
some vendors  however  may be unwilling or unable to pay the company for price protection claims or products returned to them under purchase agreements 
moreover  industry practices are sometimes not embodied in written agreements and do not protect the company in all cases from declines in inventory value 
no assurance can be given that such practices to protect distributors will continue  that unforeseen new product developments will not adversely affect the company  or that the company will be able to successfully manage its existing and future inventories 
product availability the company is dependent upon the supply of products available from its vendors 
the industry is characterized by periods of severe product shortages due to vendors difficulties in projecting demand for certain products distributed by the company 
when such product shortages occur  the company typically receives an allocation of product from the vendor 
there can be no assurance that vendors will be able to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill all of the company s customer orders on a timely basis 
failure to obtain adequate product supplies could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
vendor terms and conditions the company relies on various rebates  cash discounts  and cooperative marketing programs offered by its vendors to support expenses associated with distributing and marketing the vendors products 
currently  the rebates and purchase discounts offered 
table of contents by vendors are influenced by sales volumes and percentage increases in sales  and are subject to changes by the vendors 
additionally  certain of the company s vendors subsidize floorplan financing arrangements for the benefit of our customers 
terminations of a supply or services agreement or a significant change in supplier terms or conditions of sale could negatively affect our operating margins  revenue or the level of capital required to fund our operations 
the company receives a significant percentage of revenues from products it purchases from relatively few manufacturers 
as has historically been the case  a manufacturer may make rapid  significant and adverse changes in its sales terms and conditions  such as reducing the amount of price protection and return rights as well as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to us  or may merge with or acquire other significant manufacturers 
the company s gross margins could be materially and negatively impacted if the company is unable to pass through the impact of these changes to the company s customers or cannot develop systems to manage ongoing supplier programs 
in addition  the company s standard vendor distribution agreement permits termination without cause by either party upon days notice 
the loss of a relationship with any of the company s key vendors  a change in their strategy such as increasing direct sales  the merging of significant manufacturers  or significant changes in terms on their products may adversely effect the company s business 
loss of significant customers customers do not have an obligation to make purchases from the company 
in some cases  the company has made adjustments to its systems  vendor offerings  and processes  and made staffing decisions  in order to accommodate the needs of a significant customer 
in the event a significant customer decides to make its purchases from another distributor  experiences a significant change in demand from its own customer base  becomes financially unstable  or is acquired by another company  the company s receipt of revenues may be significantly affected  resulting in an adverse effect on the company s business 
customer credit exposure the company sells its products to a large customer base of value added resellers  direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers 
the company finances a significant portion of such sales through trade credit 
as a result  the company s business could be adversely affected in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition of its customers  resulting in the customers inability to repay the company 
this risk may increase if there is a general economic downturn affecting a large number of the company s customers and in the event the company s customers do not adequately manage their business or properly disclose their financial condition 
need for liquidity and capital resources  fluctuations in interest rates the company s business requires substantial capital to operate and to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that are not financed by trade creditors 
the company has historically relied upon cash generated from operations  bank credit lines  trade credit from its vendors  proceeds from public offerings of its common stock and proceeds from debt offerings to satisfy its capital needs and finance growth 
the company utilizes various financing instruments such as receivables securitization  leases  revolving credit facilities and trade receivable purchase facilities 
as the financial markets change and new regulations come into effect  the cost of acquiring financing and the methods of financing may change 
changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital  or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs 
the inability to obtain such sources of capital could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s credit facilities contain various financial and other covenants that may limit the company s ability to borrow or limit the company s flexibility in responding to business conditions 
these financing instruments involve variable rate debt  thus exposing the company to risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
such fluctuations in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
foreign currency exchange risks  exposure to foreign markets the company conducts business in countries outside of the united states  which exposes the company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may enter into short term forward exchange or option contracts to hedge this risk  nevertheless  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
in particular  the value of the company s equity investment in foreign countries may fluctuate based upon changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these fluctuations  which are recorded in a cumulative translation adjustment account  may result in losses in the event a foreign subsidiary is sold or closed at a time when the foreign currency is weaker than when the company initially invested in the country 
the company s international operations are subject to other risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of certain technology  political instability  trade restrictions  tariff changes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of laws in particular related to items such as duty and taxation  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  longer collection periods and the impact of local economic conditions and practices 
there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s business 

table of contents changes in income tax and other regulatory legislation the company operates in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
when new legislation is enacted with minimal advance notice  or when new interpretations or applications of existing laws are made  the company may need to implement changes in its policies or structure 
in addition  recent legislation requires all member states of the european union to adopt the european directive ec regarding waste in electrical and electronic equipment weee directive and ec regarding restrictions of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive into national law 
the manner and timing of adoption of these laws impacts the company as  in some countries  it remains unclear to what extent and the manner in which the company will be subject to compliance with these regulations and the financial costs and guarantees thereby required 
the company makes plans for its structure and operations based upon existing laws and anticipated future changes in the law 
the company is susceptible to unanticipated changes in legislation  especially relating to income and other taxes  import export laws  hazardous materials and electronic waste recovery legislation  and other laws related to trade  accounting  and business activities 
such changes in legislation  both domestic and international  may have a significant adverse effect on the company s business 
changes in accounting rules the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  the public company accounting oversight board  the securities and exchange commission  the american institute of certified public accountants and various other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies or a new interpretation of an existing policy could have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before a change is announced 
volatility of common stock price because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  the company s participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the common stock price 
some of the factors that may affect the market price of the common stock  in addition to those discussed above  are changes in investment recommendations by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of competitors and key vendors  and fluctuations in the overall stock market  but particularly in the technology sector

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this annual report on form k  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  contains forward looking statements  as described in the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from those projected 
these forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of tech data corporation are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management 
words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance  our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses  and other characterizations of future events or circumstances  are forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
therefore  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
readers are referred to the cautionary statements and important factors discussed in item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k for the year ended january  for further information 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following competition narrow profit margins dependence on information systems acquisitions exposure to natural disasters  war and terrorism dependence on independent shipping companies labor strikes risk of declines in inventory value product availability vendor terms and conditions loss of significant customers customer credit exposure need for liquidity and capital resources  fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates  exposure to foreign markets changes in income tax and other regulatory legislation changes in accounting rules volatility of common stock price overview tech data is a leading distributor of information technology it products  logistics management and other value added services 
we distribute microcomputer hardware and software products to value added resellers  corporate resellers  direct marketers and retailers 
our offering of value added customer services includes training and technical support  external financing options  configuration services  outbound telemarketing  marketing services and a suite of electronic commerce solutions 
we manage our business in two geographic segments the americas including the united states  canada  latin america and export sales to the caribbean and europe  formerly referred to as emea including europe  the middle east and export sales to africa 
our strategy is to leverage our efficient cost structure combined with our multiple service offerings to generate demand and cost efficiencies for our suppliers and customers around the world 
the it distribution industry in which we operate is characterized by narrow gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin and narrow income from operations as a percentage of sales operating margin 
historically  our gross and operating margins have been impacted by intense price competition  as well as changes in terms and conditions with our suppliers  including those terms related to rebates and other incentives and price protection 
we expect 
table of contents these competitive pricing pressures to continue in the foreseeable future  and therefore  we will continue to evaluate our pricing policies and terms and conditions offered to our customers in response to changes in our vendors terms and conditions and the general market environment 
we will continue to focus on not only disciplined pricing and purchasing practices  but also on realigning our customer and vendor portfolio to support a sustainable higher margin business that will help drive long term profitability throughout all of our operations 
as we continue to evaluate our existing pricing policies and make future changes  if any  within our customer or vendor portfolio  we may experience moderated sales growth or sales declines 
in addition  increased competition and changes in general economic conditions within the markets in which we conduct business may hinder our ability to maintain and or improve gross margin from its current level 
from a balance sheet perspective  we require working capital primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we have historically relied upon debt  trade credit from our vendors  and accounts receivable financing programs for our working capital needs 
we believe our balance sheet at january  was one of the strongest in the industry  with a debt to capital ratio calculated as total debt divided by the aggregate of total debt and total shareholders equity of 
we continue to be satisfied with our performance over the last several years within the americas 
however  our profitability within europe has been well below our expectations 
we believe our lack of acceptable operating performance in europe was the result of a combination of factors  including weaker demand conditions in certain countries  competitive pricing pressures  declining average selling prices and  most notably  the diverted focus of our management team in the region 
specifically  the combined effect of the completion of our comprehensive it systems upgrade and harmonization project  further integration of our azlan operations and  most recently  the implementation of our european restructuring program initiated in may  diverted the focus of our management team in the region from executing appropriate pricing  purchasing and sales management practices 
in order to dedicate our strategic efforts and focus towards core growth opportunities  as well as our european turnaround  during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of our training business to a third party for total cash consideration of million  resulting in an after tax gain of million 
our results of operations for the training business and the gain on the sale of the training business have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations  net of tax in our consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
the reclassification of the training business had the effect of reducing previously reported gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of consolidated net sales by approximately 
to 
for fiscal and the impact on previously reported operating margin for these periods was relatively insignificant 
the assets and liabilities of the training business have not been reclassified in our january  consolidated balance sheet as the net assets of the training business were less than of the total consolidated net assets of the company 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our challenges in europe intensified 
during this quarter  we recorded sharply lower than expected revenues which we believe was the result of a further deceleration in it demand within europe  in comparison to previous quarters 
this deceleration in it demand during the quarter  particularly within western europe where the majority of our european revenue is derived  was a key factor leading to a heightened level of pricing pressure experienced within the region during the quarter 
this further deceleration in it demand and heightened pricing pressure  coupled with continued internal distractions of management related to the restructuring program  resulted in our european operating results for the quarter falling well short of our internal expectations 
as a result  we believed we had strong indicators of impairment of our goodwill in europe and  therefore  we performed an impairment test for goodwill as of july  this goodwill impairment analysis reflected the recast of both our short and longer term european financial outlook and resulted in our determination that a million non cash goodwill impairment charge was necessary as of july 
table of contents as a result of the market factors discussed in the paragraph above  we believe it will take longer than originally anticipated to reach an acceptable level of profitability in europe 
the major initiatives surrounding our restructuring program were completed in the third quarter of fiscal  and the savings realized from our restructuring initiatives have partially offset the pressure on our gross margins experienced during the year 
in addition  the dedicated resources which have been assigned across the region to optimize pricing  purchasing and sales management practices have begun to produce improvements 
during the second semester of fiscal  we have seen our european operations begin to stabilize with improving revenue growth and gross margins compared to the first semester of fiscal while we still have opportunities and expectations for additional improvement  we believe that our performance within several countries  especially during the second semester of fiscal  is a positive indicator of the company s ability to improve our operating performance in europe 
however  we continue to remain cautiously optimistic  as the competitive environment and changes in general economic conditions within the markets in which we conduct business may hinder our ability to continue to improve our operating margins from their current level 
effective february   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payments sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated our results of operations for the prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for fiscal includes compensation expense for stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   and for stock based compensation awards granted after january  sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation expense  reduced for estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
during fiscal  we recognized million of stock based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
see further discussion related to our adoption of sfas no 
r included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the information included within md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  vendor incentives  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  and contingencies 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results  and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio  the existence of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks 
also influencing our estimates are the following the large number of customers and their dispersion across wide geographic areas  the fact that no single customer accounts for more than of our net sales  the value and adequacy of collateral received from customers  if any and our historical loss experience 
if actual customer performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected by us  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
conversely  if actual customer performance were to improve to an extent not expected by us a reduction in allowances may be required which could have a favorable effect on our consolidated financial results 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of its cost or market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks such as technological obsolescence and the nature of vendor terms surrounding price protection and product returns  foreign currency fluctuations for foreign sourced product  and assumptions about future demand 
market conditions or changes in terms and conditions by our vendors that are less favorable than those projected by management may require additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  infrastructure funding  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors  however  some of these incentives are negotiated on an ad hoc basis to support specific programs mutually developed with the vendor 
unrestricted volume rebates and early payment discounts received from vendors are recorded as a reduction of inventory upon receipt of funds and as a reduction of cost of products sold as the related inventory is sold 
incentives received from vendors for specifically identified cooperative advertising programs and infrastructure funding are recorded as adjustments to selling  general and administrative expenses  and any reimbursement in excess of the related cost is recorded in the same manner as unrestricted volume rebates  as discussed above 

table of contents we also provide reserves for receivables on vendor programs for estimated losses resulting from vendors inability to pay or rejections of claims by vendors 
should amounts recorded as outstanding receivables from vendors be uncollectible  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and may also be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
we also examine the carrying value of our intangible assets with finite lives  which includes capitalized software and development costs  purchased intangibles  and other long lived assets as current events and circumstances warrant determining whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
factors that may cause a goodwill  intangible asset or other long lived asset impairment include negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
our valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to  estimating the net present value of the projected cash flows of our reporting units 
if actual results are substantially lower than our projections underlying these assumptions  or if market discount rates substantially increase  our future valuations could be adversely affected  potentially resulting in future impairment charges 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine we would be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies we accrue for contingent obligations  including estimated legal costs  when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include those related to tax  legal  and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports  the imposition of international governmental controls  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of international laws in particular related to items such as duty and taxation  and the impact of local economic conditions and practices  which are all subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process

table of contents net sales our consolidated net sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of when compared to fiscal on a regional basis  during fiscal  net sales in the americas increased by over fiscal and increased by in europe an increase of on a euro basis 
our sales performance in the americas is primarily due to stronger sales to direct marketers and retailers compared to the prior year somewhat offset by declining average selling prices of many of the products we sell 
the increase in european sales in fiscal is primarily the result of the improved it demand experienced in the second semester of fiscal and improved stability in our european operations partially offset by much lower demand in western europe during the first semester of fiscal particularly in the second quarter 
our consolidated net sales were approximately billion during fiscal  an increase of when compared to fiscal on a regional basis  during fiscal  net sales in the americas increased by over fiscal and decreased by in emea decrease of on a euro basis 
our performance in the americas was primarily due to reasons similar to those described above regarding our fiscal sales performance 
our performance in europe can be attributed to a combination of factors  including somewhat weaker demand conditions in certain countries  competitive pricing pressures resulting in declining average selling prices and  most notably  the diverted focus of our management team in the region 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin during fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to the more challenging pricing environment in europe  particularly in the second quarter of fiscal and the internal distractions of management related to the final phases of our comprehensive it systems upgrade and harmonization project and the implementation of the restructuring program in europe  as discussed above 
since the completion of these initiatives during the third quarter of fiscal  we have seen our european operations begin to stabilize and gross margins in the region improve sequentially during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal however  we continue to remain cautiously optimistic as the competitive environment and changes in general economic conditions within the markets in which we conduct business may hinder our ability to maintain and or continue to improve gross margin from its current level 
gross margin during fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the highly competitive pricing environment and operational challenges in our european operations  as discussed above  and to a much lesser extent  changes in customer and product mix in both europe and the americas 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of net sales in fiscal is the result of improvements in productivity  particularly in europe  where we are realizing the benefits associated with our restructuring efforts 
in absolute dollars  worldwide sg a increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in sg a in fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in credit costs in both the americas and europe due to higher than anticipated bankruptcies and other credit losses  increased labor costs in the americas  a stronger euro versus the us dollar in fiscal compared to fiscal  and an additional million of compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal these increases were offset in part by the productivity improvements and benefits realized in europe from the restructuring program  which we completed during the third fiscal quarter of sg a includes external consulting costs related to the european restructuring program of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was the result of continuing cost savings initiatives and improvements in productivity  particularly in europe  where we began to realize the benefits associated with our restructuring efforts 
also contributing to our decrease in sg a was a reduction in credit costs due to favorable credit experience and the positive resolution of contingencies associated with certain customer accounts 
in absolute dollars  worldwide sg a decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the benefits realized from the restructuring program and the decrease in credit costs  partially offset by million of external consulting costs incurred related to our european restructuring program  an increase in labor costs in the americas to support the additional sales and  to a lesser extent  a stronger us dollar versus the euro in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents goodwill impairment as discussed earlier in this md a  due to certain indicators of impairment within our european reporting unit  the company performed an impairment test for goodwill as of july  this testing included the determination of the european reporting unit s fair value using market multiples and discounted cash flows modeling 
the company s reduced earnings and cash flow forecast for our european region resulted in the company determining that a goodwill impairment charge was necessary 
as of july   the company recorded a million non cash charge for the goodwill impairment in europe 
restructuring charges as discussed earlier in this md a  in may  we announced a formal restructuring program to better align the european operating cost structure with the current business environment 
as of october   the initiatives related to the european restructuring program had been completed 
during fiscal  we incurred million related to the restructuring program  comprised of million for workforce reductions and million for facility costs 
in total  from inception through completion of the program  we incurred million related to the restructuring program  comprised of million for workforce reductions and million for facility costs 
interest expense  discount on sale of accounts receivable  interest income  foreign currency exchange gains losses interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to the repurchase of the million convertible subordinated debentures in the fourth quarter of fiscal using revolving credit facilities  which have higher short term borrowing rates 
in addition  average short term interest rates increased in comparison to the prior fiscal year  resulting in an increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense during fiscal was primarily due to additional working capital requirements resulting from higher sales volume and an increase in our average short term borrowing rate compared to the prior fiscal year 
discount on the sale of accounts receivable totaled million and million  respectively  in fiscal and the discount is associated with the accounts receivable purchase facility agreements executed in fiscal see further discussion below in this md a and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in the discount on sale of accounts receivable from fiscal to fiscal reflects the fact that the company began selling accounts receivable under the program in the second quarter of fiscal which resulted in an increase in the average amount of accounts receivables sold under the programs and an increase in the discount rates charged in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest income during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to higher interest rates earned on short term cash investments and higher average investment balances compared to the prior fiscal year 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest income during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to higher interest rates earned on short term cash investments compared to the prior fiscal year 
we realized a net foreign currency exchange gain of million in fiscal compared to a net foreign currency exchange loss of million during fiscal and a net foreign currency exchange gain of million in fiscal we recognize net foreign currency exchange gains and losses primarily due to the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar versus the euro  and to a lesser extent  versus other currencies 
it continues to be our goal to minimize foreign currency exchange gains and losses through an effective hedging program 
our hedging policy prohibits speculative foreign currency exchange transactions 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations was in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of the previously discussed goodwill impairment in europe of million  which is non deductible for tax purposes  and an increase in net operating losses in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized 
additionally  we recorded an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to certain jurisdictions in europe of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  related to net operating losses recorded in previous years 
on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of the decrease in the adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
while we believe our restructuring efforts will improve the operating performance within our european operations  we determined the respective increases in the valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in fiscal and to be appropriate due to cumulative 
table of contents losses realized within the respective fiscal years  after considering the effect of implementing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
to the extent we generate future consistent taxable income within those operations currently requiring the valuation allowance  we may reduce the valuation allowance on the related deferred tax assets  thereby reducing tax expense and increasing net income in the same period 
the underlying net operating loss carryforwards remain available to offset future taxable income in the specific jurisdictions requiring the valuation allowance  subject to applicable tax laws and regulations 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of the previously mentioned million increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of the increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of during these periods primarily for the reasons discussed above  net operating losses in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized and tax rate benefits of earnings from operations in certain lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us the overall effective tax rate is dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses and changes in tax laws or interpretations of these laws in our operating jurisdictions 
we regularly monitor the assumptions used in estimating our annual effective tax rate and adjust our estimates accordingly 
if actual results differ from our estimates  future income tax expense could be materially affected 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by lower earnings than anticipated in countries with lower statutory rates  changes in the relative mix of taxable income and taxable loss jurisdictions  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  our income tax returns are subject to continuous examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
at january   we believe we have appropriately accrued for probable income tax exposures 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of such accruals  our effective tax rate could be materially affected 
discontinued operations  net of tax the results of operations and the gain on sale of the training business have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations  net of tax  within the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
for fiscal  we realized income from discontinued operations  net of tax  of million  comprised of a million gain  net of tax  on the sale of the training business and million of income from operations of the training business prior to the sale in march we realized million and million of income from discontinued operations  net of tax  in fiscal and  respectively 
impact of inflation for the fiscal years ended january   and  we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on our consolidated operations or on our financial position 
quarterly data seasonality our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future as a result of currency fluctuations and seasonal variations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
narrow operating margins may magnify the impact of these factors on our operating results 
recent historical seasonal variations have included a reduction of demand in europe during our second and third fiscal quarters followed by an increase in european demand during our fiscal fourth quarter 
given that a significant portion of our revenues are derived from europe  the worldwide results closely follow the seasonality trends in europe 
additionally  the life cycles of major products  as well as the impact of future acquisitions and dispositions  may also materially impact our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources includes an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure  which includes both continuing and discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to affect the company s future liquidity 

table of contents the following table summarizes tech data s consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal years ended january   and years ended january  in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million cash provided by operations in fiscal the million cash used in operations in fiscal was due primarily to the timing of cash received from customers and the timing of payments to vendors 
in addition  our operating cash flows in fiscal were influenced by higher accounts receivable balances due to an acceleration of revenue growth in europe in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period of fiscal we have several key metrics we use to manage our working capital  including our cash conversion cycle also referred to as net cash days and owned inventory levels 
our net cash days are defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso plus days of supply on hand in inventory dos  less days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo 
owned inventory is calculated as the difference between our inventory and accounts payable balances divided into the inventory balance 
our net cash days remained relatively consistent at days at the end of fiscal compared to days at the end of fiscal our owned inventory level the percentage of inventory not financed by vendors was a negative at the end of fiscal  meaning our accounts payable balances exceeded our inventory balances by 
this compares to negative owned inventory of at the end of fiscal net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal due primarily to the timing of payments to vendors 
our net cash days improved by approximately to days at the end of fiscal compared to days at the end of fiscal  resulting from improved management of our worldwide cash conversion cycle 
our owned inventory level the percentage of inventory not financed by vendors was a negative at the end of fiscal this compared to negative owned inventory of at the end of fiscal the following table presents the components of tech data s cash conversion cycle  in days  as of january   and as of january  days of sales outstanding days of supply in inventory days of purchases outstanding cash conversion cycle days net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was primarily due to million of expenditures for the continuing expansion and upgrading of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers  offset by million proceeds received from the sale of the training business and million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
we expect to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal for equipment and machinery in our logistics centers  office facilities and it systems 
net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was primarily attributable to the continuing investment related to the expansion and upgrading of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers 
net cash provided by financing activities of million during fiscal is primarily the result of net proceeds of million received from the issuance of million of convertible debentures in december  million in proceeds received for the reissuance of treasury stock related to exercises of equity based awards and purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan espp  offset by million of net repayments on our revolving credit lines and long term debt and the use of million for the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal is primarily the result of the repayment of our million convertible subordinated debentures and million for the repurchase of  shares of our common stock  partially offset by net borrowings on our revolving credit lines of million and million in proceeds received for the issuance of common stock related to our stock option exercises and purchases made through our espp 

table of contents as of january   we maintained a million receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks 
we pay interest rate of at january  on the receivables securitization program at designated commercial paper rates plus an agreed upon margin 
additionally  we maintained a million multi currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires in march we pay interest rate of at january  under this facility at the applicable libor rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings 
in addition to these credit facilities  we maintained lines of credit and overdraft facilities totaling approximately million at january  average interest rate on the borrowing was at january  
the total capacity of the aforementioned credit facilities was approximately billion  of which million was outstanding at january  our credit agreements contain limitations on the amounts of annual dividends and repurchases of common stock 
additionally  the credit agreements require compliance with certain warranties and covenants 
the financial ratio covenants contained within the credit agreements include a debt to capitalization ratio  an interest to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  deprecation and amortization ratio  and a tangible net worth requirement 
at january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
the ability to draw funds under these credit facilities is dependent upon sufficient collateral in the case of the receivables securitization program and meeting the aforementioned financial covenants  which may limit our ability to draw the full amount of these facilities 
as of january   the maximum amount that could be borrowed under these facilities  in consideration of the availability of collateral and the financial covenants  was approximately million 
on march   we amended the million multi currency revolving credit facility  the receivables securitization program and the synthetic lease facility we have with a group of financial institutions the synthetic lease  further discussed below 
the primary purpose of these amendments was to obtain more favorable interest rates  lease rates and facility fees 
in addition  the maturity date of the multi currency revolving credit facility was extended to march  at january   we had issued standby letters of credit of million 
these letters of credit typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
the issuance of these letters of credit reduces our available capacity under the above mentioned facilities by the same amount 
in december  we issued million of convertible senior debentures due the debentures bear interest at per year 
we will pay interest on the debentures on june and december of each year  beginning on june  in addition  beginning with the period commencing on december  and ending on june  and for each six month period thereafter  we will pay contingent interest on the interest payment date for the applicable interest period  if the market price of the debentures exceeds specified levels 
the convertible senior debentures are convertible into our common stock and cash anytime after june   or i if the market price of the common stock  as defined  exceeds of the conversion price per share of common stock  or ii if the company calls the debentures for redemption  or iii upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions  as defined 
holders have the right to convert the debentures into shares per  principal amount of debentures  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
upon conversion  we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted and our total conversion obligation and shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder  if any  of our conversion obligation 
holders have the option to require us to repurchase the debentures in cash on any of the fifth  tenth or fifteenth anniversary dates from the issue date at of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the repurchase date 
the debentures are redeemable in whole or in part for cash at our option at any time on or after december  additionally  the debentures are senior  unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the debentures are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the proceeds from the offering were used to payoff short term debt and for other general corporate purposes 
in december  we completed an exchange offer whereby approximately of our then outstanding million convertible subordinated debentures the old notes were exchanged for new debentures the new notes 
the new notes had substantially identical terms to the previously outstanding old notes 
in accordance with the debenture agreement  on december   the debenture holders of the new notes exercised their option to require the company to repurchase the debentures 
we repurchased the new notes using cash and existing credit lines 
in addition  prior to january   we also repurchased the old notes using cash and existing credit lines 
in may  we withdrew our million universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission as we made the decision not to issue debt or equity securities through this registration statement 

table of contents in fiscal  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our common stock 
share repurchases under the program were made on the open market through block trades or otherwise 
the number of shares purchased and the timing of the purchases was based on working capital requirements  general business conditions and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
shares we repurchase are held in treasury for general corporate purposes  including issuances under employee equity incentive plans 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares comprised of  shares purchased in conjunction with our share repurchase program and  shares purchased outside of the stock repurchase program  at an average of per share  for a total cost  including expenses  of million 
as of october   the share repurchase program authorized in fiscal was completed 
our debt to capital ratio was at january  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with funds available under our credit arrangements  will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and future working capital and cash requirements for at least the next months 
changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital  or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs 
the company will continue to need additional financing  including debt financing 
the inability to obtain such sources of capital could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s credit facilities contain various financial and other covenants that may limit the company s ability to borrow or limit the company s flexibility in responding to business conditions 
contractual obligations as of january   future payments of long term debt and amounts due under future minimum lease payments  including minimum commitments under it outsourcing agreements  are as follows in thousands operating leases capital leases long term debt total fiscal year thereafter total payments less amounts representing interest total principal payments fair value renewal and purchase options and escalation clauses exist for a substantial portion of the operating leases included above 
purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on tech data and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current demand expectations and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant non cancelable agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease facility we have a synthetic lease facility with a group of financial institutions under which we lease certain logistics centers and office facilities from a third party lessor 
the synthetic lease expires in fiscal  at which time we have the following options renew the lease for an additional five years  purchase the properties at an amount equal to their cost  or remarket the properties 
if we elect to remarket the properties  we have guaranteed the lessor a percentage of the cost of each of the properties  in an aggregate amount of approximately million the residual value 
at any time during the lease term  we may  at our option purchase up to four of the seven properties  at an amount equal to each property s cost 
we pay interest on the synthetic lease at libor plus an agreed upon margin 
the synthetic lease contains covenants that must be complied with  similar to the covenants described in certain of the credit facilities discussed above and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amount funded under the 
table of contents synthetic lease approximately million at january  is treated as debt under the definition of the covenants required under both the synthetic lease and the credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
in january  we sold approximately acres of excess land located in miami  florida 
the sale was executed pursuant to the excess sale provisions of the synthetic lease agreement and resulted in a gain of million recorded during the quarter ended january  this gain is included within sg a our consolidated statement of operations 
the sum of future minimum lease payments under the synthetic lease at january  was approximately million 
properties leased under the synthetic lease facility total million square feet of space  with land totaling approximately acres located in clearwater and miami  florida  fort worth  texas  fontana  california  suwanee  georgia  swedesboro  new jersey  and south bend  indiana 
the synthetic lease has been accounted for as an operating lease 
fasb interpretation fin no 
requires us to evaluate whether an entity with which we are involved meets the criteria of a variable interest entity vie and  if so  whether we are required to consolidate that entity 
we have determined that the third party lessor of this synthetic lease facility does not meet the criteria of a vie and  therefore  is not subject to the consolidation provisions of fin no 
trade receivables purchase facility agreements we have revolving trade receivables purchase facility agreements the receivables facilities with third party financial institutions to sell accounts receivable on a non recourse basis 
we use the receivables facilities as a source of working capital funding 
the receivables facilities limit the amount of purchased accounts receivable the financial institutions may hold to million at january   based on currency exchange rates at that date 
under the receivables facilities  we may sell certain accounts receivable the receivables in exchange for cash less a discount based on libor plus a margin 
such transactions have been accounted for as a true sale  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the receivables facilities  which have various expiration dates  require that we continue to service  administer and collect the sold accounts receivable 
during fiscal and  we received gross proceeds of billion and million  respectively  from the sale of the receivables and recognized related discounts totaling million and million  respectively 
the proceeds  net of the discount incurred  are reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in operating activities within cash received from customers and the change in accounts receivable 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  the company did not utilize the receivables facilities as a source of funding 
guarantees as is customary in the it industry  to encourage certain customers to purchase product from us  we have arrangements with certain finance companies that provide inventory financing facilities for our customers 
in conjunction with certain of these arrangements  we have agreements with the finance companies that would require us to repurchase certain inventory  which might be repossessed from the customers by the finance companies 
due to various reasons  including among other items  the lack of information regarding the amount of saleable inventory purchased from us still on hand with the customer at any point in time  our repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated 
repurchases of inventory by us under these arrangements have been insignificant to date 
we also provide additional financial guarantees to finance companies on behalf of certain customers 
the majority of these guarantees are for an indefinite period of time  where we would be required to perform if the customer is in default with the finance company 
the company reviews the underlying credit for these guarantees on at least an annual basis 
as of january  and  the aggregate amount of guarantees under these arrangements totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which approximately million and million  respectively  was outstanding 
we believe that  based on historical experience  the likelihood of a material loss pursuant to both of the above guarantees is remote 
additionally  in connection with the sale of the training business discussed in note discontinued operations  we continue to negotiate the assignment of several of the related facility lease obligations with the lessors of such properties 
to the extent the lessors are unwilling to agree to a direct lease arrangement with the purchaser  we will remain liable in the event of default by the purchaser of the training business 
the majority of these lease obligations expire at various dates over the next three years and would require that we make all required payments under the lease agreements in the event of default by the purchaser 
the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted that we could be required to make under the guarantees is approximately million as of january  we believe that the likelihood of a material loss pursuant to these guarantees is remote 

table of contents we also provide residual value guarantees related to our synthetic lease which have been recorded at the estimated fair value of the residual value guarantees 
asset management we manage our inventories by maintaining sufficient quantities to achieve high order fill rates while attempting to stock only those products in high demand with a rapid turnover rate 
inventory balances fluctuate as we add new product lines and when appropriate  we make large purchases  including cash purchases from manufacturers and publishers when the terms of such purchases are considered advantageous 
our contracts with most of our vendors provide price protection and stock rotation privileges to reduce the risk of loss due to manufacturer price reductions and slow moving or obsolete inventory 
in the event of a vendor price reduction  we generally receive a credit for the impact on products in inventory and we have the right to rotate a certain percentage of purchases  subject to certain limitations 
historically  price protection and stock rotation privileges as well as our inventory management procedures have helped to reduce the risk of loss of inventory value 
we attempt to control losses on credit sales by closely monitoring customers creditworthiness through our it systems  which contain detailed information on each customer s payment history and other relevant information 
we have obtained credit insurance that insures a percentage of the credit extended by us to certain customers against possible loss 
customers who qualify for credit terms are typically granted net day payment terms in the americas 
while credit terms in europe vary by country  the vast majority of customers are granted credit terms ranging from days 
we also sell products on a prepay  credit card and cash on delivery basis 
in addition  certain of the company s vendors subsidize floorplan financing arrangements for the benefit of our customers

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk as a large global organization  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial results in the future 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
it is our policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed 
additionally  we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our primary exposure relates to transactions in europe  where the currency collected from customers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect our earnings and cash flows from the adverse impact of exchange rate changes 
foreign exchange risk is managed by using foreign currency forward  option and swap contracts to hedge both intercompany and third party a loans  b accounts receivable and c accounts payable 
we have elected not to designate our foreign currency contracts as hedging instruments  and they are therefore marked to market with changes in their value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations each period 
during fiscal and  the underlying exposures are denominated primarily in the following currencies us dollar  british pound  canadian dollar  czech koruna  danish krone  euro  norwegian krone  polish zloty  swedish krona and swiss franc

interest rate risk is also present in the forward foreign currency contracts hedging intercompany and third party loans 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objective  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of january  and  approximately and  respectively  of the outstanding debt had fixed interest rates
