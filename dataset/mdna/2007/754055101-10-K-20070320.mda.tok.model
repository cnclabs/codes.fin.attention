overview raser technologies  inc  a utah corporation raser  the company  we or our is a technology licensing and development company 
we operate in two business segments  transportation and industrial technology  and power systems 
the transportation and industrial technology segment focuses on improving the efficiency and power density of electric motors  generators and their associated power electronic drives and controls 
this technology is known as symetron tm technology 
the power systems segment is seeking to develop new geothermal electric power generating plants and bottom cycling operations that generate electric power from the waste heat of existing power plants and industrial facilities  incorporating licensed heat transfer technology and our symetron tm technology 
raser was formed on july  and organized under the laws of the state of utah as a successor to raser technologies  llc  a utah limited liability company formed on october  on october   the company became a publicly traded company through a reverse merger with wasatch web advisors  inc we have developed several innovations in electric motors and their associated electronic drives and controllers that allow for increased torque  power and efficiency 
the electromagnetic machine and power electronic drive technology is trademarked under the name symetron tm 
the technologies can be applied to industrial ac induction motors  and drives  permanent magnet motors  automotive alternators and integrated starter alternators isa s  for use in industrial and transportation applications  hybrid electric and electric vehicle propulsion systems  and other applications where the efficiency of electricity to motion or motion to electricity power conversions can be improved 
we believe that symetron tm technologies can also be applied to electric power generation applications 
in  we acquired a non exclusive license for certain patents  patents pending  and technical information relating to certain heat transfer technologies  including geothermal  waste heat recovery and bottom cycling applications 
we believe that a combination of these and other technologies  our management s significant experience in developing power projects  the geothermal properties and resources we have secured and the various incentives the us government has established for alternative energy applications  provide us with an attractive opportunity for establishing a significant geothermal power and waste heat recovery business 
consistent with our limited operating history  we have generated very limited revenues from operations and have not yet commercially licensed our transportation and industrial technologies 
we are in an early stage of development and there is limited historical information upon which an evaluation can be made regarding our business and prospects 
we also have limited insight into how market and technology trends may affect our future business 
the revenue and income potential of both our operating segments is unproven and the markets in which 
table of contents we expect to compete are very competitive and rapidly evolving 
our business and prospects should be considered in light of the risks  expenses  cash requirements  challenges and uncertainties that exist in an early stage company seeking to develop new technologies and products in competitive and rapidly evolving markets 
trends and uncertainties transportation market we continue marketing our symetron tm enhanced alternator design to component manufacturers 
we are seeking to enter licensing discussions with one or more customers during we have limited experience with licensing our technologies  however  and our ability to increase licensing revenues is uncertain 
our p isa is designed for a commercial automobile  and we believe it can be scaled up to suit truck and construction equipment sized applications 
we have begun work on a scaled up p isa and hybrid propulsion motor  designed for larger vehicles 
we have continued work on a larger isa under our cooperative research and development agreement crada with the army on the first task of a multi year development proposal to create an ac induction based isa for a military humvee hybrid vehicle 
together with arinc incorporated  arinc  we have submitted a proposal to the united states army army for the follow on tasks under this development proposal 
the army has selected us for a subcontract award and we have successfully completed the first payment milestone 
we expect to continue to successfully complete all milestones within the subcontracted time  however  unforeseen events may result in delays in completing the subcontract 
we signed an agreement to provide design and engineering services to a wholly owned subsidiary of a publicly traded  singapore based engineering company 
we expect to provide technical  engineering and design support for the development and manufacture of a switched reluctance sr motor and drive 
the agreement provides for royalty payments on a sliding scale based on sales of up to  units as sr motors utilizing our designs are sold 
we do not expect material revenue from this contract and  due to product development and deployment schedules  no revenue may be recognized for a year or more 
we have entered into an agreement with a subcontractor to provide services to the singapore company for a development fee  and if the project is successful  we expect to receive royalty payments 
however  it is uncertain whether we will receive any royalty payments from this contract 
industrial market we completed testing of our flexmod tm flexible  modular controller design with advanced energy under their contract with the department of energy during the quarter ended september  results obtained from dynamometer testing demonstrated efficiency gains of up to could be obtained by applying symetron tm concepts to variable speed motors over a wide range of load conditions for motors varying from hp to hp 
although the test results are encouraging  the tests were conducted in a laboratory environment and we can give no assurance that similar efficiency gains will be achieved in commercial applications 
an independent final report quantifying the benefit potential of the technology was issued by advanced energy  washington state university and the department of energy 
based upon the results indicated in the report  we will begin the development process to create appropriate electronic motor control software for commercialization of the documented efficiency improvement phenomenon in 
table of contents power generation market we are positioning ourselves to be one of the primary developers of geothermal and industrial waste heat power in the us we intend to leverage our technology platform and developer skills to establish tax credit sharing payment streams from incentives available to renewable energy providers 
we believe we are well positioned for entry into this market 
initially  we are considering three potential applications for our recently acquired heat transfer technology geothermal power geothermal power plants use underground steam or hot water from wells drilled deep into the earth 
the steam or hot water is piped up from the well to drive a conventional steam turbine directly or through the use of a working fluid  which powers an electric generator 
typically  the extracted hot fluid is returned to the ground to recharge the reservoir 
power plant bottom cycling most power plants utilizing conventional technologies generate excess heat that is not used to generate electricity 
for example  approximately of the heat value of coal is typically transformed into electricity 
the rest of the heat is lost in the process  but has the potential to be partially recovered through bottom cycling to generate additional electricity 
the ability to bottom cycle power plants affords the opportunity to generate additional electricity and take advantage of existing power generation and transmission infrastructure at a low incremental cost 
industrial waste heat bottom cycling many industries generate waste heat that can be harvested to produce electricity through application of this heat transfer technology 
this power is then used to help operate that industrial facility  reducing its power costs 
in the united states  we expect to benefit from the increasing demand for renewable energy as a result of favorable legislation adopted by several states 
renewable portfolio standards rps adopted by these states require that an increasing percentage of electricity supplied by utilities be derived from renewable energy sources 
a change in legislation could reverse the current demand for renewable energy production 
the viability of the geothermal resources depends upon such factors as the heat content in the geothermal reservoir  useful life of the reservoir  and operation factors relating to the extraction of geothermal fluids 
such factors  together with the possibility that we may fail to secure commercially viable geothermal resources in the future  represent significant uncertainties in connection with our operations 
the federal government encourages production of electricity from geothermal resources through certain tax subsidies 
we are permitted to claim in our consolidated federal tax returns either an investment tax credit for approximately of the cost of each new geothermal power plant or production tax credits of cents plus an inflation factor a kilowatt hour on the first ten years of electricity output 
currently  production tax credits can only be claimed on new plants put into service between october  and december  we believe that congress will continue to extend the production tax credits into the future 
however  there can be no assurances that this will occur 
elimination of the production tax credit would significantly impair our ability to monetize and finance the construction of geothermal power plants 
we are also permitted to deduct most of the cost of the power plant as depreciation over five years on an accelerated basis 
the fact that the deductions are accelerated means that more of the cost is deducted in the first few years than during the remainder of the depreciation period 
we have the ability to transfer the value of these tax incentives when we are not in a position to use them directly 
for instance  depreciation benefits can be transferred through lease financing  and production tax credits may be transferred by bringing in another company who can use them as a partner in the project 

table of contents sources of revenue to date  our primary source of revenue has been from research and development subcontracts  administered through contractors with certain government agencies  in which we perform engineering design  development and testing activities to demonstrate that our technologies in specific applications are viable 
in  we expect to continue generating modest revenues from research and development contracts and subcontracts awarded by both government agencies and private companies  primarily in the united states  as we continue developing our technologies for commercial applications 
we anticipate additional revenues will be generated from transportation and industrial technology licenses and related royalty agreements  although we have not yet commercially licensed our technologies 
we are offering our technology license  primarily in the united states  through our direct sales force as well as through selected sales agents familiar with rotating electromagnetic technology and specific industries 
once our technologies have become commercialized  we intend to market our technology licenses to companies in north america  asia and europe 
licenses of our rotating electromagnetic technology to potential customers will typically result from the entry of the potential customer into our test demonstration program 
our test demonstration program involves four phases described as follows phase i paper test an initial indication of engineered value to the customer which is provided through our computer modeling capabilities  phase ii install test a customer specific demonstration of the symetron tm advanced motor technology into a motor of the customer s choosing  phase iii system test an application specific installation of our technology into the customer s product  and phase iv license an agreement whereby the customer will acquire specified rights to manufacture or use the symetron tm advanced motor technology 
our intent is to continue developing relationships with current and potential customers and accelerate their progress through the test demonstration program during as a result  we do not have an established revenue stream and our revenues to date have not been significant 
we obtained the right to begin development and construction of geothermal power plants on three ranches in nevada  consisting of approximately  acres  and to pursue such projects on million additional acres of land in which the three ranches may have geothermal rights 
we believe that as we develop these and other properties  revenue will be generated through various means 
primarily  we believe that the license of our geothermal heat transfer technology will typically involve an alliance partner with specific power generation interests  or a financial partner with specific interests in the favorable tax attributes available to renewable energy producers 
we expect that after receiving the necessary permits and upon successfully placing each geothermal power plant in operation  we will generate additional revenue streams derived from specified royalty agreements 
although we have had discussions with prospective power generation partners  none of these discussions has yet resulted in a license or investment 
development of properties to implement the technology will likely take a year or more and specific projects or portions of a project may be sold prior to commissioning 
we may also elect to utilize our heat transfer technology license through either purchasing and operating an existing geothermal power plant or drilling  constructing and operating our own geothermal power plant 
in these cases  revenue will be generated primarily from the sale of electricity from the power plants to electric utilities pursuant to long term power purchase agreements 
such revenue is subject to seasonal variations based upon electricity usage of the end users 
to date  the properties are still in the exploratory phase and have had limited evaluation for viability  generating capacity  or potential reserves 

table of contents significant expenses transportation and industrial since inception  we have incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and to build brand recognition for the transportation and industrial markets 
however  we have not yet commercially licensed our technologies 
the principal expenses directly attributable to research and development are engineering salaries  equity based compensation  certain consulting contracts  operating costs of our testing facility  and purchases of motors and parts for testing 
direct costs attributable to a contract or subcontract are included in costs of sales 
selling and administrative costs primarily consist of administrative salaries  equity based compensation to employees and non employees  certain administrative consultants  legal and audit fees  and operating costs of our corporate headquarters 
power systems we expect the principal expenses related to developing geothermal power plants  including costs for property acquisition  exploration  drilling  construction and operation will either be financed by an alliance partner or incurred by raser 
expenses include salaries  equity based compensation  costs relating to third party services  lease rentals and royalty payments  depletion and amortization for successfully implemented power plants  and other equipment and construction costs as deemed necessary to advance projects to completion 
lease acquisition costs  lease bonuses  certain legal fees  drilling costs  and construction costs are capitalized until the project is abandoned and written off 
geothermal heat transfer license royalties and other geothermal lease payments will be included in the costs of sales when the plant is placed into service 
losses since inception we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had incurred an accumulated deficit and deficit accumulated after re entry into the development stage of approximately million on cumulative revenues of approximately  our net losses before preferred stock dividends for the year ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during the twelve months ended december  the monthly cash expenditure rate for operations increased to million per month from approximately million per month in the twelve months ended december  the higher spending rate reflects both preparation for the proposed amp resources acquisition and increased employment levels 
we may make more investments and pursue alliances that could increase our rate of cash outlay in the future 
as a company heavily involved in research and development and without an established revenue stream  we have made use of equity based compensation in several instances to conserve cash 
the year ended december  included non cash equity based compensation expenses to employees and service contractors of approximately million 
of the equity based employee compensation  approximately million is related to stock grants to employees  approximately million for stock grants to service providers  and approximately million is associated with the issuance of stock options to our employees 
the year ending december  included non cash equity based compensation expenses to employees of approximately million and non cash equity based compensation of approximately million for contracted services 
we settled two employment arrangements with two former employees by agreeing to issue  and  shares of common stock from april through december of and from january through september  respectively 
approximately million of non cash equity expense was recognized in the twelve months ended december  related to these settlements 

table of contents our limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult 
we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon to predict future performance 
our ability to become profitable must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly companies in rapidly evolving markets 
dividends related to convertible preferred stock as a result of the warrants granted in connection with our sale of series c convertible preferred stock  the redemption feature associated with the series c convertible preferred stock and the beneficial conversion feature inherent in the conversion rights and preferences of series c convertible preferred stock  the company recognized a deemed dividend of  in the second quarter of this deemed dividend was calculated based on the conversion price compared to the market price  the value of the warrants and the value of the redemption feature on the date of issuance of the preferred shares 
as a result of the warrants granted in connection with our sale of series b convertible preferred stock and the beneficial conversion feature inherent in the conversion rights and preferences of series b convertible preferred stock  the company recognized a deemed dividend of  in this deemed dividend was calculated based on the conversion price compared to the market price on the dates of issuance of the preferred shares 
we paid cash dividends of  and  in and respectively to the series b convertible preferred shareholders 
all remaining outstanding shares of our series b convertible preferred stock were converted into shares of common stock during the first quarter of  thereby concluding our dividend obligation related to series b preferred stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of our audited consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item of this annual report 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
the application of these policies requires management to use significant judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain when reporting financial results 
such estimates are based upon management s historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  management observance of trends in the transportation  industrial and power production industries  information provided by our customers and information available to management from other outside sources  as appropriate 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with our audit committee 
we describe specific risks related to these critical accounting policies below 
regarding all of these policies  we caution that future results rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts valuation allowance against deferred income taxes impairment of long lived assets tangible and intangible stock based compensation  and 
table of contents business combinations revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with applicable accounting standards and guidance  including staff accounting bulletin or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  as amended 
although we have earned limited revenues since inception  we expect to earn revenue in the future through various sources 
the primary sources of anticipated revenue are royalty and other fees from geothermal power generation or from transportation and industrial applications  fees for the license of technology  operating revenue from geothermal power plant operations  contracted and subcontracted engineering services for governmental agencies  and fees for engineering services recognition of royalty revenue from geothermal power generation will occur as soon as the production quantity on which the payment is to be based is known 
we anticipate that geothermal royalty revenue will be generally set at a prescribed dollar amount per kilowatt hour on a percentage of electric revenue and tax credits earned by the licensee 
recurring license fees or royalty payments will be recognized in the period when earned  which coincides with the sale of electricity by our licensees  provided standard revenue recognition criteria such as amounts being fixed or determinable are met 
recognition of license fee revenue will occur when a signed agreement exists with the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  we have delivered the license to the customer  collection of the license fee is reasonably assured  and we have no ongoing or future service obligation 
if the license agreement requires us to provide services in connection with the license over a period of time  the license fee revenue will be recognized ratably over the contractual period 
recognition of revenue related to contracted and subcontracted engineering services for governmental agencies with specific performance criteria occurs when the customer agrees that the specific performance criteria have been met 
costs incurred to achieve the performance criteria are deferred and recognized concurrent with the recognition of revenue unless they are determined to be unrecoverable 
for contracts in which the fee is estimated to equal of the cost to complete the contract  we recognize revenue as the cost is incurred to complete the project using zero as our estimate of profit under the percentage of completion method 
recognition of revenue related to engineering services will depend on whether the revenue is contingent on deliverables required by the agreement 
if the fee is non refundable  we have no specific milestones to meet  and there are no required performance criteria  we recognize the revenue as the cost is incurred to complete the project on the percentage of completion basis 
for agreements with specific milestones that must be met before payment becomes due  we recognize the revenue at the completion of each milestone on the percentage of completion basis 
costs incurred to achieve the milestones are deferred until the recognition of the related revenue unless such costs are determined not to be recoverable 
in the period when estimated costs exceed projected revenues  we recognize a loss on the contract 
recognition of royalty revenue will occur when the production quantity on which the payment is to be based is incurred 
allowance for uncollectible accounts 
contractual rights to future payments associated with trade accounts receivable and notes receivable are evaluated to determine the likelihood of collecting amounts due 
the evaluation includes a review of available financial information related to the debtors ability to pay  historical payment pattern  security positions  government regulations  most recent communications and an assessment of current economic conditions in determining the net realizable value of our receivables 
we also review our allowance for uncollectible accounts in aggregate for adequacy following this assessment 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets tangible and intangible 
equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging from three to seven years 
leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated over the remaining life of the lease 
costs of internally developing  maintaining or restoring patents and trademarks that are specifically identifiable and have determinate lives are capitalized 
the costs of patents are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life or years from the date of the first filing 
the costs of trademarks are not amortized because their useful lives are indefinite 
costs incurred to acquire our global heat transfer technology license have been capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the related patents underlying and accompanying the license  or years 
costs incurred to acquire unproved geothermal properties are capitalized and not amortized until reserves are discovered 
once reserves are discovered  the property is classified as a proved property and capitalized costs are amortized 
exploration costs including costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties  such as delay rentals  certain taxes on the properties  legal costs for title defense  and the maintenance of land and lease records are expensed when incurred 
assuming they cannot be used as reinjection in wells  unsuccessful exploration or dry hole wells on unproved properties are expensed in the period in which the wells are determined to be dry 
dry hole wells on proved property are capitalized and amortized 
we are currently assessing which generally accepted accounting principle method to use for depletion 
we assess recoverability of our patents by determining whether the amortization of the balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate which reflects our average cost of funds 
we have experienced a challenge to our intellectual trademark by razor usa llc 
we believe that the opposition filed before the trademark trial and appeals board is without merit 
we will vigorously defend the trademark and will capitalize the amount spent in defense of the trademark rights as long as a successful outcome is reasonably anticipated 
a negative outcome would result in impairment of the trademark which would be written off and expensed accordingly 
we periodically review equipment  intangible assets and unproved geothermal properties for impairment 
abandoned or permanently impaired assets are written off and expensed in the period when the impairment occurs 
valuation allowance against deferred income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded when there is a difference between the financial reporting and tax treatment of financial transactions 
we recorded a valuation allowance to offset the entire net deferred tax asset as of december   and  respectively 
the valuation allowance was recorded due to the losses incurred and the uncertainties regarding the future taxable income and recoverability of such deferred tax assets 
we continually evaluate the estimated recoverability of deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
instead  companies are required to account for such equity transactions using an approach in 
table of contents which the fair value of an award is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
compensation expense is adjusted for equity awards that do not vest because service or performance conditions are not satisfied 
however  compensation expense already recognized is not adjusted if market conditions are not met  such as stock options which expire out of the money  or options which expire unexercised 
the new standard was adopted using the modified prospective method and beginning with the first quarter of  the company reflects compensation expense in accordance with sfas r s transition provision 
under the modified prospective method  the effect of the standard is recognized in the period of adoption and in future periods 
prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard

r and emerging issues task force  eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods  or services which require expense recognition based on the fair value of the options and warrants granted 
we calculate the fair value of options and warrants granted by using the black scholes option pricing model as of either the grant date or performance completion date  as applicable 
we have issued shares of common stock to certain employees as payment for services and have entered into agreements to issue stock over a specified vesting period 
we have also issued shares of common stock to non employees as payment for services and have entered into agreements to issue stock either when a performance condition has been completed or based upon a specified vesting period 
stock issued for services  to both employees and non employees  is valued based on the fair value on either the grant date or the performance completion date as required by sfas no 
r and eitf and is recognized over the requisite service period 
business combinations 
the proposed acquisition of amp resources did not close  and consequently all of the expenses associated with the negotiation  document preparation  due diligence and other acquisition related activities were expensed 
upon concluding our settlement agreement with amp resources on september   we received a license to use certain heat transfer technologies 
while there were no direct payments to obtain this license  approximately million of external expenses associated with reaching the settlement during the third quarter of were capitalized as the intangible cost of obtaining the license 
successful efforts method of accounting for geothermal energy activities 
consistent with the securities and exchange commission sec financial accounting and reporting standards prescribed in regulation s x for companies engaged in the oil and gas producing activities  industry standards financial and reporting standards for companies engaged in geothermal power generation prescribe two method of accountings the successful efforts method and the full cost method
