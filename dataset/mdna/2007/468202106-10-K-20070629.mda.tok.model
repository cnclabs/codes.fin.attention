other financial product revenues beginning in january  we no longer earn other financial product revenues related to rals provided to our customers

hsbc in other financial product revenues represented revenues we earned equal to a portion ranging from to of the difference between net finance fees paid by customers to hsbc and loan amounts that hsbc was unable to collect

table of contents fiscal year ended april  as compared to the fiscal year ended april  total revenues total revenues increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in the average revenues per tax return prepared by our network  higher financial product fees under our agreements with sbb t and hsbc and cumulative growth and higher pricing per product in our gold guarantee program 
average revenues per tax return prepared increased primarily as a result of stronger pricing 
the increase in financial product fees is largely related to the attainment of certain contractual growth thresholds and higher fixed fees under our agreements 
customer retention was approximately just over in fiscal same store tax return volume decreased approximately 
our network of franchised and company owned offices prepared million tax returns in fiscal  a decline of as compared to fiscal contributing to the overall decline were the increased competitive environment  due in part to various pre season loan products in the marketplace  and the shift in taxpayer filings from early season to late season  compounded by the negative publicity in early april surrounding the announcement by the department of justice of the doj lawsuits 
preceding  our business consistently experienced significant growth in the early season  with approximately three fourths of the number of tax returns being prepared in our offices during that time 
over the past few years  however  the overall tax filing market has experienced a shift in which more taxpayers are filing later in the tax season  moving from the early season to the late season 
through the end of february  there were just under two million fewer tax returns filed with the irs than during the same period in we believe the stronger economy over the past few years with declining unemployment and continued wage growth has reduced the desire for certain taxpayers to file in the early season and receive their income tax refund as soon as possible 
in fiscal  our early season business was impacted by this shift 
we believe the shift in taxpayer filings from early season to late season may be cyclical and could reverse following a slower economy 
total irs tax filings have continued to grow over the years  but the growth has occurred in the late season 
our business has also historically experienced higher growth in the late season as compared to the early season with the number of tax returns prepared by our network historically growing at a rate significantly exceeding that of the overall tax filing market s rate 
following the slow start in january discussed above  many of our traditional early season customers began to come back to our network in february as our business returned to strong growth in the number of tax returns prepared 
however  our overall late season business was somewhat impacted by the negative publicity in early april surrounding the announcement by the department of justice of the doj lawsuits  which contributed to the overall decline in the number of tax returns prepared by our network in fiscal an important element of our location strategy is that the maturation of our offices from which the average number of tax returns prepared per office increases as offices age 
our retail partner locations typically prepare fewer tax returns as they tend to be smaller in size than typical storefront locations 
due to the factors already discussed above  the average number of tax returns prepared per office presented in the table below decreased in most age categories as compared to fiscal the following table includes  for fiscal  the average number of tax returns prepared by offices in our network  including the percentage of retail partner locations as a percentage of total offices by age category  based upon the number of years in our network
