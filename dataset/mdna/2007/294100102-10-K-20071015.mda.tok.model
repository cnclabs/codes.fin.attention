item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
see forward looking and cautionary statements 
because of the foregoing factors  you should not rely on past financial results as an indication of future performance 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results to date are not necessarily meaningful and expect that our results of operations might fluctuate from period to period in the future 
the company is a life sciences and biotechnology company focused on harnessing genetic processes to develop research tools and therapeutics and the provision of diagnostic services to the medical community 
since its founding in  enzo s strategic focus has been on the development  for commercial purposes  of enabling technologies in the life sciences field 
enzo s pioneering work in genomic analysis coupled with its extensive patent estate and enabling platforms have strategically positioned enzo to play a crucially important role in the rapidly growing life sciences and molecular medicine marketplaces we are comprised of three operating companies that have evolved out of our core competence the use of nucleic acids as informational molecules and the use of compounds for immune modulation 
these wholly owned operating companies conduct their operations through three reportable segments 
below are brief descriptions of each of the three operating segments see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements enzo life sciences is a company that manufactures  develops and markets biomedical research products and tools to research and pharmaceutical customers around the world and has amassed a large patent and technology portfolio 
the company s sources of revenue have been from the direct sales of products consisting of labeling and detection reagents for the genomics and sequencing markets  as well as through non exclusive distribution agreements with other companies  and royalty and licensing income 
the pioneering platforms developed by enzo life sciences enable the development of a wide range of products in the research products marketplace 
the division is internationally recognized and acknowledged for its manufacturing  in licensing  and commercialization of over  innovative high quality research reagents in key research areas 
the division is an established source for a comprehensive panel of products to scientific experts in the fields of gene expression  non radioactive labeling and detection  adipokines and obesity  apoptosis  cell cycle  cytoskeletal research  dna damage and repair  immunology and cancer research  inflammation  neurobiology  nitric oxide oxidative stress  and signal transduction 
enzo therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company that has developed multiple novel approaches in the areas of gastrointestinal  infectious  ophthalmic and metabolic diseases  many of which are derived from the pioneering work of enzo life sciences 
the company has focused its efforts on developing treatment regimens for diseases and conditions in which current treatment options are ineffective  costly  and or cause unwanted side effects 
this focus has generated a clinical and preclinical pipeline  as well as more than patents and patent applications 
enzo clinical labs is a regional clinical laboratory to the greater new york and new jersey medical community 
the company believes having this capability allows us to capitalize firsthand on our extensive advanced molecular and cytogenetic capabilities and the broader trends in predictive diagnostics 
we offer a menu of routine and esoteric clinical laboratory tests or procedures used in general patient care by physicians to establish or support a diagnosis  monitor treatment or medication  or search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition 
we operate a full service clinical laboratory in farmingdale  new york  a network of patient service centers  a stand alone stat or rapid response laboratory in new york city  and a full service phlebotomy department 
the company s sources of revenue have been from the direct sales of products consisting of labeling and detection reagents for the genomics and sequencing markets  as well as through non exclusive distribution agreements with other companies  and royalty and license fee income 
another source of revenue has been from the clinical laboratory service market 
payments for clinical laboratory testing services are made by the medicare program  healthcare insurers and patients 
fees billed to patients  medicare  and third party payers are billed on the laboratory s standard gross fee schedule  subject to any limitations on fees negotiated with the third party payers or with the ordering physicians on behalf of their patients 
the following table summarizes the sources of revenues for the fiscal years ended july   and  in s and percentages fiscal year ended july  product revenues royalty and license fees clinical laboratory services total the company incurs additional costs as a result of our participation in the medicare programs  as billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to considerable and complex federal regulations 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations  as well as internal compliance policies and procedures  adds further complexity and costs to our operations 
government payers such as medicare  as well as healthcare insurers have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the costs  utilizations and delivery of healthcare services  including clinical laboratory services 
principally as a result of reimbursement reductions and measures adopted by the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  which establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes in the reimbursement process to control utilization 
despite the added cost and complexity of participating in the medicare program  we continue to participate because we believe that our other business may depend  in part  on continued participation in medicare since we believe certain ordering physicians may want a single laboratory capable of performing all of their clinical laboratory testing services  regardless of who pays for such services 
information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of the clinical laboratory operations  including testing  billing  customer service  logistics  and management of medical data 
our success depends  in part  on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems 
through maintenance  staffing  and investments in our information technology system  we expect to limit the risk associated with our heavy reliance on these systems 
the clinical laboratory is subject to seasonal fluctuations in operating results and cash flows 
typically  testing volume declines during the summer months  year end holiday periods and other major holidays  reducing net revenues and operating cash flows 
testing volume is also subject to declines in winter months due to inclement weather  which varies in severity from year to year

the real estate lease for the company s farmingdale headquarters is with a related party 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these various leases 
the following is a summary of future payments under the company s contractual obligations as of july  payments due by period in s total less than year years years over years real estate and equipment leases employment agreements total contractual cash obligations management is not aware of any material claims  disputes or settled matters concerning third party reimbursements that would have a material effect on our financial statements 
the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item a of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon enzo biochem  inc consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  these estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contractual expense  allowance for uncollectible accounts  inventory  intangible assets and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
product revenues revenues from product sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title transfers  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the revenue from these non exclusive distribution agreements are recognized when shipments are made to their respective customers and reported to the company 
the company has certain non exclusive distribution agreements  which provide for consideration to be paid to the distributors for the manufacture of certain products 
the company records such consideration provided to distributors under these non exclusive distribution agreements as a reduction to research product revenues 
the company did not recognize any revenue from these distributors during the year ended july  during the fiscal year ended july   the manufacturing and processing cost of these products sold was million 
royalties royalty revenues are recorded in the period earned 
royalties received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenues 
revenues clinical laboratory services revenues from the clinical laboratory are recognized upon completion of the testing process for a specific patient and reported to the ordering physician 
these revenues and the associated accounts receivable are based on gross amounts billed or billable for services rendered  net of a contractual expense  which is the difference between amounts billed to payers and the expected approved reimbursable settlements from such payers 
the following are tables of the clinical laboratory segment s net revenues and percentages by revenue category for the years ended july  and net revenues year ended july  year ended july  revenue category in s in in s in medicare third party payer patient self pay hmo s total the company provides services to certain patients covered by various third party payers  including the federal medicare program 
revenue  net of contractual expense  from direct billings under the federal medicare program during the years ended july    and were approximately  and  respectively  of the clinical lab segment s revenue 
laws and regulations governing medicare are complex and subject to interpretation for which action for noncompliance includes fines  penalties and exclusion from the medicare programs 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing 
contractual adjustment the company s estimate of contractual adjustment is based on significant assumptions and judgments  such as its interpretation of payer reimbursement policies  and bears the risk of change 
the estimation process is based on the experience of amounts approved as reimbursable and ultimately settled by payers  versus the corresponding gross amount billed to the respective payers 
the contractual adjustment is an estimate that reduces gross revenue  based on gross billing rates  to amounts expected to be approved and reimbursed 
gross billings are based on a standard fee schedule we set for all third party payers  including medicare  health maintenance organizations hmo s and managed care 
the company adjusts the contractual adjustment estimate quarterly  based on its evaluation of current and historical settlement experience with payers  industry reimbursement trends  and other relevant factors 
the other relevant factors that affect our contractual adjustment include the monthly and quarterly review of current gross billings and receivables and reimbursement by payer  current changes in third party arrangements 
the growth of in network provider arrangements and managed care plans specific to our company 
our clinical laboratory business is primarily dependent upon reimbursement from third party payers  such as medicare which principally serves patients and older and insurers 
we are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third party payers  as well as constant changes of reimbursement rates 
changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage would negatively impact our revenues 
the number of individuals covered under managed care contracts or other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future 
in addition  medicare and other government healthcare programs continue to shift to managed care 
these trends will continue to reduce our revenues per test 
during the years ended july   and  the contractual adjustment percentages  determined using current and historical reimbursement statistics  were  and and  respectively  of gross billings 
the company believes the negative impact on revenues from the decline in reimbursement rates or the shift to managed care  other primary third party payers  or similar arrangements may be offset by the positive impact of an increase in the number of tests we perform 
however  there can be no assurance that we can increase the number of tests we perform or that if we do increase the number of tests we perform  that we can maintain that higher number of tests performed  or that an increase in the number of tests we perform would result in increased revenue 
the company estimates by using a sensitivity analysis that each point change in the contractual adjustment percentage could result in a change in the net accounts receivable of approximately  and  as of july  and  respectively  and a change in clinical laboratory services revenues of approximately  and  for the years ended july  and  respectively 
our clinical laboratory financial billing system records gross billings using a standard fee schedule for all payers and does not record contractual adjustment by payer at the time of billing 
therefore  we are unable to quantify the effect of contractual adjustment recorded during the current period that relate to revenue recorded in a previous period 
however  we can reasonably estimate our contractual adjustment to revenue on a timely basis based on our quarterly review process  which includes an analysis of industry reimbursement trends  an evaluation of third party reimbursement rates changes and changes in reimbursement arrangements with third party payers  a rolling monthly analysis of current and historical claim settlement and reimbursement experience with payers  an analysis of current gross billings and receivables by payer 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported at realizable value  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  which is estimated and recorded in the period of the related revenue 
the following is a table of the company s net accounts receivable by segment 
the clinical labs segment s net receivables are detailed by billing category and as a percent to its total net receivables 
as of july  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s net accounts receivable relates to its clinical labs business  which operates in the new york metropolitan and new jersey areas 
as of july  as of july  net accounts receivable billing category in s in in s in clinical labs medicare third party payers patient self pay hmo s total clinical labs total life sciences total accounts receivable changes in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows in s july  july  beginning balance provision for doubtful accounts write offs ending balance for the clinical labs segment  the allowance for doubtful accounts represents amounts that the company does not expect to collect after the company has exhausted its collection procedures 
the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts in the period the related services are billed and adjusts the estimate in future accounting periods as necessary 
it bases the estimate for the allowance on the evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of accounts receivable  the historical doubtful account write off percentages  payer mix  and other relevant factors 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes the balances  after receipt of the approved settlements from third party payers for the insufficient diagnosis information received from the ordering physician  which result in denials of payment  and the uncollectible portion of receivables from self payers  including deductibles and copayments  which are subject to credit risk and patients ability to pay 
during the years ended july  and  the company determined an allowance for doubtful accounts less than days and wrote off of accounts receivable over days  as it assumed those accounts are uncollectible  except for certain fully reserved balances  principally related to medicare  until the payer s filing date deadline occurs 
the company s collection experience on medicare receivables beyond days has been insignificant 
the company adjusts the historical collection analysis for recoveries  if any  on an ongoing basis 
the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk lies with uninsured patients or patients for whom primary insurance has paid but a patient portion remains outstanding 
the company also assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on the allowance estimates  which involves judgment 
the company believes that the collectibility of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes  most notably  those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services provided 
should circumstances change eg shift in payer mix  decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of receivables  our estimates of net realizable value of receivables could be reduced by a material amount 
billing for laboratory services is complicated because of many factors  especially the differences between our standard gross fee schedule for all payers and the reimbursement rates of the various payers we deal with  disparity of coverage and information requirements among the various payers  and disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for reimbursement

under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the liability method requires that any tax benefits recognized for net operating loss carry forwards and other items be reduced by a valuation allowance where it is not more likely than not the benefits will be realized in the foreseeable future 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under the liability method  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
inventory the company values inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
work in process and finished goods inventories consist of material  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on our estimate of sales forecasts based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimate of future product demand may not be accurate and we may understate or overstate the provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
at july  and  our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was  and  respectively
