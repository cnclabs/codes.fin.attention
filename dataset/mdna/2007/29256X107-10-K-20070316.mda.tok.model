encysive pharmaceuticals inc is a biopharmaceutical company that engages in the discovery  development and commercialization of novel  synthetic  small molecule compounds to address unmet medical needs 
we focus our research and development programs predominantly on the treatment and prevention of interrelated diseases of the vascular endothelium and exploit our expertise in the area of the intravascular inflammatory process  referred to as the inflammatory cascade  and vascular diseases 
we are a multinational company with revenues from an approved product in the eu  and sales and marketing operations in several eu countries 
we have successfully developed one fda  approved drug  argatroban  for the treatment of hit  which is licensed to and marketed by gsk 
our lead drug candidate  thelin sitaxsentan sodium is an endothelin receptor antagonist for the treatment of pah 
thelin has received marketing authorization in the eu and australia  and is under review by the fda in the united states and by regulatory authorities in canada 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize royalty revenue as a licensee sells products and we have received sufficient information to record a receivable 
our royalty revenue is based on net sales of product  that is  sales net of discounts  returns and allowances 
argatroban is licensed to gsk  which distributes and sells the product  and from which royalty sub receives a quarterly royalty payment 
at the time of each payment  gsk provides us with limited quarterly data related to the product s gross sales  sales returns  discounts and allowances 
while we are informed of the amount of product returns recorded each quarter  we do not have information necessary to identify the period or periods to which such returns correspond 
we believe that substantially all discounts and allowances pertain to current period sales 
we also believe that a portion of sales recorded in each period will ultimately be returned  and therefore estimate future returns and their impact on royalty revenues 
in the pharmaceutical industry  product returns are primarily influenced by remaining or expired shelf life  product withdrawals or recalls  significant price changes from competitors or the introduction of generic products or other new competition 
we are not aware of any pending product recalls or withdrawals  significant price fluctuations or generic or new competition 
accordingly  we have estimated only the impact of product dating on returns 
since we do not manufacture  sell or distribute argatroban  we do not have information related to levels of inventory in the distribution channels 
however  due to the cost of the drug and pressures on hospitals to minimize operating expenditures  we believe inventory levels are maintained at a minimally acceptable level 
inventory level is therefore not a part of our estimate process 
we have estimated remaining shelf life  which is an important reason for product returns  based upon the fact that argatroban has an expiration date of two years from manufacture 
common industry practice is that prescription drugs can be returned to the manufacturer at any time  however  product is normally returned when the remaining shelf life is reduced to six months or less 
our reserve is therefore based upon an estimate of the percentage of sales made in the preceding month period that may be returned in future periods 
initially  lacking any historical sales data for argatroban and based upon management s experience with other pharmaceutical products in the industry  management estimated that four percent of gross sales of argatroban would be returned during future periods 
based upon subsequent analysis of historical sales data  we believe that differences between estimated and actual future returns will not have a material effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
revenue from collaborative research and development activities is recognized as services are performed 
we defer the recognition of milestone payments related to contractual agreements that are still in the development stage 
such deferred revenues are amortized into income over the estimated remaining development period 
milestone payments received under contractual agreements which have completed the development stage are evaluated  and either recognized into income when earned  or amortized over a future period  depending upon whether we continue to have obligations under the terms of the arrangement 
license fees received under the terms of licensing agreements for our intellectual property are deferred and amortized into income over the estimated development period of the licensed item or items 

table of contents revenue from grants is recognized as earned under the terms of the related grant agreements  typically as expenses are incurred 
revenue from sales of thelin is recognized when product is shipped and title transfers to the customer 
sales revenue is reported net of discounts  allowances  and returns  but included vat charged to customers 
amounts received in advance of services being performed under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue  and recognized as services are performed 
we periodically evaluate our estimates of remaining development periods  and adjust the recognition of remaining deferred revenues over the adjusted development period remaining 
at december   remaining deferred revenue was approximately million  which we expect to recognize over the next months 
a future change in our estimate of development periods could accelerate or decelerate the timing of future recognition of deferred revenue 
cost of goods sold we began pre license sales of thelin in the uk in july utilizing the services of a third party 
after receipt of marketing approval by emea in august  thelin became commercially available through third party distributors in the uk and in germany during late cost of goods sold is comprised of the direct cost of inventory consumed  along with the fees associated with the third party 
share based payments at december   we had five stock based compensation plans for employees and non employee directors 
prior to january   the company accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations apb 
share based employee compensation expense related to stock options was not recognized in the company s consolidated statements of earnings prior to january   as all stock option awards granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation expense recognized during year  included i compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  and ii compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with fas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
the adoption of fas r resulted in a reduction of net earnings of  or per share basic and diluted  in year  arising from unvested stock options 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further detail on the impact of fas r on the company s consolidated financial statements 
drug manufacturing and packaging costs arising from the manufacturing and packaging of drug product  which is intended for use in clinical trials  are recognized as incurred and included in research and development expenses 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval or pre launch inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to a denial or additional delays of approval by regulatory bodies  additional delays in commercialization  or other potential factors 
at december   we determined  based upon inventory production plans  expiration dates of product on hand and projected future sales  that we should record a reserve for inventory obsolescence of approximately  at december   we had million of capitalized inventory costs  net of the reserve for obsolescence 
costs related to issue of long term debt costs incurred in the issuance of the convertible notes  primarily comprised of initial purchasers discounts  legal and other professional fees have been deferred  and will be amortized and reported as a component of interest expense during the periods beginning with the issuance date of the convertible notes to the date that we have the ability to call the debt 
results of operations the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly during each quarter and year  and we anticipate that such fluctuations  which are largely attributable to increasing commercialization expenditures  will continue for the next several years 
we have been 
table of contents unprofitable to date and expect to make substantial expenditures during the next several years as we invest in launching thelin in europe  and maintenance of the commercial infrastructure necessary to launch thelin in the us we have sustained net losses of approximately million from the date of our inception to december  we have primarily financed our operations to date through a series of private placements and public offerings of our common stock and convertible debt  debt issued by our subsidiary that is secured by royalties on argatroban and from funds received through our collaborations  research agreements and partnerships 
see discussion of liquidity and capital resources below 
in april  the stockholders of revotar  our former majority owned german subsidiary  agreed to restructure revotar s capitalization 
following the completion of the restructuring  our consolidated financial statements no longer include the results of revotar 
we recorded a gain of approximately million upon its disposal of revotar  which is included in the amount reported under the caption gain loss from discontinued operations in our financial statements for year for additional information about revotar  see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
results for years and have been restated to reflect the classification of revotar as a discontinued operation during  with no change in reported net loss 
year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenues revenues in year increased million  to million from million in year the increase is primarily due to higher royalties earned on higher sales of argatroban by gsk in year royalties increased to million  from million in as a result of the recent sale of the argatroban notes by our subsidiary  future royalty revenues from sales of argatroban will be used to pay interest and to repay the argatroban notes  and will not be available to fund our operations until the argatroban notes are repaid in full 
we began pre license sales of thelin in the uk in july utilizing the services of a third party 
after receipt of marketing approval by emea in august  thelin became commercially available through third party distributors in the uk and in germany during late we reported sales of thelin of approximately million in we have just started to commercialize thelin in europe  and as such  cannot make any sales projections or financial forecasts 
as the outcome of our regulatory filings with the fda and other regulatory authorities is uncertain  we are unable to project revenues for thelin in the us and other countries 
even though we have received regulatory approval to market thelin in europe  and are hopeful that we may receive regulatory approval to market thelin in the us  significant uncertainties make it difficult to forecast or predict future sales 
these uncertainties include the market acceptance of thelin  reimbursement policies of third party payers and the speed with which government or other third party payers grant pricing and reimbursement approvals  competitive activity  the timing of competitive product approvals  and other factors impacting the timing and speed of our product launch  could materially affect any revenue projections cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in of approximately million was primarily comprised of the cost to manufacture  finish and package thelin sold in europe 
research and development expenses research and development expense in was comparable to  and was primarily comprised of the costs of ongoing long term safety studies of thelin  and with expenses related to various regulatory submissions for thelin 
as discussed below  we have restricted research and development activities to those necessary to maintain our existing programs  and have deferred additional projects until the second half of if we do not receive fda approval to sell thelin in the us  we may be required to make further reductions in our research and development activities 
if we do receive fda approval and are successful in obtaining additional funding  research and development activities in would remain significant as we would expect to continue to invest in our research pipeline 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to costs associated with preparation for the commercial launch in the eu and the anticipated commercial launch of thelin in the us this included the addition of a us sales force and related sales launch preparation activities 
we have made thelin commercially available in the uk and germany  are actively preparing for the commercial launch of thelin throughout europe  having added a vice president of european sales and marketing and a european headquarters staff 
we have hired a sales force in the uk and in germany 
we expect sales and marketing expenses in to continue to increase over  as we commercially launch thelin in europe 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below  our current liquidity position will limit our commercialization activities in the us to those that we deem necessary to maintain the ability to commercially launch thelin in the us if we receive fda approval 
if we do receive fda approval and are successful in obtaining additional funding  sales and marketing expenses in

we expect general and administrative expenses in to increase over as we continue to build the infrastructure to commercially operate in europe 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below  we will restrict general and administrative activities in the us to those that we deem essential to maintain our operations

year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenues revenues in year increased million  to million from million in year the increase is primarily due to higher royalties earned on higher sales of argatroban by gsk in year royalties increased to million  from million in license fees  milestones and grants increased million in year  due to receipt of an additional milestone payment from schering plough in march the increased royalties and license fees  milestones and grants were partially offset by the end

liquidity and capital resources while the consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern  because of our losses and need for additional financing to execute our business strategy  our independent auditor s report on our consolidated financial statements contains a statement relating to their substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
at december  we had cash and investments of million  and at march   after the receipt of net proceeds from the sale by royalty sub of the argatroban notes described below  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
to date  we have financed our research and development activities and other operations primarily through public and private offerings of common stock  including an equity financing line with azimuth  proceeds from the issuance and sale of our convertible notes  funds received through collaborations  research agreements  licenses and partnerships  royalty revenue from sales of argatroban  and the recent sale by royalty sub of the argatroban notes 
although  we have recently received additional funds from our equity financing line with azimuth described below and from the sale by royalty sub of the argatroban notes  we will require additional funding to continue to operate as a going concern  whether or not thelin is approved in the us by the fda  as described 
table of contents in more detail below 
subject to certain conditions  we may issue and sell up to  shares of our common stock to azimuth under the equity financing line and may receive million upon the confirmation of treaty relief from uk withholding obligations pursuant to the terms of the argatroban notes 
we may also issue common stock  debt  or other securities for gross aggregate proceeds of million pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement 
however  we cannot assure you that such funding will be available under commercially acceptable terms 
outlook for until recently  the majority of our financial resources have been dedicated to the research and development of argatroban  thelin and other drug compounds 
beginning in  we have spent an increasing percentage of our financial resources on preparations for the anticipated commercial launch of thelin in the us  and more recently  in building the commercial infrastructure necessary to successfully launch thelin in europe 
as described below  this trend is expected to continue as we expand our commercial organization in europe and continue to invest in us launch preparations for thelin 
while we continue to invest in developing several new drug compounds  we currently do not have any drug candidates that are likely to be commercialized in the near future other than thelin 
we have just started to commercialize thelin in europe  and as such  cannot make any projections or financial forecasts of sales or operating expenses 
we believe  however  that the commercial launch of thelin in europe and the anticipated launch of thelin in the us and other countries will require additional funding due to higher levels of sales and marketing expenditures  particularly in europe  than in recent periods 
as the outcomes of our regulatory filings with the fda and other regulatory authorities are uncertain  we are unable to project revenues for thelin in the us and other countries 
even though we have received regulatory approval to market thelin in europe  significant uncertainties make it difficult to forecast or predict future sales 
these uncertainties include the market acceptance of thelin  the reimbursement policies of third party payors  the speed with which government or other third party payors grant pricing and reimbursement approvals  competitive activity  the timing of competitive product approvals  and other factors impacting the timing and speed of our product launch  all of which could materially affect any revenue projections 
based upon our current cash position of million as of march  and expected future cash requirements  we will require additional funding in in order to continue our ongoing research and development programs  and to fund the commercial launch of thelin in europe  whether thelin is approved in the us by the fda or not 
because the fda has designed thelin as a class resubmission and assigned a new pdufa action date of june   we believe that additional funding will be significantly more difficult to obtain on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we are considering various alternatives to reduce our expenses in order to sustain our cash resources 
those measures include scaling back personnel and expenses  delaying or terminating research and development programs  curtailing capital expenditures  and reducing other operating expenses 
we may also consider relinquishing  licensing or otherwise disposing of rights to technologies or product candidates that we could otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or at an earlier stage than would otherwise be desirable  including the possibility of licensing rights to thelin outside north america and europe 
even if thelin is approved by the fda  we believe that we will require additional funding for increased spending required to commercially launch thelin in the us if we receive approval by the fda to market thelin in the us  and if we are successful in obtaining additional funding  we believe that our operating expenses will exceed those incurred in if we do not receive approval by the fda  we may be required to restructure our operations to significantly reduce our operating expenses 
in any event  we anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses throughout years and cash flows from operating activities at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of million compared with million at december  we used million in cash from operating activities in year compared to cash used by operating activities of million in the primary operating uses of cash in were to fund the building of a corporate infrastructure to support the anticipated commercial launch of thelin  pay interest on to the convertible notes  fund our general operating expenses and the ongoing research and development programs  reduced by cash received from investment income 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities are primarily comprised of our investments in debt securities 
cash is generated from investment activities when marketable securities mature  the resulting cash is utilized primarily to fund operating activities 
investing activities in consisted of purchases of equipment of million 
to maximize liquidity in  we invested our available funds in cash equivalent securities  having original maturities of less than days 
in  we generated million in investing activities  reflecting the maturities of marketable debt securities  partially offset by purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements of million 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities cash provided by financing activities in year was million  compared with million in financing activities in consisted of net proceeds from two draw downs under our equity financing line with azimuth described below totaling million  and million proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
financing activities in year primarily consisted of net proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes  and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on the convertible notes 
on october   we entered into an equity financing line with azimuth pursuant to which azimuth is committed to purchase up to million shares of our common stock or  shares of our common stock  whichever occurs first  over the month term of the financing line  subject to certain conditions 
to date  we have closed two draw down requests under the financing line pursuant to which we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting estimated offering expenses  and issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
we can sell and issue up to  additional shares to azimuth prior to the expiration of the financing line  subject to certain conditions 
on february   our wholly owned subsidiary  royalty sub  issued the argatroban notes  for which we received approximately million of net proceeds  after deducting transaction costs  of which million was withheld from us pending confirmation of treaty relief from uk withholding tax obligations 
once tax treaty relief is confirmed  the amount withheld will be released to us 
if tax treaty relief is not received by march   the amount withheld will be used to pay interest on and principal of the argatroban notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a more complete description of the terms of the argatroban notes 
we also have an effective shelf registration statement  under which we could be eligible to issue common stock  debt  or other securities for gross aggregate proceeds of up to million 
we cannot assure you whether any of these financing arrangements will be available under commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations at december   our material contractual obligations were comprised of i million in convertible senior notes  ii obligations under our operating lease agreements see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein  and iii under one research agreement  we could be obligated to pay the other party a termination fee in the event that we elect to terminate the project prior to completion see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we are obligated to make semi annual interest payments on the convertible notes of totaling approximately million per year 
as of december   the company had contractual obligations as follows in thousands 
less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases total in addition to the above  royalty sub is obligated to repay million in argatroban notes  which were issued in february see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a more complete description of the terms of the argatroban notes
