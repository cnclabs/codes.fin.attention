item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a major manufacturer of recycled paperboard and converted paperboard products 
we operate in four business segments 
the paperboard segment manufactures recycled uncoated and clay coated paperboard and operates a specialty converting operation 
the recovered fiber segment collects and sells recycled paper and brokers recycled paper and other paper rolls 
the tube  core and composite container segment produces spiral and convolute wound tubes  cores and cans 
the folding carton and custom packaging segment produces printed and unprinted folding cartons and set up boxes 
our business is vertically integrated to a large extent 
this means that our converting operations consume a large portion of our own paperboard production  approximately in the remaining of our paperboard production is sold to external customers in any of the four recycled paperboard end use markets tube  core and composite containers  folding cartons  gypsum wallboard facing paper  and specialty paperboard products 
these integration statistics do not include volume produced or converted by our owned  unconsolidated joint venture premier boxboard 
as part of our strategy to optimize our operating efficiency  each of our mills can produce recycled paperboard for more than one end use market 
this allows us to shift production among mills in response to customer or market demands 
more recently  in light of the difficult operating climate we have faced  and in an effort to reduce costs and improve our business mix  capacity deployment and profitability  restructuring activities have become an important element of our strategy 
the previous sales of our interest in standard gypsum and our corrugated box plant and partition businesses  as well as the recent sale of our two coated recycled paperboard mills and our specialty packaging businesses  are all part of our strategic transformation plan to reduce our debt and better position ourselves to compete and leverage our expertise in our core businesses 
we are a holding company that operates our business through subsidiaries as of the date of this filing 
we also own a interest in a joint venture with temple inland 
we have two additional joint ventures with unrelated entities in which our investment and share of earnings are immaterial 
we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting 
see liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements joint venture financings below 
key business indicator and trends historically  demand in our industry has been closely correlated with the domestic economy in general  and with consumer nondurable consumption packaging segment and industrial production tube  core and composite containers segment  specifically 
demand tends to be cyclical in nature  with cycles lasting three to five years depending on gross domestic product  interest rates and other factors 
as these demand drivers fluctuate  we typically experience variability in volume  revenue and profitability in our business 
from late through  the recycled paperboard and converted paperboard products industry was in a down cycle 
since our industry has improved but has not returned to historical levels of demand and capacity utilization 
while we believe that future operating results may improve  we cannot ascertain when or to what extent this may occur 
the key operating indicator of our business is paperboard mill operating rates 
mill operating rates are calculated as the ratio of production compared with capacity  assuming a normalized mill schedule of days per year 
as paperboard mill operating rates increase  cost per ton of paperboard generally decreases 
as these tons are sold  profitability increases since fixed production costs are absorbed by more tons produced 
additionally  higher operating rates generally provide enhanced opportunity to recover material and labor increases through improved pricing 
this positively affects paperboard and converted products income from operations and cash flow 

table of contents paperboard mill operating rates are affected by demand and by mill closures 
industry demand decreased from to due primarily to a recessionary general economy  the continued migration of us manufacturing offshore to find lower labor cost and product substitution such as the replacement of paperboard carton packaging with plastic standup pouches 
the decrease in demand resulted in a decrease in operating rates for us and the industry as a whole 
we expect the migration of us manufacturing offshore and product substitution to continue  although at a slower rate  which could continue to negatively affect operating results 
we further expect these trends to be somewhat offset by the improving domestic economy  increased market share and our own paperboard mill capacity reductions 
logo industry source american forest and paper association 
restructuring has been a primary component of management s strategy to address the decrease in demand resulting from secular trends  as discussed above  and generally weak domestic economic conditions 
between and  restructuring and impairment costs have totaled million  of which approximately million have been noncash charges  see results of operations and results of operations we have also experienced increases in near term manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs as a result of our transitioning of business within our mill and converting systems to other company facilities 
our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our competitiveness through reduced costs  increase revenue through delivery of differentiated quality products and services to our customers  and promote compliance with recent changes in legal and regulatory requirements 
our restructuring efforts have been directed toward reducing costs through manufacturing and converting facilities rationalization where we believed it was advantageous to do so due to geographic overlap  duplicative capabilities  changes in customer base and other factors 
rationalization of facilities typically results in increased cash outlays and expenses initially  for example  severance costs 
restructuring charges decreased in versus and we believe that future earnings and cash flows will be favorably impacted by our continued efforts to reconfigure our business to increase efficiency and better match supply with customer demand 
recovered fiber  which is derived from recycled paper stock  is our most significant raw material 
historically  the cost of recovered fiber has fluctuated significantly due to market and industry conditions 
for example  our average recovered fiber cost per ton of paperboard produced increased from per ton in to per ton in  an increase of  before dropping to per ton in recovered fiber cost per ton averaged approximately and during and  respectively 

table of contents excluding raw materials and labor  energy is our most significant manufacturing cost 
energy consists of fuel used to generate steam used in the paper making process and electrical purchases to operate our paperboard machines and all of our converting machinery 
in  the average energy cost in our mill system was approximately per ton compared to per ton in  a increase 
in energy costs averaged per ton  an increase of from until the last several years  our business had not been significantly affected by fluctuating energy costs  and we historically have not passed increases in energy costs through to our customers 
as the volatility of energy prices has increased dramatically over the last three years  we have not been able to pass through to our customers all of the energy cost increases we have incurred 
as a result  our operating margins have been adversely affected 
although we continue to evaluate our energy costs and consider ways to factor energy costs into our pricing  we cannot give assurance that our operating margins and results of operations will not continue to be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
see part i  item  risk factors our operating margins may be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
we raise our selling prices in response to increases in raw material and energy costs 
however  we often are unable to pass the full amount of these costs through to our customers on a timely basis due to supply and demand in the industry  and as a result often cannot maintain our operating margins in the face of dramatic cost increases 
we experience margin shrinkage during all periods of cost increases due to customary time lags in implementing our price increases 
we cannot give assurance that we will be able to recover any future increases in the cost of recovered fiber by raising the prices of our products 
even if we are able to recover future cost increases  our operating margins and results of operations may still be materially and adversely affected by time delays in the implementation of price increases 
see part i  item  risk factors our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by future increases in raw material and other operating costs 
critical accounting policies our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves forming estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause future reported financial conditions and results of operations to differ materially from financial results reported based on management s current estimates 
changes in these estimates are recorded periodically based on updated information 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue and the related account receivable when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
generally  we recognize revenue when we ship our manufactured products or when we complete a service and title and risk of loss passes to our customers 
provisions for discounts  returns  allowances  customer rebates and other adjustments which have averaged less than of sales for the years ended december   and are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are determined based on historical experience or specific customer arrangements 
accounts receivable 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
when we become aware of a customer whose financial viability is questionable  we closely monitor collection of their receivable balance and may require the customer to prepay for future shipments 
if a customer enters a 
table of contents bankruptcy action  we monitor the progress of that action to determine when and if an additional provision for noncollectibility is warranted 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december   and was million  million and million  respectively  and our provision for uncollectible accounts was million  thousand and million for the years ending  and  respectively 
the decline in our provision during primarily resulted from recoveries of previously reserved accounts 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
inventory 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes raw material recovered fiber for paperboard products and paperboard for converted products  direct and indirect labor and employee benefits  energy and fuel  depreciation  chemicals  general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management reviews inventory at least quarterly to determine the necessity of write offs for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
inventory over six months old is generally deemed unsaleable at first quality prices unless customer arrangements or other special circumstances exist 
we reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on management s judgment of future realization 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the write offs required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory  however  in  and  these write offs  other than those related to specific customer bankruptcies  were insignificant 
goodwill 
we test the carrying amount of goodwill at least annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
impairment testing is performed in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes  growth rates of selling prices and costs  changes in working capital  investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
we also test the sensitivities of fair value estimates to changes in our growth assumptions of sales volumes  selling prices and costs 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit that contains goodwill exceeds fair value  a possible impairment is indicated 
if a possible impairment is indicated  we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit attributed to those net assets 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recorded 
we also use judgment in assessing whether we should test more frequently for impairment than annually 
factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions  competition  product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments 
in december  we recognized certain impairment indicators related to our decision  at that time  to exit the coated recycled paperboard business 
as a result  we retested our goodwill as of december  and recorded impairment charges of approximately million in our paperboard segment and million in our folding carton and custom packaging segment 
the goodwill impairment recorded in our folding carton and custom packaging segment resulted from the expected loss of synergies that existed between the coated recycled paperboard business and the folding carton and custom packaging segment resulting from the proposed disposition of the coated recycled paperboard business at that time 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment test was performed in november and did not result in any additional goodwill impairment 
we believe that our remaining goodwill balance of million as of december  is not impaired 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in conditions may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important that could initiate an impairment review include the following significant operating losses recurring operating losses significant declines in demand for a product produced by an asset capable of producing only that product assets that are idled or held for sale assets that are likely to be divested the impairment review requires management to estimate future undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset or group of assets and sum the estimated future cash flows 
if the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  then we must estimate the fair value of the asset 
if the fair value of the asset is below the carrying value  then the difference will be written off 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of the asset or group of assets may materially affect our asset values and results of operations 
impairment charges of million  million and million related to property  plant and equipment were recorded in  and  respectively 
of these amounts thousand  million and thousand were recorded in discontinued operations during  and  respectively 
during and  respectively  approximately million and million of the impairments were related to the disposition of the sprague  connecticut and rittman  ohio coated paperboard mills 
the assets impaired include real estate and machinery and equipment related to operations that permanently closed in conjunction with our restructuring activities  discontinued businesses and routine asset disposals 
the charges represent the difference between the carrying value of the assets and the estimated fair value 
fair value for assets held for sale as of december  were estimated based on considerations of preliminary indication of values from potential buyers  supported by industry multiples of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  discounted cash flows  and broker s opinions of value for real estate 
real estate held for sale as of december  of million is recorded as a component of other current assets 
self insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and health care costs  subject to specific retention levels 
consulting actuaries and administrators assist us in determining our liability for self insured claims 
our self insured workers compensation liability is estimated based on actual claims as established by a third party administrator  increased by factors that reflect our historical claim development 
the developed claim  net of amounts paid and discounted to present value  represents the liability that we record in our financial statements 
the primary controllable driver of our workers compensation liability is the loss development factor that estimates the amount to which one dollar in actual claims incurred will ultimately grow over the life of the claim  which may be several years 
a increase in the loss development factors utilized for would have resulted in a thousand increase in workers compensation expense and accrued liability at december  our self insured health care liability is estimated based on our actual claim experience and multiplied by a time lag factor of days 
the lag factor represents an estimate of the number of days based on historical experience that claims have been incurred but not yet reported and  therefore  should be recorded as a liability 
a increase in the lag factor would have resulted in a thousand increase in our healthcare costs and accrued liability at december  future actual costs related to self insured coverages will depend on claims incurred  medical cost trends which have increased in recent years  safety performance  and various other factors related to our employee population  which has decreased in recent years 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs 

table of contents accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses carried forward and state tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on our statement of operations and our balance sheet 
at december  and  we had net federal and state deferred tax assets related to net operating losses of million and million  respectively 
at december  and we established valuation allowances of million and million for a portion of these deferred tax assets  respectively 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we maintain a noncontributory  defined benefit pension plan the pension plan 
the pension plan provides benefits to be paid to all eligible employees at retirement based primarily on years of service with the company and compensation rates in effect near retirement 
our policy is to fund benefits attributed to employees services to date as well as service expected to be earned in the future 
during september  we contributed million to the pension plan and there were no contributions made in no contribution was required or made during based on our current estimate of future funding requirements  we expect to make contributions between million and million during in september  we announced the suspension of any further pension benefits for certain employees covered by the pension plan 
the suspension was effective as of december  and froze the accrued pension benefits for employees not subject to a collective bargaining agreement and employees who do not qualify for continued benefits based on years of service and age requirements 
the curtailment reduced our december  projected benefit obligation by million and increased pension expense by thousand 
certain executives participate in a supplemental executive retirement plan serp  which provides retirement benefits to participants based on average compensation 
the serp was unfunded at december  the determination of our pension plan and serp benefit obligations and expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the weighted average discount rate  the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets and the weighted average rate of compensation increase 
the following table is a summary of the significant assumptions we used to determine our pension plan s projected benefit obligation as of serp pension plan weighted average discount rate weighted average rate of compensation increase 
table of contents the following table is a summary of the significant assumptions to determine net periodic pension expense for the years ended serp pension plan weighted average discount rate weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets n a n a n a weighted average rate of compensation increase in developing the weighted average discount rate  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including estimated timing of obligation payments and yields for long term bonds that received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate  determined on this basis  was and at december  and  respectively 
based on analysis of the rating and maturity of the long term bonds  the timing of payment obligations and the input from our actuaries  we concluded that a discount rate of is appropriate and reflects the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds that has the same duration as the plan obligations 
future actual pension expense and benefit obligations will depend on future investment performance  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to populations participating in our pension plans 
a change in the discount rate would result in a change in the december  projected benefit obligation of approximately million and estimated net pension expense of approximately thousand 
in developing our weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets  we evaluated such criteria as return expectations by asset class and long term inflation assumptions 
our expected weighted average rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of approximately equity  fixed income and investment in a portfolio of hedge funds 
we regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that the expected weighted average rate of return of for december  should remain the same for december  a change in the weighted average expected rate of return would change estimated net pension expense thousand 
no contribution was required or made in  however  based on our current estimate of future fund requirements  we expect to make contributions between million and million during although no contribution was required in  we contributed million in the third quarter of primarily as a result of higher investment returns and a lower discount rate  the under funded status of our pension plan and the serp decreased by approximately million in we believe the change in our mortality assumptions is more representative of the plan s participant demographics 
while we believe that the assumptions we have used are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension plan and serp liability 
we also provide postretirement medical benefits at certain of our subsidiaries 
our net periodic postretirement benefit cost for medical costs was approximately thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at december  and were determined using a weighted average discount rate of and  respectively 
the rate of increase in the costs of covered health care benefits is assumed to be in  decreasing to by the year increasing or decreasing the assumed health care costs trend rate by one percentage point would have increased or decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately thousand and thousand  respectively and this would have increased or decreased net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately thousand and thousand  respectively  for the year ended december  in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

depreciation 
management is required to make estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of long lived assets 
these estimates can significantly affect depreciation expense and accordingly  both results of operations and the asset values reflected on the balance sheet 
results of operations the volume information shown below includes shipments of paperboard products excluding volume shipped by our unconsolidated joint ventures combined and presented by end use market as well as by reporting segments

total paperboard volume from continuing operations for the year ended december   decreased to thousand tons from  thousand tons for the same period in tons sold from paperboard mill production decreased in the total volume of paperboard converted was essentially unchanged with only a slight increase of for the year ended december  total paperboard volume decreased due to a decrease in sales of unconverted paperboard to the folding carton and the specialty paperboard products end use markets  combined with lower converted volume in the tube  core and composite container and the folding carton and custom packaging segments 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of unconverted paperboard to the tube  core and composite container and the gypsum wallboard facing paper markets as well as higher sales of converted paperboard to the specialty paperboard market

our consolidated sales for the year ended december   increased by to million from million for the same period in the following table presents sales by business segment in thousands years ended december  change change paperboard recovered fiber tube  core and composite container folding carton and custom packaging total paperboard segment sales for the paperboard segment decreased due to lower volume which accounted for million of the decrease and was primarily due to the disposition of our rittman and sprague coated paperboard mills 
this decrease was partially offset by higher selling prices in our uncoated paperboard operations which accounted for an estimated increase of million in sales 
recovered fiber segment sales for the recovered fiber segment increased primarily due to higher volume and selling prices 
the increased volume was primarily due to increased sales to our owned joint venture  premier boxboard  which accounted for approximately million of the million increase 
tube  core and composite container segment sales for the tube  core and composite container segment decreased primarily due to lower volume  as a result of soft industry conditions  which accounted for a decrease of million 
this decrease was partially offset by higher tube  core and composite container selling prices which accounted for an estimated increase of million in sales 
folding carton and custom packaging segment sales for the carton and custom packaging segment increased primarily due to million in sales from the carolina carton plant which was acquired from sonoco products company on december  this increase in sales was partially offset by lower volume of approximately million resulting from closing and consolidating operations and eliminating customers with low margins and high credit risk 

table of contents cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december  increased million from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the following factors higher recovered fiber costs of approximately million due to higher volume in the recovered fiber segment 
higher freight costs of million 
higher energy and fuel costs of million in the paperboard segment 
higher employee labor and benefit costs of million in the paperboard segment 
higher direct material costs of million in the folding carton and custom packaging segment primarily due to higher sales 
higher repairs and maintenance expense of million in the paperboard segment 
higher other manufacturing costs of million in the folding carton and custom packaging segment primarily due to accelerated depreciation expenses related to plant closures 
higher direct material costs of million in the paperboard segment primarily due to higher volume 
higher labor costs of million in the folding carton and custom packaging segment 
accelerated depreciation expense of approximately million in the paperboard segment related to a mill closure 
these factors were partially offset by the following improvements lower direct materials costs  energy and fuel costs  depreciation expense  and other manufacturing costs of approximately million in the paperboard segment primarily due to the disposition of the rittman and sprague coated paperboard mills in lower direct material costs of million in the tube  core and composite container segment primarily due to lower volume 
lower indirect labor costs and employee benefit expenses of million in the tube  core and composite container segment primarily due to lower workers compensation expenses and lower group health costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   decreased by to million from million for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the following factors elimination of approximately million in selling  general and administrative expenses in the paperboard segment due to ceasing manufacturing operations at the rittman  ohio mill and the divestiture of the sprague  connecticut coated mill 
lower expenses in the information technology department of million primarily due to lower employee salaries expenses  equipment lease expenses  and outside professional services costs 
these factors were partially offset by the following expenses an expense of million related to the settlement of a patent infringement dispute in higher accounts receivable reserve expense of million in the recovered fiber segment 
a million increase in equity based compensation expense 
a thousand increase in expenses related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning software system 
an expense of thousand for deferred compensation related to the retirement of an officer of the company 
restructuring and impairment costs

equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates was million for the year december   a decrease of million in equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates of million in the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of our interest in standard gypsum  a joint venture with temple inland  whereby  effective january   we were no longer entitled to earnings or distributions from standard gypsum  this accounted for approximately million of the million decrease 
benefit provision for income taxes 
the effective rate of income tax expense on continuing operations for the year ended december  was compared with an income tax benefit of for the same period in the effective rates for both periods are different from the statutory rates due to permanent tax adjustments

in addition  certain volume was transferred to our owned  unconsolidated premier boxboard mill 
lower converted sales to the tube  core and composite container  the folding carton  and the specialty paperboard markets also contributed to the decline 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of unconverted paperboard to the folding carton and the specialty paperboard markets

net loss 
due to the factors discussed above  net loss for was million  or net loss per common share  compared to net loss of million  or net loss per common share  in liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources and risks 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility  described below 
downturns in operations can significantly affect our ability to generate cash 
factors that can affect our operating results and liquidity are discussed further in this annual report under risk factors in part i  item a 
at december  we had million of cash on hand and million borrowing availability under our senior credit facility 
we believe that our cash on hand together with our borrowing availability under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next months 
however  it is likely that we will refinance our million outstanding senior notes due in june we are evaluating various refinancing alternatives 
if we are unable to generate cash at projected levels  our ability to generate cash sufficient to meet our long term requirements is uncertain 
some of the factors that could affect our future ability to generate cash from operations are as follows a contraction in domestic demand for recycled paperboard and related packaging products similar to what our industry experienced in  and 
table of contents increased market acceptance of alternative products  such as flexible packaging and plastics that have replaced or can replace certain of our packaging products 
continued export of domestic industrial manufacturing operations 
continued increase in fuel and energy costs 
market acceptance of price increases and energy surcharges in response to rising operating costs 
significant unforeseen adverse conditions in our industry or the markets we serve 
the occurrence  continuation or exacerbation of these conditions could require us to seek additional funds from external sources in order to meet our liquidity requirements 
in such event  our ability to obtain additional funds would depend on the various business and credit market conditions prevailing at the time  which are difficult to predict and many of which are out of our control 
our ability to secure additional funds could also be materially adversely affected by our substantial indebtedness 
additional risks related to our substantial indebtedness are discussed in part i  item a of this annual report under risk factors our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness 
the availability of liquidity from our senior credit facility is primarily affected by our collateral base and our continued compliance with the terms of the senior credit facility  including the payment of interest and compliance with various covenants and financial maintenance tests 
we were in compliance with the covenants under our senior credit facility during absent a deterioration of the us economy as a whole or the specific sectors on which our business depends see part i  item a  risk factors our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by downturns in industrial production  housing and construction and the consumption of nondurable and durable goods  we believe we will be in compliance with our covenants under the senior credit agreement for the next months

the five year revolver was reduced from million to million in october the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and our domestic subsidiaries other than real property  including accounts receivable  general intangibles  inventory and equipment 
our domestic subsidiaries are parties to the senior credit facility either as co borrowers with us or as guarantors 
at december  we had million outstanding under the five year term loan and million outstanding under the revolver 
the revolver matures on the fifth anniversary of closing and includes a sublimit of million for letters of credit 
borrowing availability under the revolver is determined by reference to a borrowing base  defined as specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory and reduced by usage of the revolver  including outstanding letters of credit  and any reserves 
aggregate availability under the revolver was million at december  the term loan was drawn in full at closing and is required to be repaid in monthly installments based on a level six year amortization schedule  with all remaining outstanding principal due on the fifth anniversary of closing 
outstanding principal of the term loan initially bears interest at a rate equal to  at our option  either the base rate which is the prime rate most recently announced by bank of america  na  the administrative agent under the senior credit facility plus  or the adjusted one  two  three or six month libor rate plus

the publicly traded senior subordinated notes were  and the senior notes are  unsecured but guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by all but one of the company s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
during and  we purchased million and million  respectively  of senior subordinated and senior notes in the open market 
on may   we redeemed our outstanding senior subordinated notes in full at a price of for each of outstanding principal amount of the notes plus million of accrued and unpaid interest from april  to may  at the time of redemption  the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes was million  and the total redemption price including accrued and unpaid interest and redemption premium was million 
we used proceeds from borrowings at closing under the senior credit facility  together with available cash  to fund the redemption 
the redemption resulted in a million loss  which was recognized in may of we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as long term debt and lease agreements 
see contractual obligations below and the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which detail these future obligations and commitments 
interest rate swap agreements 
historically  we have used interest rate swaps to effectively convert our fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate obligations 
this strategy has been employed in order to effect an optimal balance between fixed rate and variable rate obligations since  historically  variable rate debt obligations are lower cost than fixed rate debt 
during and we entered into several interest rates swaps and then unwound those swaps opportunistically for a gain 
these gains provided cash to us upon unwinding and lowered our interest expense over the remaining duration of the related debt obligation 
during we did not enter into any interest rate swap agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements joint venture financings 
on january  we completed the sale of our interest in our joint venture standard gypsum to the joint venture s other partner  temple inland  for million in cash and eliminated our guaranty and letter of credit support obligations with respect to standard gypsum s debt 
as a result of this sale  we no longer have any support obligation with respect to our half of standard gypsum s debt  which was million as of december   and we ceased to be entitled to any distributions from standard gypsum for all periods subsequent to january  we provided certain environmental indemnification not to exceed million for any claims related to events that occurred prior to the formation of the standard gypsum joint venture on april  this indemnification will terminate january  we did not record a liability related to this indemnification since the probability of an asserted claim was considered remote 
as of december  we owned a interest in one joint venture  premier boxboard llc  with temple inland 
because we account for the interest in this joint venture under the equity method of accounting  the indebtedness of the joint venture is not reflected in the liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheets 
premier boxboard is a low cost recycled paperboard mill that produces a lightweight gypsum facing paper along with containerboard grades 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report for summarized financial information for this joint venture 
funding for premier boxboard is generated by its internal cash flow and any cash contributions that we and our joint venture partner are required to make 
premier boxboard generated sufficient cash flow in to 
table of contents distribute million to us and million to our joint venture partner 
based on the cash flows and expected future cash flows  we do not expect premier boxboard to require external funding in the foreseeable future 
however  if premier boxboard were to require additional funding  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we and our joint venture partner were unable to adequately satisfy premier boxboard s funding requirements  its operations  and accordingly  our interest in it  could be adversely affected 
in addition  a substantial portion of the assets of premier boxboard are pledged as security for million in outstanding principal amount of senior notes under which premier boxboard is the obligor 
these notes are guaranteed by temple inland  but are not guaranteed by us 
in the event of a default under these notes  the holders would also have recourse to the assets of premier boxboard that are pledged to secure these notes 
thus  any resulting default under these notes could result in the assets of premier boxboard being utilized to satisfy creditor claims  which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operations of premier boxboard and  accordingly  our interest in premier boxboard 
as of december   premier boxboard was in compliance with its debt covenants 
additional contingencies relating to our premier boxboard joint venture that could affect our liquidity include possible additional capital contributions and buy sell triggers which  under certain circumstances  give us and our joint venture partner either the right  or the obligation  to purchase the other s interest or to sell an interest to the other 
we are required  to the extent necessary  to make additional capital contributions to enable the joint venture to meet existing obligations 
under the premier boxboard joint venture agreement  in general  mutual buy sell rights are triggered upon the occurrence of involuntary transfers  and in the event of change of control  actual or imminent  of temple inland or its subsidiaries or in the event of a deadlock  as defined in the joint venture agreement 
the buy sell provisions are structured such that we are contemplated to be the purchaser in the event of any voluntary transfer of membership interest 
we generally consider our relationship with temple inland to be good with respect to our premier boxboard joint venture 
however  as described above  we could be required to fund premier boxboard s operations with additional cash contributions to the extent it is unable to fund operations with internally generated cash 
we cannot give assurance that material liquidity events will not arise with respect to our joint venture  and the occurrence of any such events could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest payment obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the long term debt obligation included in this table represents the principal amount to be paid in future periods

other long term liabilities exclude future pension liabilities  other postretirement benefit liabilities and deferred compensation benefit liabilities 

table of contents for the purposes of this table  purchase obligations included in the table above are agreements for purchase of goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on caraustar and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transactions 
however  this table does not include the aggregate amount of routine purchase orders outstanding as of december  operating cash flows 
cash used in operations was million for the year ended december   compared with cash provided by operations of million in the decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates of which million is attributable to the sale of our interest in the standard gypsum joint venture and a million reduction related to changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
these reductions  however  were partially offset by a million pension contribution made in september capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million for the year ended december   compared with million in the increase from prior years was primarily due to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning software system  the upgrade of a machine component at one of our paperboard mills  and the installation of a new printing press at one of our carton facilities 
aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million are anticipated for acquisition 
in december  we acquired a folding carton plant in charlotte  north carolina from the sonoco products company for million 
we believe that this acquisition is in line with our long term strategy and will provide value to our folding carton and custom packaging segment in the charlotte area 
divestitures 
in december  we completed the sale of our maryland based hunt valley corrugated operations to green bay packaging  inc for million 
this facility was sold since it was our only corrugated manufacturing plant and had incurred significant losses 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million loss on disposal which was recorded in the results of discontinued operations

the sale was completed in july we also entered into an agreement granting cascades inc an option to buy components of the coating equipment and the customer list of our rittman  ohio coated paperboard mill for thousand 
cascades inc exercised its option in august and  as a result  we ceased our coated recycled paperboard production at the rittman  ohio location  which resulted in a million charge for severance benefits during for the year ended december   we also recorded an additional million asset impairment as a result of this transaction 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded the sale of our specialty packaging division 
the division was sold to several buyers for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we recorded a loss of approximately million associated with this divestiture which was recorded as restructuring and impairment costs of discontinued operations 
approximately million of the loss was recorded in and million was recorded in dividends 
in february  we announced that we would suspend future dividend payments on our common stock until our earnings performance and cash flow improve 
our debt agreements contain certain limitations on the payment of dividends and currently preclude us from doing so 

table of contents inflation raw material and energy cost changes have had  and continue to have  a material negative effect on our operations 
we do not believe that general economic inflation is a significant determinant of our raw material and energy cost increases or that it has a material effect on our operations 
subsequent events on january   we announced the closure of our lafayette paperboard mill located in lafayette  indiana 
we expect to incur approximately million in costs associated with this closure 
of this amount  approximately million was recorded in and are non cash costs associated primarily with asset impairment charges 
the remaining million are cash costs consisting primarily of severance and other closure costs 
also on january   we announced the closures of four facilities in our tube  core  and composite container segment 
the facilities are located in amarillo  texas  vacaville  california  grand rapids  michigan and leyland  united kingdom 
we expect to incur approximately million in costs associated with these closures 
of this amount  approximately million will be non cash costs associated primarily with asset impairment charges 
the remaining million will be cash costs consisting primarily of severance and other employee related costs and costs associated with relocating equipment

 inventory costs sfas no 

sfas no 
amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
it states that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight costs  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that the allocation of overhead costs be based upon normal capacity for the production facilities and that any overhead costs not allocated due to lower production be recognized as current period charges and not capitalized in inventory 
we adopted sfas no

r  share based payment sfas r which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
sfas r supersedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
the approach in sfas r is generally similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the earnings statements based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosures are no longer an alternative 
we adopted sfas r as of january  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas  through december  we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally have not recognized compensation costs for employee stock options 
pretax compensation expense of approximately thousand was recorded in resulting from adoption of this standard 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows 
this provision of the standard did not impact operating cash flows in 
table of contents in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  financial statement classification  tax related interest and penalties  and additional disclosure requirements 
we are required to adopt this interpretation effective january  we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this interpretation on our financial statements 
any necessary transition adjustments will not affect net income in the period of adoption and will be reported as a change in accounting principle in the consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this interpretation and can not yet estimate the impact

sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab permits registrants to record the cumulative effect of initial adoption by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings only if material under the dual method 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  sab did not impact our financial statements

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied  with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the provisions of sfas no

   and r sfas no 

sfas no 
requires employers to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
sfas no 
requires prospective application  thus  the recognition and disclosure requirements are effective for our fiscal year ending december  see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report for the impact of adoption of sfas no

this pronouncement permits entities to use the fair value method to measure certain financial assets and liabilities by electing an irrevocable option to use the fair value method at specified election dates 
after election of the option  subsequent changes in fair value would result in the recognition of unrealized gains or losses as period costs during the period the change occurred 
sfas no 
becomes effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november   with early adoption permitted 
however  entities may not retroactively apply the provisions of sfas no
