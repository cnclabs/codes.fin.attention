strategic transactions a review and understanding of our historical growth during the past three fiscal years should consider the timing of our strategic transactions 
these transactions for our company and our predecessor companies are outlined below 
in addition to the impact of these transactions  we have had significant growth in our own brands and will continue to focus on developing those brands 
roaring water bay acquisition 
on december   in connection with our acquisition of the roaring water bay spirits group limited and the roaring water bay spirits company gb limited and their related entities  referred to collectively as roaring water bay  described above  we added the boru vodka  clontarf irish whiskey and brady s irish cream brands to our portfolio 
while we were already selling boru vodka in the united states pursuant to the distribution agreement  the acquisition added significant boru vodka sales internationally  principally in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom 
this acquisition is reflected in our financial results for the last four months of our fiscal year ended march  and in all subsequent periods 
pallini liqueur distribution agreement

sales of those products are reflected in our results for the fiscal year ended march   commencing as of august  and in all subsequent periods

this export agreement became effective on april  the financial results of gosling castle partners are included in our consolidated financial statements commencing as of our february purchase of such interest  with adjustments for minority interest  however  it had no mea ningful operations prior to the april  commencement of the export agreement 
mclain kyne acquisition 
on october   as a result of our acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of mclain kyne  ltd f k a mclain kyne distillery  ltd  we added mclain kyne s premium small batch bourbons to our portfolio jefferson s  jefferson s reserve and sam houston 
the financial results of this acquisition are included in our financial statements commencing october  and in all subsequent periods 
operations overview we generate revenue through the sale of our premium spirits to our network of wholesale distributors or  in control states  state owned agencies  which  in turn  distribute our premium brands to retail outlets 
a number of factors affect our overall level of sales  including the number of cases sold  revenue per case  relative contribution by brand and geographic mix 
changes in any of these factors may have a material impact on overall sales 
we introduced the new boru vodka bottle design in april in the us  and will introduce it in the international markets starting in september during fiscal we are launching an advertising campaign that will feature our new bottle design for boru vodka 
this represents a significant upgrade in packaging and brings the product more in line with its brand positioning 
in the united states  our sales price per case includes excise tax and import 
table of contents duties  which are also reflected in a corresponding increase in our cost of sales 
most of our international sales are sold in bond  with the excise taxes paid by our customers upon shipment  thereby resulting in lower relative revenue as well as a lower relative cost of sales  although some of our united kingdom sales are sold tax paid  as in the united states 
our sales typically peak during the months of october through december in anticipation of  and during  the holiday season 
see risk factors our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future rendering quarter to quarter comparisons unreliable as indicators of performance 
the difference between sales and net sales principally reflects adjustments for various distributor incentives 
our gross profit is determined by the prices at which we are able to sell our products  our ability to control our cost of sales  the relative mix of our case sales by brand and geography and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
our cost of sales is principally driven by our cost of procurement  bottling and packaging  which differ by brand  as well as freight and warehousing costs 
we purchase certain of our products  such as the gosling s rums and pallini liqueurs  as finished goods 
for other products  we purchase the components of our products  including the distilled spirits  bottles and packaging materials  and have arrangements with third parties for bottling and packaging 
our us sales typically have a higher absolute gross margin than in other markets  as sales prices per case are generally higher in the united states than elsewhere 
selling expense principally includes advertising and marketing expenditures and compensation paid to our marketing and sales personnel 
our selling expense  as a percentage of sales and per case  is currently high compared to our competitors because of our brand development  level of marketing spend and our established sales force versus our relatively small base of case sales and sales volumes 
however  we believe that our strategy of building an infrastructure capable of supporting our anticipated future growth is the correct long term approach for us 
in anticipation of continuing growth  we have added the following components that are included in selling costs

spacer

spacer 
gif 
hiring of a highly qualified and experienced sales force  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer

continuous improvement of our product distribution network and forging of strong distributor relationships beyond those a company of our size might be expected to maintain  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
implementation of a products depletion tracking system  by both brand and sku enabling us to more effectively target our selling efforts 
while we expect the absolute level of selling expense to continue to increase in the coming years  we also expect selling expense as a percentage of revenues and on a per case basis to continue to decline  as our volumes expand and we employ our direct sales team over a larger number of brands 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that support our operations 
these expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll  occupancy and related expenses and professional services 
while we expect these expenses to increase on an absolute basis as our sales volumes continue to increase and we add additional personnel  we also expect our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to continue to decline due to economies of scale 
we expect to significantly increase our case sales in the us and internationally over the next several years through organic growth  and through the extension of our product line via acquisitions and distribution agreements 
we will seek to maintain strong liquidity and manage our working capital and overall capital resources during this period of anticipated growth to be able to take advantage of these opportunities and to achieve our long term objectives  although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
we believe continued investment in marketing and advertising to broaden customer awareness and the hiring of salespeople to provide greater coverage of key geographic regions is important to the improvement of operations 
these efforts will lead to sizable increases in our absolute level of selling expense and it is uncertain as to whether the investment will translate into increased customer brand recognition for our spirits and therefore greater case sales 
given the competitive nature of the 
table of contents spirits industry and the existence of well established brands in each spirits category  we expect to incur increased competition from existing and new competitors as we achieve greater case sales and market share 
we believe a number of industry dynamics and trends will create growth opportunities for us to broaden our spirits portfolio and increase our case sales  including

the continued consolidation of brands among the major spirits companies is expected to result in their divestiture of non core brands  which may create an opportunity for us as we focus on smaller and emerging brands  
spacer

spacer

spacer

the ongoing industry consolidation is expected to make it more difficult for spirits companies and new entrants to secure an attractive route to market  particularly in the united states  while we already have established extensive us and international distribution

owners of small private and family owned spirits brands will seek to partner with or be acquired by a larger company with global distribution 
we expect to be an attractive alternative for these brand owners as one of the few modestly sized publicly traded spirits companies  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
particular opportunities in the premium end of the spirits market in which we participate  given positive changes in customer preferences  demographics and expected growth rates in the imported spirits segments 
our growth strategy is based upon acquiring smaller and emerging brands and growing existing brands 
to identify potential acquisition candidates we plan to rely on our management s industry experience and our extensive network of contacts in the industry 
we also plan to maintain and grow our us and international distribution channels so that we are more attractive to smaller spirits companies who are looking for a route to market for their products 
with respect to small private and family owned spirits brands  we will continue to be flexible and creative in our acquisition proposals and present an alternative to the larger spirits companies 
we also believe there will be growth opportunities for us as a result of the expected growth rates in the imported spirits segments in which we compete 
given the historical and projected growth rates for the imported spirits industry  and the imported vodka and imported rum segments in particular  we are expecting growth in case sales for all of our products  with the most significant increases in boru vodka and gosling s rum 
we plan to increase our marketing and advertising initiatives to take full advantage of this anticipated growth  including the launch of a consumer oriented boru advertising campaign which was initiated in the first quarter of the pursuit of acquisitions and other new business relationships will require significant management attention and time commitment 
there is uncertainty concerning our ability to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates  our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms and whether we will complete these types of transactions in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
to address the uncertainty regarding potential acquisition candidates  we plan to rely on  and continue to grow  our extensive network of industry contacts to help us identify and evaluate spirits products with growth potential 
we plan to rely on our management team s extensive experience in the spirits industry to successfully integrate any products we acquire and  when appropriate  hire additional personal 

table of contents financial performance overview the following table sets forth certain information regarding our case sales for the fiscal years ending march   and the data in the following table is based on nine liter equivalent cases  which is a standard spirits industry metric

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions discussed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations in that they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to our operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the product is shipped to a customer generally upon shipment to a distributor or to a control state entity  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale fob shipping point or fob destination and collection is reasonably assured 
we do not offer a right of return but will accept returns if we shipped the wrong product or wrong quantity 
accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value 
this value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts 
table of contents receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts 
we calculate this allowance based on our history of write offs  level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with  and economic status of  our customers 
inventory our inventory  which consists of distilled spirits  packaging and finished goods  is valued at the lower of cost or market  using the weighted average cost method 
we assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value 
we estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  historical usage  future demand and market requirements 
reduction to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
as of march  and goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets that arose from acquisitions were and million  respectively 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually  or  more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
in the first step the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
in the case that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting units and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting units 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
stock based awards effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  applying the modified prospective method 
prior to april   we accounted for stock options according to the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  and therefore no related compensation expense was recorded for awards granted with no intrinsic value 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost associated with stock options recognized in the year ended march  includes amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all stock option awards granted prior to april  over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and amortization related to all stock option awards granted on or subsequent to april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
a compensation charge is recorded when it is probable that performance or service conditions will be satisfied 
the probability of vesting is updated annually and compensation is adjusted via a cumulative catch up adjustment or prospectively depending upon the nature of the change 
under the modified prospective transition method  prior period results have not been restated 

table of contents stock based compensation for the year ended march  was million 
we used the black sholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted 
the assumptions used in valuing the options granted during the years ended march   and are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments 
we believe that there is no material difference between the fair value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the balance sheets due to the short term maturity of these instruments  or with respect to the debt  as compared to the current borrowing rates available to us 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our financial statements

fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period 
there was no material change in the selling prices of our existing products 
our increase in net sales reflects an increase in overall case sales  primarily from existing brands 
the weakening dollar vis vis the euro and the british pound also positively impacted our net sales as our international sales which are denominated in euros and british pounds translated to us dollars at a higher rate 
however  some of these net sales gains were offset by reduced net sales from direct imports into the us  whereby federal excise taxes are paid directly by the distributor  resulting in lower revenue per case 
in addition vodka case sales  which have a lower revenue per case than most of our other brands  were a larger percentage of overall case sales in the fiscal year ended march  than the comparable prior period  also resulting in a lower net sales growth 

table of contents our case sales  measured in nine liter case equivalents  increased  cases  or  to  cases versus the comparable prior period  resulting in our largest year of sales to date 
our us case sales as a percentage of total case sales increased to during the fiscal year ended march  from in the prior fiscal year 
this increase reflects the momentum of our portfolio in the us  particularly for boru vodka  gosling s rums and the pallini liqueurs 
the table below presents the increase or decrease  as applicable  in our case sales by product category for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
current period whiskey case sales include sales of bourbon products following our acquisition of mclain kyne on october  in fiscal  we elected to discontinue sales of a low margin irish cream  which resulted in a decrease in the sales of liqueurs 
a decrease in the liqueur sales in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year was offset by increases in case sales of our other brands  particularly boru vodka  which sales increased in the us and overall from the prior fiscal year  primarily attributable to the launch of the new packaging in the u 
s  resulting in increased sales orders to fill distributor inventories  and by sales of newly acquired premium single batch bourbon brands following our acquisition of mclain kyne on october

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period  while our gross margin decreased to during the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the absolute increase in gross profit reflected our increased level of sales 
the decrease in gross margin percentage reflects a shift in product mix and increased growth of some of the lower margin products  including shifts in both brands and sizes 
our margins are lower on vodka  which was a greater portion of overall case sales in the fiscal year ended march  than in the comparable prior period 
in addition  since the majority of our production is billed in euros  we were adversely affected by the weakening dollar vis vis the euro 
selling expense 
selling expense increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period 
this increase in selling expense was attributable to the expansion  growth and continued support of our brands and increased case sales  including increases in distributor incentives and sales support costs and increased expenses in connection with the gosling s rum advertising campaign 
in order to strengthen our sales and marketing team  we added new personnel  which resulted in an increase in consultancy and compensation expense 
we adopted sfas r  share based payment on april   which resulted in stock based compensation expense attributable to sales and marketing personnel of million in the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the foregoing  selling expense as a percentage of net sales increased to in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period 
this increase in general and administrative expense was in part attributable to the increased costs of being a public company 
these public company costs include increases in professional fees and public company directors and officers liability insurance of million  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
in addition to increased compensation for existing personnel  we hired several new employees  resulting in an increase in compensation expense of million 
we also adopted sfas r  share based payment on april   which resulted in stock based compensation expense 
table of contents attributable to personnel other than those in sales and marketing of million in the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the foregoing  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased to in the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the comparable prior year period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior year period 
this increase was primarily attributable to our acquisition of additional fixed and intangible assets and the accelerated amortization expense resulting from our termination of the comans distribution agreement  such termination to be effective in september other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior period 
the major components of this category include a change in foreign exchange  net interest income expense and minority interest 
foreign exchange gain during the fiscal year ended march  was million as compared to a loss of million in the comparable prior period 
the current period gain is attributable to the effects of the strengthening of the euro and the british pound against the dollar on our intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries 
interest income during the fiscal year ended march  was million as compared to zero in the comparable prior period 
the source of this income is the investment of the proceeds of our initial public offering in april interest expense during the fiscal year ended march  was million versus million in the comparable prior period 
the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the write off of deferred financing costs in connection with the conversion of of our convertible notes upon completion of our initial public offering in april of million  the vesting of certain warrants treated as interest expense of million  as well as the expansion of our senior notes to million from million in november  resulting in million of additional interest expense 
minority interest during the fiscal year ended march  amounted to a credit of million as compared to a credit of million in the comparable prior period as a result of a larger loss recorded by our owned subsidiary  gosling castle partners  inc net loss attributable to common stockholders 
the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million in the comparable prior period 
net loss per common share basic and diluted was positively affected by the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the shares issued and converted in our initial public offering 
as previously discussed  we adopted sfas r  share based payment on april   which resulted in total stock based compensation expense of million in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to none in the comparable prior period 
the net loss per common share included million of preferred stock dividends accrued during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million in the comparable prior pe riod 
ebitda 
ebitda decreased to negative million for the year ended march  versus negative million the comparable prior period 
ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense including expensing of deferred financing costs  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and the impact of the non cash charge for stock based compensation reported under sfas r 
we use ebitda as the primary internal management measure for evaluating performance on a period over period analysis  when comparing actual results to budgeted performance and when allocating additional resources 
this non gaap financial measure is presented in order to assist industry analysts and investors in assessing our liquidity  our ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance  as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity  or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
unlike net income  ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures 
table of contents or the cost of capital 
we compensate for these limitations by using ebitda as only one of several comparative tools  together with gaap measurements  to assist in the evaluation of operating performance 
such gaap measurements include operating income loss  net income loss  cash flows from operations and cash flow data 
we have significant uses of cash flows  including interest payments  debt principal repayments  and other non recurring charges  which are not reflected in ebitda 
because ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth our reconciliation of ebitda to net loss the most directly comparable financial measure

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million in the prior fiscal year  and our gross margin increased to during the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the absolute increase in gross profit reflected our increased level of sales and the increase in gross margin reflected higher 
table of contents margins attributable to gosling s rums and pallini liqueurs as well as to a shift in our product mix to products which are produced by others 
although gross margins are less on our vodka sales  the increase in case sales has offset the lower margin achieved 
selling expense 
selling expense increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the prior fiscal year 
the change in selling expense was primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation expense due to the hiring of additional sales personnel  including sales personnel hired by the new gosling castle partners global export venture in which the company has a interest  to an increase in distributor incentives and sales support costs of million and to increases in selling related shipping costs and sales commissions of million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expense decreased to compared to for the comparable prior year period 
this decrease is principally due to leveraging our sales force and marketing expenditures acro ss increased sales volumes 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million in the prior fiscal year 
major components of this increase included an increase of million in compensation expense due to the hiring of additional corporate personnel  including several accounting personnel and our president and chief operating officer  increased professional and recruiting fees of million  increased occupancy  insurance and other office expenses of million and an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts of million 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the comparable prior year period  due to economies of scale with higher sales volumes 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the comparable prior year period 
this increase was primarily attributable to amortization of the gosling worldwide except bermuda distribution agreement which became effective during february net loss attributable to common stockholders 
the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
these net losses included million and million in preferred stock dividends accrued during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our industry is subject to seasonality with peak sales in each major category generally occurring in the fourth calendar quarter  which is our third fiscal quarter 
see risk factors our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future rendering quarter to quarter comparisons unreliable as indicators of performance 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters concluding with the quarter ended march  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with our annual financial statements and related notes 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter

our quarterly results of operations include the results of operations of gosling castle partners  our owned strategic venture  commencing as of the february  closing date of our investment in such entity  with adjustments for minority interest  however  gosling castle partners had no meaningful operations prior to april  net loss per common share basic and diluted was positively affected by the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the shares issued and converted in our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash have been for selling and marketing expense  employee compensation  new product development and working capital 
our main sources of cash have been from the sale of common and preferred stock  the sale of convertible and senior notes and borrowings under bank credit facilities 
our balance of cash equivalents and short term investments was million at march  as compared to million at march  this increase is attributable to the receipt of net proceeds of approximately million upon our initial public offering in april our balance of cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million in may as a result of the 
table of contents closing of a million private placement of common stock and warrants sold to certain institutional investors 
the net proceeds of the private placement are million  after giving effect to the placement fee of million 
the following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to mid term

expansion into new markets and within existing markets in the united states and internationally 
we expect that we will require increasing amounts of working capital to finance our inventory levels in the united states 
except for gosling s rums  which are bottled in the united states  all of our products are imported from europe 
in the case of our wholly owned brands  there is a three to four month production and shipping lead time between the time of order placement and the time the product is available for sale 
this lead time has required us to ensure that we maintain sufficient inventories to properly service our customers 
we expect to experience a lengthening of the revenue collection cycle due to the need to extend payment terms as an incentive to encourage customers to make container sized purchases of our products on which title passes to the customer at the shipping point in ireland 
a lengthening of the revenue collection cycle will require a significant amount of working capital

operating activities

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation will apply to our fiscal year beginning april  we do not expect the interpretation will have a material impact on its results from operations or financial position 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin  considering the effects on prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  sab 
sab requires registrants to quantify errors using both the income statement method ie iron curtain method and the rollover method and requires adjustment if either method indicates a material error 
if a correction in the current year relating to prior year errors is material to the current year  then the prior year financial information needs to be corrected 
a correction to the prior year results that are not material to those years would not require a restatement process where prior financials would be amended 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  we determined that sab did n ot have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows

subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities would be recognized in earnings when they occur 
sfas further establishes certain additional disclosure requirements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier adoption permitted 
management is currently evaluating the impact and timing of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated financial statements

we do participate in certain foreign exchange currency future contracts programs to limit our risk and the potential impact of currency fluctuations on our product costs 
when placing a product order  we attempt to lock in its cost by buying forward contracts on euros coinciding with the projected payment dates for such purchases 
individual forward contracts rarely extend for more than six months or exceed

depending upon the term of the contract  the cost of these transactions can vary between approximately to basis points
