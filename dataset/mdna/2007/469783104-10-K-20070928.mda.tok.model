item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview jaco is a leading distributor of active and passive electronic components to industrial oems that are used in the manufacture and assembly of electronic products in such industries as telecommunications  medical devices  computers and office equipment  military aerospace and automotive and consumer electronics 
products distributed by the company include semiconductors  flat panel displays  capacitors  resistors  electromechanical devices and power supplies 
the electronics industry experienced a severe downturn beginning in  which continued through most of the decline was attributable to increased manufacturing capacity combined with a significant decrease in demand for electronic components 
during the second half of we saw an improvement in the demand for electronic components throughout the entire industry 
while demand for our products has remained relatively stable in recent periods  the average selling prices of many of the components we distribute  particularly semiconductor and passive components  have decreased due to global competitive pressures  which has adversely affected our operating profits 
in response  the company has implemented cost reduction initiatives to reduce expenses to levels required to support current sales and profit levels 
due to the ongoing shift of manufacturing to the far east  the company has modified its business model to pursue the business available in the united states  increase its support of global contract manufacturers that require its value added services and logistics programs  and aggressively promote its flat panel display fpd product offerings line  which has experienced significant growth in fiscal and which the company believes has potential for growth in the future 
net loss in fiscal was million  compared with a net loss of million during fiscal fiscal results were impacted by an income tax provision of million to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to zero as management was no longer able to conclude that  based upon the weight of available evidence  it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while for any given estimate or assumption made by our management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable  we believe that  given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements 
the accounting principles we utilized in preparing our consolidated financial statements conform in all material respects to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows valuation of receivables the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
the company continuously monitors payments from customers and a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts is maintained based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues  which have been identified 
while such uncollectible amounts have historically been within the company s expectations and provisions established  if a customer s financial condition were to deteriorate  additional reserves may be required 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally mitigated due to the large number of entities comprising the company s customer base  their dispersion across geographic areas and industries  along with the company s policy of maintaining credit insurance 
valuation of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out and average cost methods 
the company s inventories are comprised of high technology components sold to rapidly changing and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors rendering inventories as unsaleable at normal gross profit margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate market value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers governing price protections and stock rotations 
due to the large number of transactions and complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding the valuation of inventory at market value 
in addition  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual results may be different than those estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired companies allocated to goodwill 
other intangible assets primarily represent franchise agreements and non compete covenants 
we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results as the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant industry or economic trends 
when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and goodwill could occur 
valuation of deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we would record a valuation allowance when  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the amount of future tax benefit would not be realized 
while the company still believes that it is positioned for long term growth  the volatility in our industry and markets has made it increasingly difficult to predict sales and operating results on a short term basis  and when coupled with the cumulative losses reported over the last five fiscal years  the company was no longer able to conclude that  based upon the weight of available evidence  it was more likely than not that its previously recorded deferred tax asset of million would be realized  and therefore  in the fiscal year ended june   it recorded a provision for million income tax to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax asset to zero 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the shipment of finished products to our customers when title is transferred 
revenue is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
management considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we reduce revenue for rebates and estimated customer returns and other allowances 
we offer rebates to certain customers based on the volume of products purchased 
our products are sold on a stand alone basis and are not part of sales arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue from product sales is recognized when the product is shipped as we do not have any obligations beyond shipment to our customers 
when the shipping terms are fob shipping point  revenue is recorded as the goods leave our facility 
in certain instances and to certain customers  goods are shipped with shipping terms of fob destination point 
in these instances we determine when the goods are delivered to our customer s facility and calculate whether an adjustment to defer revenue recognition is required 
if such adjustment is material  an adjustment is recorded in the financial statements 
prior to fiscal such adjustments have not been material 
a portion of our business involves shipments directly from our suppliers to its customers 
in these transactions  we are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer  product returns  and have risk of loss if the customer does not make payment 
as the principal with the customer  we recognize revenue when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped 
we also maintain a consignment inventory program  which provides for certain components to be shipped on site to a consignee so that such components are available for the consignee s use when they are required 
the consignee maintains a right of return related to unused parts that are shipped under the consignment inventory program 
revenue is not recognized from products shipped on consignment until notification is received from our customer that they have accepted title of the inventory that was shipped initially on consignment 
the items shipped on consignment in which title has not been accepted are included in our inventories 
stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r on july   we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we apply the black scholes option pricing model  including an estimate of forfeitures 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option term  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option term assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
the adoption of sfas no 
r has had no impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flow 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board ratified a consensus opinion reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf issue  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the guidance in eitf issue requires disclosure in interim and annual financial statements of the amount of taxes on a gross basis  if significant  that are assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction between a seller and customer such as sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
additionally  the income statement presentation gross or net of such taxes is an accounting policy decision that must be disclosed 
the consensus in eitf issue is effective for the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the company adopted eitf issue effective in the fiscal year ended june  the adoption of eitf issue did not have a significant effect on its financial statements as it did not change its existing accounting policy which is to present taxes within the scope of eitf issue on a net basis 
in june  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition and threshold measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be takes on a tax return 
the company will be required to adopt the interpretation in the first quarter of fiscal management is currently evaluating the requirements of fin no 
and has not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in  september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
 to eliminate the diversity in practice that exists due to the different definitions of fair value 
sfas no 
retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value  but clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
sfas no 
states that the transaction is hypothetical at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the asset or liability 
as such  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price  as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability at the measurement date an entry price 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 

this standard amends sfas no  accounting for certain investment in debt and equity securities  with respect to accounting for a transfer to the trading category for all entities with available for sale and trading securities electing the fair value option 
this standard allows companies to elect fair value accounting for many financial instruments and other items that currently are not required to be accounted as such  allows different applications for electing the option for a single item or groups of items  and requires disclosures to facilitate comparisons of similar assets and liabilities that are accounted for differently in relation to the fair value option 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which is our fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our statement of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net loss comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal results from continuing operations net sales for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  an million  or increase 
we support global contract manufacturers primarily in the far east with logistic programs 
these programs consist of inventory management services and warehousing capabilities 
sales to these customers consist almost entirely of semiconductors 
during the earlier quarters of fiscal demand was very strong for this product 
during the last two quarters we have seen a weakening in demand 
net sales to these contract manufacturers were million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this represents an increase of million  or 
our global customers support the requirements of major equipment manufactures 
as a result  our logistics programs are partially dependent on the ability of these manufacturers to forecast future requirements 
a continuing weakened demand could result in lower net sales during fiscal the increase in sales through our logistics programs resulted in an increase in our sales of semiconductors 
semiconductor sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this represented an increase of million  or 
the increase in semiconductor sales was due to the strong demand for product through our logistic programs during the first two quarters of fiscal the weakened demand from our global contract manufacturer customers  as well as from other semiconductor customers  primarily in the united states  could negatively impact our semiconductor sales in future periods 
due to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  we have historically been subject to fluctuations in this portion of our business 
passive components  which are primarily commodity products such as capacitors  resistors and electromechanical components  which consist primarily of relays  printer heads  and power supplies  accounted for approximately million of sales in fiscal compared to approximately million of sales in fiscal this represents an increase of million or approximately 
we primarily sell passive components in the united states 
based on current demand for these components  we do not expect any material increases or decreases in our passive components sales for the foreseeable future 
we sell flat panel display fpd products as component sales through our standard distribution channel and also as a value added offering through our in house integration center 
we provide design capabilities and a full solution capability enabling us to offer our customers an expanded range of services 
we market our fpd capabilities to a broad range of business segments  such as electronic kiosk  the fast food industry  signage  financial institutions  electronic voting equipment  medical  and military applications 
fiscal sales for fpd product was million compared to million for fiscal the virtually flat sales when comparing this fiscal year to last fiscal year is the result of a significant customer in the electronic voting industry not placing any orders during the last six months of this fiscal year 
fpd sales to all other customers increased this fiscal year compared to last fiscal year 
based on our continued focus on this product  we believe we have potential for future growth 
we continue to aggressively market our fpd product  while looking to focus on our other products that we believe to be competitive in the united states 
we intend to continue to market our logistics programs to global manufacturers 
in addition  we continue to seek to identify potential strategic alliances to expand our presence in the far east in response to the significant growth in manufacturing in the region 
recently  we have opened a warehouse in singapore to better service our customers in the region 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal this represents a million increase in gross profit  or 
management considers gross profit to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
gross profit margins are usually a factor of product mix and demand 
we have been able to increase our gross profit margins by optimizing our procurement for the logistics programs and as a result slightly increasing the gross profit margins 
we have also been able to increase our fpd gross margin by approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal these two areas resulted in the overall increase in gross profit margin this fiscal year compared to last fiscal year 
any changes in demand for product could have a significant effect on our gross profit margin in the future 
in addition  demand and pricing for our products have been  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by industry wide trends and events beyond our control 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of net sales for fiscal compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal management considers sg a as a percentage of net sales to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
the increase in sg a when comparing this fiscal year to last fiscal year is primarily the result of variable costs  such as commissions  that are associated with the increase in gross profit dollars and additional costs that reflects our commitment to our fpd product 
we have increased staffing and increased our value added capabilities in this area during the current fiscal year 
operating income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this represents a million  or increase 
the increase in net sales and gross profit dollars generated the growth in operating profit 
interest expense increased million  or in fiscal to million from million in fiscal lower interest rates as a result of our new credit facility effective december  partially offset higher borrowing amounts that were required to support the increase in sales 
any changes in the federal or libor lending rates will impact our interest expense in the future 
earnings before taxes and discontinued operations was  for fiscal compared to a loss of  for fiscal this was primarily the result of increased sales and corresponding gross profit dollars 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal it was determined that the note receivable recorded from the sale of nexus custom electronics  inc during september has become uncollectible 
therefore  we deemed it appropriate to write off approximately million as discontinued operations 
as a result  the net loss for fiscal is million compared to a net loss of million for fiscal comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal net sales for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
net sales for the three months ended june  were million compared to million for the three months ended june   an increase of million  or 
we support contract manufacturers  primarily in the far east  with inventory management services 
sales to these contract manufacturers decreased during fiscal by million  or  to million from million in fiscal primarily due to lower demand from these customers during the first half of fiscal demand from these customers strengthened in the second half of fiscal and  as a result  net sales to contract manufacturers in the second half of fiscal were higher than in the same period of fiscal sales to contract manufacturers represented of our net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal our logistical programs  consisting of inventory management services and warehousing capabilities  through which we generate sales to our contract manufacturer customers  are comprised almost entirely of semiconductors 
semiconductors represented of our net sales during fiscal compared to in fiscal passive components  which are primarily commodity product such as capacitors and resistors  represented of our net sales during fiscal compared to in fiscal reflecting the continuation of a long term trend  passive component unit pricing continued to decline in fiscal  partially due to additional supply capacity  primarily originating from the far east 
electromechanical products  such as power supplies  relays  and printer heads  represented of our net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily through our logistic programs with contract manufacturers in the far east  our export sales represented approximately of our net sales in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal we sell flat panel displays fpds as a component sale through our standard distribution channel and we sell fpd product as a value added offering through our in house integration center  primarily to target markets where we believe we can be competitive  including such sectors as electronic voting machines  electronic kiosk  military and multimedia equipment 
we provide design capabilities and a full solution capability enabling us to offer our customers an expanded range of services to integrate fpds into their applications sales in fiscal increased to million compared to million for fiscal the growth is primarily attributable to increased sales through our integration center  which was fully operational for all of fiscal as compared to only five moths of fiscal after opening in february 
fpd product represented of our net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal management considers gross profit to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
gross profit margins are usually a factor of product mix and demand for product 
during fiscal  we took a write down for obsolete inventory of approximately million based on our determination that  due to changes in market conditions in the united states  certain product primarily intended for specific customers were no longer saleable 
excluding this write down  our gross profit margin for fiscal would have been 
the increase in our gross profit margin in fiscal is primarily due to the increase in sales of our higher margin fpd product  decrease in sales associated with our logistical programs with global contract manufacturers which usually operate at lower margins  and as a result of our focus on those core vendors whose products are higher margin and still have viable market in the united states 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  representing a reduction of million  or 
management considers sg a as a percentage of net sales to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
we implemented significant cost reductions by focusing our spending on core business areas while decreasing spending in non strategic areas 
this allowed us to lower sg a while maintaining the necessary infrastructure to support our customers 
interest expense increased million  or in fiscal to million from million in fiscal interest expense increased primarily due to increases in federal lending rates resulting in higher borrowing rates under out credit facility 
during fiscal  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million consisting mainly of a million deferred tax write off 
while the company believes that it is positioned for long term growth  as indicated by our profitability for each of the last two quarters of fiscal  the volatility in our industry and markets has made it increasingly difficult to predict sales and operating results on a short term basis and  when coupled with the cumulative losses reported over the last four fiscal years and the first two quarters of fiscal  the company was no longer able to conclude that  based on the weight of available evidence  it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset of million would be realized 
net loss from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our net income from continuing operations was  or per diluted share 
our net income for the fourth quarter and reduced net loss for fiscal is due to our increase in gross profit dollars and reduction in sg a expenses 
net loss in fiscal was almost entirely attributable to our write off of million in deferred tax assets during the fiscal year for the reasons described above and in note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources to provide liquidity in funding its operations  the company borrows amounts under credit facilities and other external sources of financing 
on december   the company entered into a new three year credit agreement with cit group business credit  inc  which provides for a  revolving secured line of credit 
this credit facility has a maturity date of december  on january   the cit group business  inc assigned  of its interest in the credit facility to bank of america  na on march   the credit facility was amended to provide the company with a supplemental loan of  which was payable on may  the supplemental loan 
on may  the supplemental loan was amended 
the amendment provided for periodic payments to be made through july   at which time the supplemental loan was paid in full 
on july  the supplemental loan was amended again 
the amendment provides a  loan at an interest rate equal to the libor rate plus 
the loan is payable in seven quarterly installments commencing october  in addition  mandatory prepayments are to be made based i on an amount equal to fifty percent of excess cash flow  as defined in the agreement and ii on the net proceeds of designated inventory  as defined in the agreement 
borrowings under the credit facility are based principally on eligible accounts receivable and inventories of the company  as defined in the credit agreement  and are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
at june   the outstanding balance on this revolving line of credit facility was   of which is borrowed under a day libor based revolver and  under the supplemental loan with an additional  available 
at june   the company had outstanding  of stand by letters of credit on behalf of certain vendors 
the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at june  was on the borrowings under the day libor based revolver  on the supplemental loan and prime plus on the balance of the borrowings 
at march   the company had outstanding million of stand by letters of credit on behalf of certain vendors 
the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at march  was on the borrowings under the day libor based revolver  on the supplemental loan and prime plus on the balance of the borrowings 
under the credit agreement  the company is required to comply with one financial covenant which stipulates that in the event the company s additional borrowing availability under the revolving line of credit facility for any five consecutive days is less than  the company is required to retroactively maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined therein of to as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters 
the credit agreement also provides for a limitation on capital expenditures of  for the company s fiscal year and  for remaining fiscal years in which the credit agreement is in effect 
the credit agreement also contains other covenants and restrictions  including limitations on the company s incurrence of additional indebtedness unrelated to the credit facility  its incurrence of liens  mergers  consolidations and sales of assets by the company  investments  loans and acquisitions by the company  and the company s ability to pay cash dividends 
in addition  the credit agreement includes a subjective acceleration clause and requires the deposit of customer receipts to be directed to a blocked account and applied directly to the repayment of indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility 
accordingly  outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement are classified as a current liability 
as of june   the company was in compliance with all of its covenants contained in the credit agreement 
at june   the company had cash of approximately  and working capital of approximately  as compared to cash of approximately  and working capital of approximately  at june  as described above  our credit agreement requires our cash generated from operations to be applied directly to the prepayment of indebtedness under our credit facility 
for fiscal our net cash used in operating activities was approximately  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of  million for fiscal the increase in net cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in our current liabilities  primarily accounts payable  offset by a smaller decrease in inventory for fiscal as compared to an increase in our accounts receivable and accounts payable for fiscal in addition we had income from continuing operations before taxes of  for fiscal as compared to a loss from continuing operations before taxes of  for fiscal net cash used in investing activities was approximately  for fiscal as compared to net cash used in investing activities of  for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal the increase in net cash provided is attributable to an increase in net borrowings under our new credit facility 
for fiscal and  our inventory turnover was times and times  respectively 
the average days outstanding of our accounts receivable at june  were days  as compared to days at june  inventory turnover and average days outstanding are key ratios that management relies on to monitor our business 
based upon our present plans  including no anticipated material capital expenditures  we believe that cash flow that we expect to generate from operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for the next twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends partially on our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue  while continuing to control costs  and remaining in compliance with our bank covenants 
historically  including on several occasions during the fiscal year ended june   we have  when necessary  been able to obtain amendments to our credit facilities or waivers from our lenders to satisfy instances of our non compliance with financial covenants 
while we cannot assure that any such future amendments or waivers  if needed  will be available  management believes we will be able to continue to obtain financing on acceptable terms under our existing credit facility or through other external sources 
in the event that in the future we are unable to obtain such an amendment or waiver of our non compliance with our financial covenants  the lenders under our credit facility could declare us to be in default under the facility  requiring all amounts outstanding under the facility to be immediately due and payable and or limit the company s ability to borrow additional amounts under the facility 
if we did not have sufficient available cash to pay all such amounts that become due and payable  we would have to seek additional debt or equity financing through other external sources  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to maintain financing arrangements on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt  nor do we have any transactions  arrangements or relationships with any special purpose entities 
contractual obligations this table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june  total year to years to years years line of credit capital lease operating lease total inflation and seasonality inflation and seasonality have not had a significant impact on our operations during the last three fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes with respect to borrowings under our credit facility  which bears interest at a variable rate dependent upon either the prime rate  federal funds rate or the libor rate rates 
at august   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
changes in any of the rates during the current fiscal year will have a positive or negative effect on our interest expense 
each fluctuation in the rate will increase or decrease our interest expense under the credit facility by approximately million based on outstanding borrowings at august the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our other floating rate debt is not material
