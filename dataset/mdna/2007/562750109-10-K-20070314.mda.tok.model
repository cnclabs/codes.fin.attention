business overview we are a leading developer and provider of technology based supply chain software solutions that help companies manage the effectiveness and efficiency of their supply chain 
our business is organized into three geographical reporting segments americas north america and latin america  emea europe  middle east and africa  and apac asia pacific 
each of these reporting segments have unique characteristics and faces different challenges and opportunities 
in each of these segments  we provide solutions that consist of a combination of software  services  and hardware used for planning and execution of supply chain activities 
these solutions help coordinate the actions and communication of manufacturers  suppliers  distributors  retailers  transportation providers and consumers 
our solutions consist of two main areas supply chain planning and supply chain execution  which on a combined basis represent our supply chain management solution 
we call the combination of our supply chain planning solutions integrated planning solutions 
integrated planning solutions consist of advanced planning  demand forecasting and replenishment 
with our advanced planning solutions  financial and item planning  catalog planning  web planning and promotion planning  companies can plan their inventory using several methodologies 
financial and item planning enables companies to develop top down and bottom up plans across multiple channels and multiple levels of the product hierarchy 
catalog planning and web planning support the unique planning requirements of the catalog and web channels 
with promotion planning  companies are able to plan and manage promotional events and assortments 
demand forecasting enables companies to generate and maintain forecasts at different levels of product data 
it also includes a promotion forecasting solution which generates a promotion forecast and promotional lift based on historical sales 
finally  replenishment helps companies regulate  maintain and deploy inventory  as well as supports vendor managed inventory  which allows suppliers to manage their own replenishment 
we refer to the combination of our supply chain execution solutions as integrated logistics solution 
integrated logistics solutions consist of distributed order management  warehouse management  slotting optimization  labor management  yard management  transportation management systems tms  trading partner management tpm  reverse logistics management and rfid solutions 
distributed order management manages the order fulfillment process  capturing and allocating orders across the supply chain to balance supply with demand 
warehouse management manages the processes that take place in a distribution center  beginning with the placement of an order by a customer and ending with order fulfillment 
slotting optimization determines the optimal layout of a facility 
labor management enables the tracking  monitoring and management of employee activities within the warehouse 
transportation management allows companies to optimally plan and execute transportation services 
yard management plans  executes  tracks and audits all incoming and outgoing loads  managing both the yard and dock door 
trading partner management synchronizes the business processes and 
table of contents communication of suppliers  manufacturers  distributors  logistics service providers and customers 
reverse logistics management manages and automates the returns process tracking  storing  referencing and reporting on returned merchandise to increase net asset recovery 
our rfid solutions help capture and track epc data and utilize this information to better manage and track inventory 
for all of our solutions  we offer services such as design  configuration  implementation  product assessment and training plus customer support and software enhancement subscriptions 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we believe that estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions were made 
to the extent there are material differences between those estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions which we have identified as our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  stock based compensation  and business combinations 
revenue recognition our revenue consists of revenues from the licensing and hosting of software  fees from implementation and training services collectively  professional services  plus customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions  and sales of hardware and other other consists of reimbursements of out of pocket expenses incurred by professional services 
we recognize license revenue under statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  specifically when the following criteria are met a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method when there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for using long term contract accounting  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  and all revenue recognition criteria in sop  other than the requirement for vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each delivered element of the arrangement are satisfied 
for those contracts that contain significant customization or modifications  license revenue is recognized using contract accounting 
the accounting related to license revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules which are subject to change 
our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline  or if the financial condition of our customers deteriorate  we may be unable to determine that collectibility is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments 
our services revenue consists of fees generated from professional services  customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions related to our software products 
fees from professional services performed by us are generally billed on an hourly basis  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
professional services are sometimes rendered under agreements in which billings are limited to contractual maximums or based 
table of contents upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement 
revenue related to fixed fee based contracts is recognized on a proportional performance basis based on the hours incurred on discreet projects within an overall services arrangement 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which they become known 
revenue related to customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions are generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  typically months 
hardware and other revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products  developed and manufactured by third parties that are integrated with and complementary to our software solutions and reimbursement of out of pocket expenses incurred by professional services 
as part of a complete solution  our customers periodically purchase hardware from us in conjunction with the licensing of software 
these products include computer hardware  radio frequency terminal networks  radio frequency identification rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners and other peripherals 
hardware revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer when title passes 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer 
as a result  we do not maintain significant hardware inventory 
in accordance with the financial accounting standard board s fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  we recognize amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenue 
such amounts have been classified to hardware and other revenue 
the total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to revenue was million  million and million and for   and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credits based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts generally represent a sales allowance on services revenue  which are recorded to operations as a reduction to services revenue 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
our goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test  which requires us to estimate the fair value of our business compared to the carrying value 
the impairment reviews require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance 
should such review indicate the assets are impaired  we would record an expense for the impaired assets 
annual tests or other future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill is impaired 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believed was impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december   our goodwill balance was million 
accounting for income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return 
management must make significant assumptions  judgments and 
table of contents estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  allowable deductions  projected tax credits and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for our employee stock option plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
no stock based employee compensation cost related to stock options was recognized in the statements of income for periods prior to january   as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r for stock based compensation 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  our income before income taxes and net income for was million and million lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
basic and diluted earnings per share were each lower than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
we estimate the fair value of options granted on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
we base our estimate of fair value on certain assumptions  including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option  the expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term  and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option 
we base our expected volatilities on a combination of the historical volatility of our stock and the implied volatility of our publicly traded stock options 
due to the limited trading volume of our publicly traded options  we place a greater emphasis on historical volatility 
we also use historical data to estimate the term that options are expected to be outstanding and the forfeiture rate of options granted 
we base the risk free interest rate on the rate for us treasury zero coupon issues with a term approximating the expected term 
we recognize compensation cost for awards with graded vesting using the straight line attribution method  with the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that is vested at that date 
compensation cost recognized in any period is impacted by the number of stock options granted and the vesting period which generally is four years  as well as the underlying assumptions used in estimating the fair value on the date of grant 
this estimate is dependent upon a number of variables such as the number of options awarded  cancelled or exercised and fluctuations in our share price during the year 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts and acquired developed technologies  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will 
table of contents continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with purchase price allocations  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed in connection with acquisitions 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts  when and if available upgrades  or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
the sum of the costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
recent developments adoption of sfas no 
r 
prior to january   we accounted for our employee stock option plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
no stock based employee compensation cost related to stock options was recognized in the statements of income for periods prior to january   as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized on or after january  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for all prior periods have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires that cash flows resulting from the tax benefits generated by tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on january   our income before income taxes and net income for was million and million lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
basic and diluted earnings per share were each lower than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
the fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on certain assumptions  including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option  the expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term  and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option 
effective january   expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility of our publicly traded stock options 
due to the limited trading volume of our publicly traded options  we place a greater emphasis on historical volatility 
previously  we had relied exclusively on historical volatility  disregarding periods of time in which our share price was extraordinarily volatile because of company specific circumstances that were not expected to recur 
we also use historical data to estimate the term that options are expected to be outstanding and the forfeiture rate of options granted 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury zero coupon issues with a term approximating the expected term 
the weighted average grant date fair values of options granted during   and were   and  respectively 
we recognize compensation cost for awards with graded vesting using the straight line attribution method  with the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that is vested at that date 
at december   the unamortized compensation cost related to stock option awards totaled million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  the board of directors approved an option acceleration agreement that accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options held by our employees with an exercise price of or higher 
the accelerated vesting affected options for approximately option holders  representing million shares of our common stock 
in order to prevent unintended personal benefits to individuals resulting from the accelerated vesting of options  we imposed sales restrictions on shares acquired upon exercise of these options that parallel the vesting requirements of the original options 
these sales restrictions on the shares acquired continue following termination of employment until the original vesting dates are reached 
the accelerated vesting of these stock options with exercise prices greater than the then current market value underwater was made primarily to avoid recognizing compensation expense in our future income statements upon the adoption of sfas no 
r for underwater options that we believed would not offer a sufficient incentive to our employees when compared to the future compensation expense that we would have incurred under sfas no 
r 
compensation cost recognized in any period is impacted by the number of stock options granted and the vesting period which generally is four years  as well as the underlying assumptions used in estimating the fair value on the date of grant 
this estimate is dependent upon a number of variables such as the number of options awarded  cancelled or exercised and fluctuations in our share price during the year 
acquisition 
on august   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of evant  and evant became a wholly owned subsidiary 
evant is a provider of demand planning and forecasting and replenishment solutions to customers in the retail  manufacturing and distribution industries

table of contents we manage our business based on three geographic regions the americas  emea  and asia pacific 
geographic revenue information is based on the location of sale 
during  and  we derived the majority of our revenues from sales to customers within our americas region

revenue our revenue consists of fees generated from the licensing and hosting of software  fees from professional services  customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions  and sales of complementary radio frequency and computer equipment 
we believe our revenue growth in the last two years is attributable to several factors  including  among others  our market leadership position as to breadth of product offerings  financial stability and a compelling return on investment proposition for our customers  increased services associated with implementations of our expanded product suite  geographic expansion  and the acquisition of evant which provided us with a supply chain planning solution 
license revenue 
license revenue increased in over driven by strong growth in our americas segment 
the americas license and hosting revenues increased million  or  in over this increase was partially offset by declines in emea license sales of million  or 
asia pacific license revenue increased million  or 
a number of factors impacted revenue growth in our international segments 
table of contents including continued weakness in the general european economy and particularly in the capital spending environment for large information technology projects 
license sales mix across our product suite remained strong with approximately of sales in our warehouse management solutions and in non warehouse management solutions in with our expanded suite of supply chain solutions we continued to see solid growth in both our core warehouse management solutions with growth in and non warehouse management solutions with growth in over from period to period  we continue to see an increase in the diversity of products purchased from us by new and existing customers as our newer products gain greater market acceptance 
this diversification is contributing to the fluctuations in the sales mix of our solutions groups

these increases were partially offset by declines in emea of million  or due to delayed commitments for capital investments in supply chain solutions and overall weakness of the european economy 
our core warehouse management solutions grew in and our non warehouse management solutions grew in over services revenue 
services revenue increased in over principally due to a increase of professional services revenue required to implement larger projects  increased license sales and existing customer upgrades to more current versions of our offerings and a increase in revenue from software enhancement subscription agreements 
the americas segment led the growth with an increase in services revenue of million  or  from to services revenue in asia pacific also increased by million  or  from to these increases were offset by a decrease in emea services revenue of million  or  from to due to the lack of large license deals closed in the first three quarters of as the spending environment continues to be weak in emea 
services revenue increased in over principally due to a increase of professional services revenue and a increase in software enhancement subscription agreements 
a portion of the increase is attributable to the acquisition of evant which generated an incremental million of additional services revenue over the americas segment experienced services revenue growth of million  or  from to revenues for the asia pacific segment also increased by million  or  due to increased revenues in australia from a large retail customer and additional investments in australia  china  and japan 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million  or  in the emea segment due to the termination of our business relationship with a large customer in germany and the weak spending environment which has put downward pressure on our license and services revenues in the region 
over the past several years  we have experienced some pricing pressures with regard to our services 
we believe that the pricing pressures are attributable to global macro economic conditions and competitive pressures 
our services revenue growth has been and will likely continue to be affected by the mix of products sold 
the individual engagements involving our non warehouse management solutions typically require less implementation services  however  the number of engagements continues to grow 
hardware and other 
sales of hardware increased million  or in over sales of hardware decreased million  or in compared to over of this revenue is generated from the americas segment
