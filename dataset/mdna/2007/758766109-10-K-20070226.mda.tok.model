item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows of regal entertainment group for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of regal and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview and basis of presentation we conduct our operations primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the united states  consisting of  screens in theatres in states and the district of columbia as of december  we believe the size  reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations 
the company manages its business under one reportable segment theatre exhibition operations 
we also maintain an investment in national cinemedia  which has primarily concentrated its efforts on in theatre advertising  business meetings and non feature film content distribution 
we generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales 
additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs and electronic video games located adjacent to the lobbies of certain of our theatres 
in addition  national cinemedia provides us with revenues from its sale of on screen advertising  rental of theatres for business meetings and concerts and other events 
film rental costs depend on a variety of factors including the prospects of a film and the popularity of a film and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase 
because we purchase certain concession items  such as fountain drinks and popcorn  in bulk and not pre packaged for individual servings  we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts 
other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs

results of operations the fiscal year was a solid year for the industry and the company 
based on our review of industry sources  national box office revenues were estimated to have increased by approximately during fiscal year in comparison to fiscal year the industry achieved these results with strong attendance from the breadth of the fiscal film slate  coupled with ticket price increases 
our total revenue for the year ended december  fiscal period was  million  consisting of  million of admissions revenues  million from concessions revenues and million of other operating revenues  and represented a increase over total revenues of  million for the year ended december  fiscal period 
our fiscal period admissions revenues were favorably impacted by a increase in attendance  coupled with a increase in average ticket prices 
the increase in the fiscal period attendance was primarily attributable to a strong box office led by the overall breadth of the fiscal period film slate 
our fiscal period attendance also benefited by approximately new screens added since the end of the fiscal period and the screens acquired from amc during the fiscal period  partially offset by the closure of approximately underperforming screens subsequent to the end of the fiscal period 
in addition  the fiscal period attendance was favorably impacted by a full twelve months of results of operations from the screens acquired from r c theatres and eastern federal corporation during the fiscal period 
the increase in the fiscal period average ticket price was primarily attributable to periodic pricing reviews conducted by the company  which includes analysis of various factors  including general inflationary trends and local market conditions 
based on our review of certain industry sources  the increase in our admissions revenues was in line with the industry s results for the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period 
in addition  during the fiscal period  we experienced growth in average concession revenues per patron and a slight decline in other operating revenues 
the growth in average concession revenues per patron was primarily attributable to the success of certain family oriented and concession friendly films such as pirates of the caribbean dead man s chest  x men and cars exhibited during the fiscal period and periodic pricing reviews 
the decrease in other operating revenues in the fiscal period was primarily attributable to the revenues generated from national cinemedia being less than generated in the fiscal period due to the payment arrangement described in further detail under note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
such decreases were partially offset by increased revenues related to our vendor marketing programs and incremental other theatre revenues 
income from operations increased to million for the fiscal period compared to million in the fiscal period 
the net increase in income from operations during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to incremental admissions and concessions revenues described above  partially offset by lower other operating revenues and increases in certain operating expense items described in further detail below 
net income decreased to million in the fiscal period compared to net income of million in the fiscal period 
earnings per diluted share also decreased to for the fiscal period compared to during the fiscal period 
ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization was million for the fiscal period  a decrease of from million in the fiscal period and represented an ebitda margin of 
the decrease in net income  earnings per diluted share and ebitda are primarily due to the loss on debt extinguishment recorded in the fiscal period in connection with conversions of a portion of the company s convertible senior notes see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion coupled with decreases in other operating revenues and increases in certain expense items described in further detail below  partially offset by incremental admissions and concessions revenues due to the growth in attendance and increases in average ticket prices and average concessions per patron 
a tabular reconciliation of net income to ebitda and net cash provided by operating activities is provided below under results of operations ebitda 
during the fiscal period  we continued to make progress with respect to the following strategic initiatives we demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders 
total cash dividends distributed to our stockholders during the fiscal period totaled approximately million 
during september  the company acquired four theatres with a total of screens from amc 
regal purchased two of these amc theatres representing screens for approximately million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments  and acquired the other two amc theatres representing screens in exchange for two regal theatres consisting of screens 
in addition to the theatres acquired from amc  we opened new theatres with screens and closed theatres with screens including the two theatres exchanged with amc  ending the fiscal period with theaters and  screens 
on february   ncm inc  a newly formed entity that serves as the sole manager of national cinemedia  completed the initial public offering  or ipo  of its common stock 
ncm inc sold million shares of its common stock for per share in the ipo  less underwriting discounts and expenses 
because ncm inc s certificate of incorporation requires that ncm inc at all times maintain a one to one ratio between the number of common units of national cinemedia owned by ncm inc and the number of outstanding shares of common stock of ncm inc  ncm inc 
used a portion of the net proceeds from the ipo to acquire newly issued common units from national cinemedia 
in addition  national cinemedia paid the net proceeds to each of regal  amc and cinemark in exchange for modifying payment obligations for access to their respective theatres  for which regal received a payment of million 
upon the closing of the ipo  national cinemedia entered into a million term loan facility  the net proceeds of which were used to redeem preferred units issued to each of regal  amc and cinemark on a pro rata basis pursuant to a recapitalization of national cinemedia prior to completion of the ipo 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  we received million as a result of the preferred unit redemption 
at the closing of the ipo  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option to purchase an additional million shares of common stock of ncm inc at the initial offering price of per share  less underwriting discounts and commissions 
in connection with this over allotment option exercise  regal  amc and cinemark each sold to ncm inc common units of national cinemedia on a pro rata basis at the initial offering price of per share  less underwriting discounts and expenses 
regal sold  common units to ncm inc for proceeds of million  and upon completion of this sale of common units  regal held  common units of national cinemedia  or a interest 
after the payment of current taxes  we estimate net proceeds from these transactions to total approximately million

see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion of this joint venture arrangement 
we are optimistic regarding the film slate and share the view of a number of film studio executives and analysts who believe the industry is poised to benefit from a year of solid box office performance 
evidenced by the film studios continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases  appears to be another year of high profile releases such as spider man  shrek the third  pirates of the caribbean at world s end  ocean s thirteen  ratatouille  harry potter and the order of the phoenix  the bourne ultimatum and rush hour we intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions 
with respect to capital expenditures  due in part to the timing of certain construction projects  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million for fiscal  consisting of new theatre development  expansion of existing theatre facilities  upgrades and replacements 
overall for the fiscal year  we are forecasting a modest increase in attendance as a result of the upcoming high profile film releases described above and modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron 
in addition  we expect fiscal admission and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations 
we will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities  selective upgrades and providing incremental returns to our stockholders

we believe ebitda provides a useful measure of liquidity and financial performance for our investors because ebitda is an industry comparative measure of liquidity and financial performance prior to the payment of interest and taxes and because it is a primary financial measure used by management to assess our performance and liquidity 
ebitda is not a measurement of liquidity or financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered in isolation or construed as a substitute for net income or other operations data or cash flow data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for purposes of analyzing our profitability or liquidity 
in addition  not all funds depicted by ebitda are available for management s discretionary use 
for example  a substantial portion of such funds are subject to contractual restrictions and functional requirements for debt service  fund necessary capital expenditures and to meet other commitments from time to time as described in more detail in this form k 
ebitda  as calculated  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows in millions fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period net income interest expense  net provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda interest expense  net provision for income taxes deferred income taxes changes in operating assets and liabilities loss on debt extinguishment other items  net net cash provided by operating activities cash flows the following table summarizes certain cash flow data for the fiscal period  fiscal and fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents fiscal period compared to fiscal period net cash flows generated from operating activities were approximately million for the fiscal period  which represents a decrease of million compared to million in the fiscal period 
fiscal period net cash flows generated from operating activities were impacted by several factors including an increase in total revenues due primarily to increases in attendance coupled with increases in average ticket prices and average concessions per patron  offset by increases in certain expense items 
an approximate million increase in adjustments primarily losses on extinguishment of debt  equity in earnings of joint venture including former employee compensation  share based compensation and a greater loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities  offset by a million decrease in net income and a million reduction of changes in operating assets and liabilities  contributed to the net decrease in net cash provided by operating activities 
the net decrease in the changes in operating assets and liabilities and other working capital items was primarily related to the timing of income tax payments and to a lesser extent  the timing of certain vendor payments and a reclassification of excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements to cash flows used in financing activities discussed further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
net cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in investing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
contributing to the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was the purchase of eastern federal corporation theatres and r c theatres during the fiscal period  a million decrease in capital expenditures during the fiscal period  which was primarily attributable to the timing of capital projects during the fiscal period  partially offset by the acquisition of the amc theatres described more fully in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k and by lower proceeds from the disposition of assets effected during the fiscal period as compared the fiscal period 
net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in financing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
the net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to incremental borrowings under the senior credit facility and the reclassification of excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements from cash flows from operating activities discussed further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  partially offset by net cash used to settle conversions of approximately million in principal amount of the company s convertible senior notes and the payment of debt acquisition costs 
fiscal period compared to fiscal period cash flows generated from operating activities were approximately million for the fiscal period  which remained relatively consistent compared to million in the fiscal period 
fiscal period cash flows generated from operating activities were impacted by several factors including a decrease in income from operations during the fiscal period related to increases in certain operating expense items  partially offset by incremental admission  concession and other operating revenues and the inclusion of the results of operations of theatres purchased from signature theatres  r c theatres and eastern federal corporation 
an approximate million reduction in adjustments primarily loss on extinguishment of debt  partially offset by incremental depreciation and amortization expense and a loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by a million increase in net income and a million increase in the changes in operating assets and liabilities further contributed to the million net decrease in net cash provided by operating activities 
the net increase in the changes in operating assets and liabilities  and other working capital items was primarily related to the timing of certain vendor payments and income tax payments  increases in deferred revenues and trade and other receivables  partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in investing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
contributing to the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was a decline in cash used for acquisitions  partially offset by a million increase in capital expenditures during the fiscal period  which was primarily attributable to the timing of certain capital projects during the fiscal period 
in addition  we had greater proceeds from the disposition of assets during the fiscal period as compared the fiscal period 
cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in financing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
the net increase in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to increases in the fiscal period quarterly dividend payments compared to the per share fiscal period dividend payments and the fiscal period million aggregate purchase of treasury shares 
liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis  we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses  capital expenditures  general corporate purposes related to corporate operations  debt service  share repurchases and the company s quarterly dividend payments 
the principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  cash on hand and borrowings under our senior credit facility described below 
under the terms of the senior credit facility  regal cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to regal  its indirect parent 
since regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than its subsidiaries  this restriction could impact regal s ability to effect future debt or dividend payments  pay corporate expenses or redeem or convert for cash its convertible senior notes 
our revenues are generally collected in cash through admissions and concessions revenues 
our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs  rent and occupancy  and payroll 
film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the company s concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately days from purchase 
our current liabilities generally include items that will become due within twelve months and  as a result  at any given time  our balance sheet is likely to reflect a working capital deficit 
we fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows  cash on hand  proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities 
our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres  new theatre construction  adding new screens to existing theatres  upgrading the company s theatre facilities and replacing equipment 
we intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities 
the company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects  with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the company s internal rate of return targets 
we currently expect capital expenditures for theatre development  replacement  expansion  upgrading and replacements to be in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal year  exclusive of acquisitions 
such capital expenditures are expected to be partially funded through asset dispositions conducted during the normal course of our business 
during the fiscal period  we invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
on september   the company acquired four theatres with a total of screens from amc 
regal purchased two of these amc theatres representing screens for approximately million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments  and acquired the other two amc theatres representing screens in exchange for two regal theatres consisting of screens 
as of the acquisition date  the surrendered regal theatres had a net book value of approximately million 
the company accounted for the exchanged theatre assets as a non monetary transaction and as such  allocated the net book value of the regal theatres to the exchanged amc theatres 
total cash paid of approximately million was directly allocated to the two amc theatres using the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations of the four theatres have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the acquisition date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion of this transaction 
as described in note to the accompanying financial statements included in this part ii  item of this form k  in connection with the formation of national cinemedia  on may   rci adopted and approved a severance plan the severance plan for rcm employees who held an unvested option to purchase shares of regal s class a common stock or shares of regal s restricted class a common stock pursuant to the terms of the regal stock incentive plan immediately prior to such employee s termination of employment with rcm and commencement of employment with national cinemedia 
during the fiscal period  the company recorded total severance expense of approximately million  including less than million of payments in lieu of dividends  related to the severance plan 
on february   ncm inc  a newly formed entity that serves as the sole manager of national cinemedia  completed the initial public offering  or ipo  of its common stock 
ncm inc sold million shares of its common stock for per share in the ipo  less underwriting discounts and expenses 
because ncm inc s certificate of incorporation requires that ncm inc at all times maintain a one to one ratio between the number of common units of national cinemedia owned by ncm inc and the number of outstanding shares of common stock of ncm inc  ncm inc 
used a portion of the net proceeds from the ipo to acquire newly issued common units from national cinemedia 
in addition  national cinemedia paid the net proceeds to each of regal  amc and cinemark in exchange for modifying payment obligations for access to their respective theatres  for which regal received a payment of million 
upon the closing of the ipo  national cinemedia entered into a million term loan facility  the net proceeds of which were used to redeem preferred units issued to each of regal  amc and cinemark on a pro rata basis pursuant to a recapitalization of national cinemedia prior to completion of the ipo 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  we received million as a result of the preferred unit redemption 
at the closing of the ipo  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option to purchase an additional million shares of common stock of ncm inc at the initial offering price of per share  less underwriting discounts and commissions 
in connection with this over allotment option exercise  regal  amc and cinemark each sold to ncm inc common units of national cinemedia on a pro rata basis at the initial offering price of per share  less underwriting discounts and expenses 
regal sold  common units to ncm inc for proceeds of million  and upon completion of this sale of common units  regal held  common units of national cinemedia  or a interest 
after the payment of current taxes  we estimate net proceeds from these transactions to total approximately million 
we are currently exploring alternatives for using these proceeds  and may use some or all of the proceeds for strategic acquisitions or to return value to stockholders through an extraordinary dividend  stock repurchases or other corporate uses 
in connection with the completion of the ipo  regal amended and restated its existing services agreement with national cinemedia  whereby in exchange for its pro rata share of the ipo proceeds  regal agreed to a modification of national cinemedia s payment obligation under the existing services agreement 
the modification extends the term of the services agreement to years  provides national cinemedia with a five year right of first refusal beginning one year prior to the end of the term and changes the basis upon which regal is paid by national cinemedia from a percentage of revenues associated with advertising contracts entered into by national cinemedia to a monthly theatre access fee 
the theatre access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron and a fixed payment per digital screen  which will increase by every five years starting at the end of fiscal for payments per patron and by annually starting at the end of fiscal for payments per digital screen 
also  with respect to any on screen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire  regal is required to purchase such time from national cinemedia at a negotiated rate 
in addition  after completion of the ipo  regal expects to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from national cinemedia 
regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of per share on each outstanding share of the company s class a and class b common stock  including outstanding restricted stock see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  or approximately million in the aggregate  during the year ended december  on february   the company declared a cash dividend of per share on each share of the company s class a and class b common stock including outstanding restricted stock  payable on march   to stockholders of record on march  we  at the discretion of the board of directors and subject to applicable law  anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our class a and class b common stock for the foreseeable future 
the amount  if any  of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash  anticipated cash needs  overall financial condition  loan agreement restrictions  future prospects for earnings and cash flows  as well as other relevant factors 
as of december   the holders of our convertible senior notes due may  the convertible senior notes had the right  at their option  to convert their convertible senior notes  in whole or in part  into shares of our class a common stock  subject to certain limitations  at the then existing conversion price per share 
the convertible senior notes allow us to settle any conversion  and we have the ability and intent to settle any conversion  by remitting to the note holder the accreted value of the note in cash plus the conversion spread the excess conversion value over the accreted value in either cash  shares of our class a common stock or a combination of stock and cash 
during the year ended december   holders of million in principal amount of convertible senior notes exercised their conversion rights 
the company elected to settle these conversions entirely in cash for approximately million 
as a result of these conversions  the company recorded a million loss on debt extinguishment including a related million write off of unamortized debt issue costs during the year ended december  in connection with the above conversions  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from credit suisse first boston csfb attributable to the convertible note hedge arrangement entered into with csfb and the warrant sold to csfb in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes 
such proceeds were recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
based upon our ability to generate cash flow from operations  our financial capacity and ability to borrow or raise capital and available cash on hand  we believe that we have the ability to generate the liquidity necessary to settle in cash the remaining principal amount of the outstanding convertible senior notes upon their conversion 
on june   regal cinemas borrowed million under the prior senior credit facility  the net proceeds of which were applied to reimburse regal cinemas for amounts previously distributed to the company to fund the company s settlement of the conversion of approximately million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes for approximately million in cash net of approximately million funded by csfb 
on october   regal cinemas entered into a fifth amended and restated credit agreement the amended senior credit facility with credit suisse  cayman islands branch as successor to credit suisse first boston  as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto  which consists of a term loan facility the term facility in an aggregate original principal amount of billion and a revolving credit facility the revolving facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million

interest rate swaps on july   regal cinemas entered into four hedging relationships via four distinct interest rate swap agreements with final maturity terms ranging from three to five years each 
on september   regal cinemas entered into an additional hedging relationship via a distinct interest rate swap agreement with a maturity term of four years 
these interest rate swaps were designated to hedge approximately  million of its variable rate debt obligations 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  regal cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from to and will receive interest at a variable rate based on the month libor 
the month libor rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three month period 
the interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter  until expiration 
at such dates  the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense 
no premium or discount was incurred upon the company entering into the interest rate swaps  because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into 
the interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as such  the company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the month libor on approximately  million of debt 
the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings 
as interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the designated hedging instruments the five interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps is based on dealer quotes  and represents an estimate of the amounts regal cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors  including current interest rates 
as of december   the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined to be approximately million  which has been recorded as a component of other non current assets with a corresponding amount of million  net of tax  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the interest rate swaps exhibited no ineffectiveness for the years ended december   december  and december  sale leaseback transactions for information regarding our various sale and leaseback transactions  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions  which include those related to film costs  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions 
these accounting principles require that we estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities  including the related deferred tax assets and liabilities related to such amounts 
the estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets specifies that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment 
based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the goodwill  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
we estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management s best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors 
generally  less than one third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period end 
the length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play  but is typically settled within two to three months of a particular film s opening release 
upon settlement with our film distributors  film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement 
such adjustments have been historically insignificant 
actual film costs and film costs payable could differ materially from those estimates 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures 
we depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
each owned theatre consists of a building structure  structural improvements  seating and concession and film display equipment 
while we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than years to certain acquired facilities  we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life to us of years 
certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than forty years 
with respect to equipment eg  concession stand  point of sale equipment  etc  a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less  which has been our historical replacement period 
seats and projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life  and their depreciable lives years are based on our experience and replacement practices 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized 
further  we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary 
actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates 
the majority of our properties were appraised as part of the bankruptcy process described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
such appraisals supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes 
furthermore  our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies 
finally  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets  such assets are written down to fair value 
our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical wear and tear or functional inadequacy or obsolescence factors 
in this regard  we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization  or the methodology applied 
for the fiscal year ended december   consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was million  representing of consolidated total revenues 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately million or 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately million or 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on their probable tax treatment 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
an increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
with the exception of valuation allowances recorded relative to pre acquisition periods  decreases in the valuation allowance generally result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes 
should we ultimately realize a benefit from tax assets in excess of the amount recorded that relates to pre acquisition periods  goodwill would be reduced to the extent of such excess or recorded goodwill  as appropriate 
additionally  income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment by us and may be challenged by the tax authorities 
accordingly  although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we establish accruals relative to tax uncertainties that we deem to be probable of loss and that can be reasonably estimated 
such accruals are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes 
among other items deemed relevant by us  the evaluations are based on new legislation  other new technical guidance  judicial proceedings  and our specific circumstances  including the progress of tax audits 
with the exception of certain changes in pre acquisition tax uncertainties  any change in the balance of an accrual established relative to a tax uncertainty impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that the adjustment is made to the accrual 
for the fiscal year ended december   our provision for income taxes was million 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained  the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate 
a one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from to would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately million
