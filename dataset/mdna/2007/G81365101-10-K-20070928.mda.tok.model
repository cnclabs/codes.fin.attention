we sold our last remaining south african operations in november we still have significant assets that are denominated in south african rand 
the assets include cash and notes receivables 
currently we do not have a financial hedging program to protect against the depreciation of the south african rand against the us dollar and  therefore  as long as we hold assets in south africa we will continue to record income statement gains or losses to the extent that the rand s value fluctuates relative to the us dollar 
on november   we acquired all of the assets and certain liabilities of fantasy sports from goracing interactive services  inc and on april   we disposed of substantially all the assets and liabilities of fantasy sports 
on april   we acquired strategy first through the jurisdiction of the montreal bankruptcy court 
pursuant to the approved plan of arrangement  we paid cash consideration to the creditors of strategy first of  we issued  shares of our common stock  warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  and assumed approximately  in existing bank debt  as well as contingent consideration based on the future profitability of strategy first 
founded in  strategy first publishes software games primarily for the pc platform 
some of its popular games include orb  the disciples franchise  sacred lands  kohan immortal sovereigns  steel beasts  galactic civilizations  and the jagged alliance franchise

based on these acceptances  the company announced a formal closing of the office to empire shareholders effective december  the company paid consideration to the shareholders as follows approximately million paid on closing  an additional million in loan notes payable october   and further contingent consideration based on empire s ebidta for the months ended june  based on empire s ebitda for the months ended june   the additional contingent consideration in connection with this acquisition will be million 
this amount is due and payable on april  results of operations due to the acquisition of empire during fiscal year the disposal of the assets of fantasy sports  in fiscal year and the acquisition of strategy first during fiscal year the following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may not provide an accurate comparison between the current and past fiscal years 
the fiscal year ending june  includes seven months of operating results for empire 
the results for fantasy sports are classified as discontinued operations in the fiscal years ending june  and two months of operating results for strategy first are included in the fiscal year ending june  fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues net revenues increased to approximately  for fiscal year as compared to approximately  in fiscal year this increase was due to the operations of empire which generated revenues of approximately  during fiscal year revenues were generated by the operations of strategy first alone 
cost of sales cost of sales was approximately  for fiscal  or of total revenues 
cost of sales for empire was approximately  or of related sales  while cost of sales for strategy first was approximately  or of related sales 
for fiscal year  cost of sales was approximately  or of sales 
this decrease in gross margin is primarily the result of lower gross margins for console games  which make up the majority of empire s sales  as opposed to pc products 
in fiscal year a significant portion of strategy first s sales were generated through foreign royalty sales  which had no associated cost of sales 
development costs and royalties development costs and royalties were approximately  for fiscal year development costs and royalties for empire totaled approximately  for fiscal year royalty costs for strategy first were approximately  for fiscal year as compared to approximately  during the prior fiscal year 
royalty expenses decreased as strategy first sold less outside products in fiscal year development expenditures capitalized during fiscal year were approximately  development costs are incurred by empire 
to date strategy first has outsourced development in exchange for future distribution rights 
amortization of development costs during fiscal year was approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses for empire interactive were approximately  while selling  general and administrative expenses for strategy first were approximately  corporate overhead was approximately  for fiscal year  selling general and administrative expenses were approximately  of which strategy first accounted for approximately  with corporate overhead accounting for approximately  the increase in corporate overhead was primarily the result of increased professional fees and stock based compensation expense during the fiscal year amortization and depreciation amortization of acquired intangible assets increased to approximately  during fiscal year as compared to approximately  in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the empire transaction of approximately  depreciation expenses were approximately  for fiscal year and approximately  in the same period in the prior fiscal year 
depreciation expense for empire was approximately  for fiscal year foreign currency gains losses foreign currency gains during the fiscal year were approximately  empire realized foreign currency gains of approximately  and strategy first realized foreign currency gains of approximately  the foreign currency losses during fiscal year were approximately  consisting of foreign currency losses of approximately  related to the remaining assets from the sale of discontinued south african operations  approximately  in gains recognized by strategy first and approximately  in gains recognized by the parent company 
acquisition costs incurred during fiscal year we incurred approximately  in direct costs plus additional costs in related to securing financing for an unsuccessful acquisition of and subsequent litigation against a european software company 
we are seeking damages for breach of contract from this european software company 
the case has been concluded and we are currently awaiting a verdict form the vienna district court  which is expected in the next few weeks 
amortization of convertible debt discounts and issuance costs amortization of convertible debt discounts and issuance costs were approximately  in fiscal year as compared to approximately  in fiscal year we began amortizing convertible debt discounts and amortization costs during the second quarter of fiscal year amortization expenses were lower as compared to fiscal year as a result of the extending the maturity date of the debentures to april  during the current fiscal year 
interest expense interest expense of approximately  was recorded during fiscal year as compared to approximately  in fiscal year interest expense increased as a result of significant increases in debt obligations that occurred during fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
this increase is partially attributable to the empire line of credit which stood at approximately  at june  interest income interest income of approximately was recorded during the fiscal year as compared to interest income of approximately  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease of approximately  is primarily the result of the company s decrease in the average cash balances held during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
provision for income taxes we are registered in bermuda  where no income tax laws are applicable to us 
two of our subsidiaries are subject to us income taxes  four subsidiaries are subject to united kingdom income taxes  one subsidiary is subject to canadian income taxes and one of our subsidiaries is subject to south african income taxes 
none of them has had taxable income because each of them has incurred losses for tax purposes 
the deferred tax asset generated by the tax losses and temporary differences has been fully reserved with the exception of approximately  carried as a long term asset that will be offset against future taxable earnings of empire in the united kingdom 
in april  our first south african subsidiary received a letter from the south african revenue service sars challenging certain tax treatment of dividends and operating loss carry forwards for the years through subsequently sars issued two tax assessments for approximately million 
the company had contended that its south african tax filings were in full compliance with all applicable laws and had vigorously defended its position in this regard 
the company had retained an amount of cash equal to the assessments in south africa to satisfy any potential liability that may arise 
in may   the company through an arbitration procedure with sars reached an agreement whereby sars agreed in principle to drop the larger of its two assessments 
the company conceded the principle of sars second assessment 
on august   the company paid approximately  to sars in regard to this assessment 
the company is vigorously disputing a further amount of approximately  and believes it has strong arguments in this regard based on among other factors  computational errors made by sars in its assessment 
based on its payments to sars  the company has reduced its estimated liability to approximately  as of august  the company believes its remaining liability to sars is lower than this amount  however  in the event its arguments are unsuccessful  it may be forced to increase this liability 
discontinued operations during fiscal year  we recognized income of approximately  from the discontinued operations of fantasy sports  inc on april   we sold all the assets and certain liabilities of fantasy sports  inc to fun technologies  llc which resulted in a recognized gain of approximately 
in fiscal year  the company had no discontinued operations 
net loss we have recognized an operating ebitda gain of approximately million during fiscal year compared to an operating ebitda loss of approximately million for the prior fiscal year 
our operating loss for the fiscal year was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal year we incurred amortization expenses for software development and acquired intangibles of approximately million as compared to  in prior fiscal year 
we incurred a net loss of approximately million as compared to approximately million in the previous fiscal year 
the increase in the net loss was primarily caused by increases in the depreciation and amortization of software development costs and acquired intangibles of approximately million in fiscal year as well decreases in income recognized from discontinued operations of approximately  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the calculation used to compute operating ebitda for the fiscal years ended june  and was computed as follows operating loss as reported add back amortization of software development costs amortization of acquired intangibles depreciation operating ebitda for fiscal year  net loss includes non cash foreign currency losses of approximately  as compared to gains of approximately  in the current fiscal year   expensed for an estimated foreign tax liability as compared to in the current fiscal year  approximately  incurred for abandoned acquisition costs as compared to in the current fiscal year  and approximately  of amortization costs related to the issuance of our  convertible debt as compared to approximately  during the year ended june  fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues revenues increased approximately  to  in fiscal year as compared to approximately  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenues in was primarily the result of including operations from strategy first for a full year in fiscal year as compared to two months in fiscal year cost of sales cost of sales increased approximately  to approximately  in fiscal year as compared to approximately  in the prior fiscal year 
cost of sales relate solely to the operations of strategy first 
the increase in cost of sales was primarily the result of including operations from strategy first for a full year in fiscal year as compared to two months in fiscal year development costs and royalties royalties increased approximately  to approximately  in fiscal year as compared to approximately  in the prior fiscal year 
royalty expenses relate solely to the operations of strategy first 
the increase in cost of sales was primarily the result of including operations from strategy first for a full year in fiscal year as compared to two months in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  to approximately  in fiscal year as compared to approximately  in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses related to corporate overhead were approximately  in fiscal year and approximately  in fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of including operations from strategy first for a full year in fiscal year as compared to two months in fiscal year strategy first s sales  general and administrative expenses were approximately  in fiscal year as compared to approximately  in fiscal year when only two months operations were recorded 
included in these amounts are stock based compensation charges of approximately  for fiscal year as compared to approximately  in fiscal year amortization and depreciation amortization of intangible assets was approximately  in fiscal year as compared to approximately  in fiscal year the increase was due to the full year amortization of intangible assets related to strategy first in fiscal year as compared to two months in fiscal year depreciation expense was approximately  in fiscal year as compared to approximately  in fiscal year the increase is related to strategy first s operations being recorded for the full year in foreign currency gains losses foreign currency gains or losses are almost exclusively related to the assets remaining from the sale of discontinued south african operations 
the foreign currency losses during fiscal year were approximately  as compared to approximate gains of  in fiscal year these gains or losses are primarily the result of the fluctuations of the south african rand against the us dollar 
during fiscal year  the south african rand depreciated approximately against the us dollar  while it depreciated approximately in fiscal year in fiscal year  the increase in the market value of our south african rand put us dollar call option offset the foreign currency losses which resulted in an overall gain for the year 
these foreign currency gains are non cash items until converted into us dollars when any accumulated gains or losses will be converted into cash 
during the year ended june   we received approximately r  south african rand approximately  as final payment of notes and interest owed by salwin pty  ltd 
acquisition costs incurred during fiscal year  we incurred approximately  pursuing the unsuccessful acquisition of and subsequent litigation against a european software company 
we are seeking damages for breach of contract from this european software company 
amortization of convertible debt discounts and issuance costs amortization of convertible debt discounts and issuance costs were approximately  in fiscal year there were no charges of this nature in fiscal year these expenses relate to the issuance of our  convertible debenture to dkr oasis soundshore in october interest income interest income of  was recorded during fiscal as compared to interest income of  in fiscal interest income is primarily earned on cash balances as well as on notes receivable from the sale of our south african businesses 
interest income is  therefore affected by the fluctuation of movements in the us and south african interest rates as well as by the fluctuation of the south african rand against the us dollar 
interest expense interest expense during fiscal was  as compared to  in the prior year 
this increase is attributable to interest incurred in connection with the issuance of our million convertible debenture to dkr oasis soundshore in october provision for income taxes we are registered in bermuda  where no income tax laws are applicable 
two of our subsidiaries are subject to us income taxes  one subsidiary is subject to canadian income taxes and one is subject to south african income taxes 
up to this date  none of them has had taxable income as they have incurred losses for tax purposes 
the deferred tax asset generated by the tax losses and temporary differences has been fully reserved 
in early april  our subsidiary first south african holdings received a letter from the south african revenue service sars challenging certain tax treatment of dividends and operating loss carry forwards for the years through subsequently sars has issued an assessment for approximately million 
we believe that our south african tax filings are in full compliance with all applicable laws and are vigorously defending its position in this regard 
however  until such time as these issues are resolved  we will retain cash in an amount approximately equal to the assessment in south africa to satisfy any potential liability that may arise 
not withstanding the above and after reviewing this potential liability with outside experts and conducting a further review into the circumstances of the assessment  we have recorded an estimated liability of approximately  at this time 
we will continue to vigorously defend our position in this matter 
however  circumstances may dictate that we increase this liability as we proceed 
there is  therefore  no assurance that the  amount will be sufficient to offset the ultimate tax liability 
conversely  we believe that we have strong defenses in this matter and we may ultimately obtain a ruling that results in a lesser liability 
as this is a fluid situation  we will assess our liability in this regard on a quarterly basis and may adjust this  liability in the future 
discontinued operations during fiscal year  we recognized income of approximately  from the discontinued operations of fantasy sports  inc as compared to approximately  in fiscal year on april   we sold all the assets and certain liabilities of fantasy sports  inc to fun technologies  llc which resulted in a recognized gain of approximately net income we have recognized a net loss of approximately  during fiscal year compared to net income of approximately  during the prior fiscal year 
for fiscal year  net loss includes non cash foreign currency losses of approximately   accrued for an estimated foreign tax liability  approximately  costs incurred within an abandoned acquisition and approximately  of amortization costs related to the issuance of our  convertible debenture 
during fiscal year  we recognized approximately  in non cash foreign currency gains and did not incur any expenses in regard to foreign tax liabilities  abandoned acquisition costs  and convertible debt amortization 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash decreased by approximately  from  at june  to approximately  at june  this decrease is primarily the result of the acquisition cost incurred in connection with the purchase of empire 
the cash balances are being held for acquisitions and working capital purposes 
included in this amount is  which is classified as restricted cash 
this amount relates to cash used to secure borrowings of our subsidiary  strategy first  as well as money retained in south africa to satisfy any potential liability that may result from our tax dispute with the south african revenue 
working capital decreased by approximately  from approximately  at june  to a deficit of approximately  on june  the decrease is primarily due to the acquisition of empire  which resulted in significant decreases to the cash balance and significant increases in current liabilities 
current liabilities acquired as part of the acquisition of empire exceeded current assets acquired by  current notes payable to empire shareholders totaled approximately  as of june  the current portion of our convertible secured debentures decreased  as compared to june  as a result of the modification to our debt agreement which extended the maturity to april  on june   empire owed approximately  for united kingdom payroll taxes of which approximately  was past due 
payroll liabilities totaling approximately  for the months of may and june were paid in july with the agreement of the tax authorities and were not subject to penalties 
a payment schedule for the remaining past due balance of  is currently being finalized 
as of june   the interest rate in effect for late tax payments was 
interest is automatically charged for the period following april  on the amount that was still due at that date 
in addition  the united kingdom tax authorities have the power to charge this rate of interest on overdue payroll taxes in respect to periods prior to april   however  in practice  this is rare 
at june  we had borrowings of approximately  which consisted of approximately  in empire s line of credit and approximately  advances against the corporate line of credit  secured by the company s cash 
additionally  we have two outstanding debentures issued to dkr soundshore oasis  with a combined face value of  net of repayments or costs incurred 
we currently pay monthly interest on this amount at a rate of prime plus  subject to reduction based on our share price 
we also have note obligations to empire shareholders of approximately  that accrue interest at an annual rate of and are payable in full on october  additionally  there is an earn out payable to former empire shareholders 
the earn out is based on a formula of empire s ebitda for the fiscal year ended june  the amount payable computed using the earn out formula totaled approximately  at june  and is due to former empire shareholders on april  as of june   our balance sheet reflects a working capital deficit 
until recently our operations have not generated positive operating ebitda or earnings and there is no guarantee that our recent profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal year will be sustained 
however  we believe that a combination of our cash on hand  operating cash flow and additional financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our short and long term obligations 
management s plans to meet its ongoing cash requirement as follows raise additional capital through the sale of equity or additional debt 
to this end the company announced on september  that it had completed a million private placement of common stock and warrants with institutional investors and management 
silverstar sold a total of  shares at per share 
investors also received five year warrants to purchase approximately  shares of common stock at per share 
the company may seek to raise additional debt or equity during the fiscal year 
the company amended the terms of its secured convertible debentures with dkr soundshore oasis in june under the terms of the amendment i the maturity dates of the debentures were extended to april   ii there will be no amortization of principal under the debentures and iii the debentures will be mandatorily convertible if the closing sale price of the company s common stock equals or exceeds per share 
the mandatory conversion will be subject to volume requirements 
furthermore an amount of million of this convertible debenture had been converted and the company has issued  shares of class a common stock 
generate significant short term operating earnings and cash flow primarily through its newly acquired subsidiary empire 
empire s first next generation version of its best selling flat out franchise has performed well in europe  generating significant cash flow and is anticipated to meet or exceed the company s sales expectations in the future 
furthermore  as of september   the company anticipates that empire s ongoing business which includes planned releases in the next months of such high profile titles as jackass  hello kitty and pipemania  will generate operating profits and cash flow in the short term 
the company has received a commitment from a lender for a two year million loan 
the company and the lender are currently negotiating the terms and conditions of the loan 
management believes that these actions and others to be taken by the company will provide the opportunity for it to improve liquidity and achieve profitability 
however  there can be no assurance that all such events will occur to realize these goals 
contractual obligations the following table is a summary of contractual obligations as of june payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years obligations to former empire shareholders convertible debt obligations interest payable operating lease obligations purchase obligations employment contracts total future commitments through june   strategy first has sustained operating losses 
we anticipate that this situation will be remedied through a combination of increased revenues through sustained new game releases as well as a reduction in expenses 
strategy first and empire are projecting an operating profit for the coming twelve months 
there are no assurances that these expectations will be met 
in this event  we may need to continue to support the operations of our subsidiaries 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and we are not a party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 
critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our operations revenue recognition empire and strategy first distribute the majority of their products through third party software distributors to mass merchant and major retailers and directly to certain entertainment software retailers  all of which have traditionally sold consumer entertainment software products 
additionally  the companies may license their products to distributors in exchange for royalty payments 
the distribution of products is governed by purchase orders  distribution agreements or direct sale agreements  most of which allow for product returns and price markdowns 
for product shipments to these software distributors or retailers  the companies record a provision for product returns and price markdowns as a reduction of gross sales at the time the product passes to these distributors or retailers 
the provision for anticipated product returns and price markdowns is primarily based upon the company s analysis of historical product return and price markdown results 
should product sell through results at retail store locations fall significantly below anticipated levels the adequacy of this allowance may be insufficient 
the companies review the adequacy of their respective allowances for product returns and price markdowns and if necessary make adjustments 
in the case of royalty income  the company records this income when earned based on sales reports from its distributors 
in many cases  the companies receive guaranteed royalty income and these revenues are recorded upon signing of the royalty agreements 
these amounts are carried as accounts receivable until paid 
development costs in the past  empire has incurred significant software development costs in connection with the production of their products 
under sfas no 
software development cost should be capitalized once technical feasibility is achieved 
in the case of empire this would be when the product is commercially viable commercial feasibility 
empire s management had taken the position that commercial feasibility is reached very late in the development process and therefore had not capitalized any development costs in regard to their products 
as reported in the company s form q a for the quarter ended december   the company was in the process of evaluating the appropriateness of this position by performing its own analysis to determine as to when commercial feasibility is reached 
this analysis was completed during the quarter ending march  based on this analysis  the company determined to its satisfaction that there is a clearly defined decision point quite early in development where a product passes from concept to commercial feasibility 
this decision point is either reached with the consent of outside parties such as sony or microsoft or through an internal process where management decides to move forward with a product s development once a game concept has been approved 
the company also found that there has been no material instance where concept approval has been given and a game has not become a commercial product 
the company has  therefore  decided to capitalize software development costs after concept approval 
during the quarter ended december     based on the december  foreign exchange rate of us dollars to the uk pound of software development costs were expensed 
this had the effect of reducing the march  quarter s loss by   based on the quarter ended march  foreign exchange rate of us dollars to the uk pound and represents the amount of software development cost expensed during the quarter ended december   capitalized during the current quarter ended march  the table sets forth below the effect on the quarterly earnings had the company capitalized its software development costs starting on december fiscal year quarter quarter quarter quarter ended ended ended ended ended net income loss as reported effect of change in estimate net loss assuming capitalization starting december  income loss per share as reported basic diluted income loss per share assuming capitalization starting december  basic diluted goodwill valuation goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired 
the process of determining goodwill requires judgment 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
for those reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate 
the company reviews goodwill annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of june  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
while the company believes that no impairment existed as of june   there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to an impairment of goodwill 
intangible assets intangible assets include software game titles and non competition agreements 
intangible assets  excluding goodwill and empire game titles are stated on the basis of cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated lives of three to ten years 
empire game titles are amortized over a five year period based on weighted average expected sales from the date the title is launched 
for titles that have not yet been launched as of june  a launch date was estimated to project future amortization 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually unless circumstances dictate otherwise 
management periodically reviews intangible assets for impairment based on an assessment of undiscounted future cash flows  which are compared to the carrying value of the intangible assets 
should these cash flows not equal or exceed the carrying value of the intangible  a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the extent of any impairment charge required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not ordinarily hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the company does  however  recognize market risk from interest rate and foreign currency exchange exposure 
interest rate risk on june   our cash resources earned interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s return on these funds is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
the company also has significant debt that is tied to interest rates and  therefore  any increase in interest rates will have a negative effect on the company s interest payments 
at june   the company had two convertible notes outstanding with a combined balance of approximately million 
the interest on these convertible notes is based on a floating rate equal to prime plus 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate  change in annual interest expense 
in addition to the convertible debentures the company had a secured line of credit facility at june  based on the june  balance on this facility  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximately  change in annual interest expense 
empire has a line of credit secured by its receivables  inventory  real property and intangible assets 
as of june   the amount outstanding under this facility was approximately  the line of credit accrues interest at an annual rate of 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximately  change in annual interest expense 
foreign currency risk the majority of the assets and liabilities of the company are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the pound sterling  canadian dollar  or the south african rand 
as such the company is exposed to foreign currency risks 
empire is incorporated in the united kingdom 
empire sells products throughout the world 
its functional currency is the pound sterling 
this has exposed the company to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of the major currencies particularly the euro  british pound  and the us dollar 
strategy first is incorporated in canada and sells products throughout the united states and europe 
its functional currency is the canadian dollar 
this has exposed the company to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of the euro  british pound  the canadian dollar  and the us dollar 
certain of the company s cash balances and the remaining proceeds from the sale of its south african subsidiaries are denominated in south african rand 
this has exposed the company to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of the south african rand against the us dollar 
net revenues by currency as reported in us dollars for the fiscal years ending june  and were as follows euros pound sterling us dollars canadian dollars total net revenues
