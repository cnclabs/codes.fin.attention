item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialized asset management company that uses industry specific expertise to generate and administer investment opportunities in the commercial finance  real estate and financial fund management sectors 
as a specialized asset manager  we seek to develop investment funds for outside investors for which we provide asset management services 
we typically maintain an investment in the investment vehicles we sponsor 
as of september   we managed billion of assets 
as of november   we managed billion of assets 
we limit our fund development and asset management services to asset classes in which we have specific expertise 
we believe this strategy enhances the return on investment we can achieve for ourselves and for the investors in our funds 
in our commercial finance operations  we focus on originating small and middle ticket equipment leases and commercial notes secured by business essential equipment  including technology  commercial and industrial equipment and medical equipment 
in our real estate operations  we concentrate on investments in multi family and commercial real estate and real estate mortgage loans including whole loans  first priority interests in commercial mortgage loans  known as a notes  subordinated interests in first mortgage loans  known as b notes  and mezzanine loans 
in our financial fund management operations  we concentrate on trust preferred securities of banks  bank holding companies  insurance companies and other financial companies  bank loans  asset backed securities we have greatly expanded all three sectors since and assets under management have grown from billion  excluding our former energy subsidiary  at september  to billion at september  we distribute our products through numerous channels including a highly proprietary large broker dealer financial planner network 
as a specialized asset manager  we are affected by conditions in the financial markets and  in particular  have been affected by the recent volatility and reduction in liquidity in the global credit markets 
these conditions have resulted in our recording the following a million charge  net of tax  to reflect the other than temporary impairment of certain investments  primarily equity investments in a portfolio of asset backed securities managed by us  a million charge  net of tax  to reflect losses from the sale of loans held for investment taken in order to reduce exposure to corporate bank loans  principally in europe  and a charge of million  net of tax  related to a european real estate investment fund that did not close due to the unfavorable market conditions 
principally as a result of these charges  our net income in fiscal decreased significantly from our net income for fiscal and we attract investment funds through the sponsorship of investment vehicles  which historically have included public and private investment partnerships  tic programs  a reit and cdo issuers 
we arrange for the funding of these vehicles through short  medium and longer term bank financing  equity investments and  historically  cdos 
we believe that we have developed a unique combination of origination channels to provide such funding  including a network of international and national banks and investment banks both for our short  medium and longer term debt financing including  historically  our cdos and for equity financing of rcc  and a national network of independent broker dealers for our investment partnerships and tic programs 
we believe that current credit market conditions have created opportunities for us  principally in our commercial finance business 
in commercial finance  we acquired the equipment leasing division of pacific capital bank in june and  subsequent to our fiscal year end  acquired the equipment leasing division of netbank from the fdic  out of receivership  and the equipment finance subsidiary of lehman brothers bank  fsb 
the two acquisitions subsequent to our fiscal year end increased our commercial finance assets under management by billion  to approximately billion as of november  in real estate  we acquired a real estate property management group on october   that will allow us to directly manage properties held by the real estate investment programs we manage 
we also  on behalf of an institutional joint venture partner  purchased a portfolio of mortgage loans from hud  at a substantial discount 
in our third sector  financial fund management  we completed five collateralized debt obligation  or cdo  issuances in the second half of fiscal in addition  one cdo priced subsequent to fiscal year end and we expect it to close in december of these six cdos  three were collateralized loan obligation  or clo issuances  including the one we expect to close in december due to the current state of the credit markets we believe that the cdo market in general will slow substantially in limiting our ability to generate additional assets under management through this channel  although  we believe that current market conditions have had less effect on our ability to sponsor clos and  consequently  we may be able to sponsor clo vehicles in even under current market conditions  we expect that our financial fund management sector will provide us with a continuing stream of fee income from existing cdos and funds we manage 
assets under management we increased our assets under management by billion to billion at september  from billion at september  the growth in our assets under management was the result of an increase in the financial fund management assets we manage on behalf of individual and institutional investors and rcc  both in the united states and in europe  an increase in real estate assets managed on behalf of rcc and limited partnerships and tic property interests that we sponsor  and an increase in commercial finance assets managed on behalf of the limited partnerships we sponsor  and rcc

we support our real estate investment partnerships by making long term limited partnership investments 
in addition  from time to time  we make bridge investments in the underlying partnerships and tic property interests to facilitate acquisitions 
we record losses on these equity method investments primarily as a result of depreciation and amortization expense recorded by the partnerships and tic property interests 
as additional investors are admitted to the partnerships and tic programs  we transfer our bridge investment to new investors at our original cost and recognize a gain approximately equal to the previously recognized loss 
gains on resolution of loans  fin r assets and other real estate assets if any and the amount of fees received if any vary from transaction to transaction 
there have been in the past  and we expect that in the future there will be  significant period to period variations in our gains on resolution and fee income

our effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operation  before taxes was for compared to a effective rate for fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate primarily relates to the greater impact of permanent items due to the lower pre tax earnings for fiscal additionally  we recorded million of tax benefits related to adjustments to our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances in fiscal as compared to million of adjustments in fiscal our effective income tax rate  as adjusted to exclude the valuation adjustments  the fourth quarter million loan impairment charge and the million write off of the domestic portion of the european fund costs  would have been for fiscal we expect our effective tax rate to be between and for fiscal our effective income tax rate can vary from period to period depending on  among other factors  the geographic and business mix of our earnings and the level of our tax credits 
certain of these and other factors  including our history of pre tax earnings  are taken into account in assessing our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our provision for taxes

fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative costs were million for fiscal  an increase of million as compared to million for fiscal we attribute the increase to the following a million increase in stock based compensation expense due to our implementation of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  r  accounting for stock based compensation  as revised  resulting in a change in our method of recognizing share based compensation expense 
specifically  we now record compensation expense for our employee stock options

our effective tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate reflects the tax planning strategies that we initiated in fiscal offset  in part  by increased state income taxes in conjunction with the increased profitability of our operating segments 
in connection with the implementation of these tax planning strategies  the tax rate for fiscal reflected the reversal of million of a previously recorded valuation allowance against state net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million 
in addition  we recorded a deferred tax asset of million associated with approximately million of local nols for which we had previously believed would not be realized prior to their statutory expiration date 
our effective tax rate  as adjusted to exclude the benefit from the change in the valuation allowance and recording the additional local deferred tax asset  would have been for fiscal we expect our effective tax rate to be in fiscal future tax rates could change if estimates of taxable income change or if there are changes in our recorded nols or their related valuation allowances

as a specialized asset manager  we sponsor investment funds in which we may make an equity investment along with outside investors 
this equity investment is generally based on a percentage of funds raised and varies among investment programs 
we are a party to employment agreements with certain executives that provide for compensation and certain other benefits 
the agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances 
we are a party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
management believes that none of these actions  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
as of september   we do not believe it is probable that any payments will be required under any of our indemnifications and accordingly  no liabilities for these obligations have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and cost and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the provision for possible losses  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and identifiable intangible assets  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition fee income rcc management fees rcc invests in a diversified portfolio of b notes  cmbs and other real estate related loans and commercial finance assets 
we receive fees and are reimbursed for our expenses for the management of rcc as follows a monthly base management fee equal to th of the amount of rcc s equity  as defined by the management agreement  multiplied by  incentive compensation based on the products of i of the dollar amount by which  a rcc s net income per common share before non cash equity compensation expense and incentive compensation for a quarter based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding exceeds  b an amount equal to the weighted average share price of shares of common stock in the offerings of rcc  multiplied by the greater of a or b plus one fourth of the ten year treasury rate as defined in the management agreement for such quarter  multiplied by ii the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the quarter 
the calculation may be adjusted for one time events due to changes in gaap as well as other non cash charges upon approval of the independent directors of rcc  and out of pocket expenses and certain other costs incurred by us associated with rcc and its operations 
the quarterly incentive compensation is payable seventy five percent in cash and twenty five percent in restricted shares of rcc common stock 
we may elect to receive more than of our incentive compensation in rcc restricted stock 
however  our ownership percentage in rcc  direct and indirect  cannot exceed 
all shares are fully vested upon issuance  provided that we may not sell such shares for one year after the incentive compensation becomes due and payable 
the restricted stock is valued at the average of the closing prices of rcc common stock over the thirty day period ending three days prior to the issuance of such shares 
we account for the rcc restricted stock and stock options received in accordance with eitf  accounting by a grantee for an equity instrument to be received in conjunction with providing goods or services 
the terms of the stock award agreement provide that the deferred compensation be amortized over a three year graded vesting period 
the unvested stock and options are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the market value of rcc as performance under the agreement is completed 
furthermore  we receive an acquisition fee of of the carrying value of the commercial finance assets it sells to rcc 
in fiscal  and  the management and acquisition fees that we received from rcc were million  million and million  respectively  or  and  respectively  of its consolidated revenues 
these fees have been reported as revenues by each of our operating segments 
financial fund management fees we earn fees on assets managed on behalf of institutional and individual investors 
collateral management fees are received for managing the assets held by cdos issuers that we sponsor 
these fees  which vary by cdo  range between and of the aggregate principal balance of the collateral securities owned by the cdo issuer 
additionally  we receive fees for managing the assets held by the partnerships it sponsors and for managing their general operations 
these fees  which vary by limited partnership  range between and of the partnership capital balance 
real estate fees we receive acquisition fees of of the net purchase price of properties acquired and financing fees equal to of the debt obtained or assumed related to the properties acquired 
in conjunction with tic acquisitions  we also may receive a bridge equity fee 
we recognize these fees when we sponsored partnerships or tic programs acquire the properties and obtain the related financing 
we also receive a monthly property management fee equal to of the gross operating revenues from the underlying properties 
we typically subcontract our property management obligations to third party property managers 
we recognizes this fee monthly when earned 
additionally  we receive an annual investment management fee from the limited partnerships equal to of the gross offering proceeds of each partnership for our services 
we receive an annual asset management fee from the tic programs equal to of the gross revenues from the property in connection with our performance of our asset management responsibilities 
we receive an annual asset management fee from one limited liability company equal to of the gross revenues of the underlying properties 
these investment management fees and asset management fees are recognized ratably over each annual period 
commercial finance fees we record acquisition fees from our leasing partnerships and until september  from merrill lynch equal to a percentage of the cost of leased equipment acquired as compensation for expenses incurred related to the lease acquisition 
acquisition fees range from to 
these fees are earned at the time of the sale of the related leased equipment to our partnerships and merrill lynch 
we also record management fees for managing and servicing the leased assets acquired and earns fees at the time the service is performed 
we also currently record servicing fees ranging from to of gross rental payments received from certain parties and servicing fees that average of the managed portfolio balance from others 
further  we record fees as a reimbursement of our operating and administrative expenses incurred to manage the investment partnerships 
we recorded gains or losses on the sales of leases and notes to merrill lynch based on the present value of the estimated cash flows that it retained over the estimated outstanding period of the receivables 
this excess cash flow essentially represented an interest only  or i o strip  consisting of the present value of the finance charges and late fees in excess of the amounts paid for debt service  credit losses  and service fees 
during fiscal and  we recognized gains of  and  net of tax  respectively related to the i o strip 
on september   we terminated this program with merrill lynch 
other revenues fees from delinquent payments are recognized when received and are included in other income 
employee stock options we follow sfas  r 
accordingly  employee stock option grants are being expensed over their respective vesting periods  based on the estimated fair value of each award as determined on the date of grant 
for fiscal  we accounted for stock based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation expense was reflected in net income since each option granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
sfas r requires the disclosures of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had adopted the fair value method for stock options granted 
the following table provides the pro forma effects of recognizing compensation expense in accordance with sfas r in thousands  except per share data year ended september  net income stock based employee compensation determined under the fair value based method  net of tax pro forma net income basic earnings per share as reported pro forma diluted earnings per share as reported pro forma restricted common stock we value the restricted stock we issue based on the closing price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant 
loans loans held for investment and loans sold  not settled the cdo issuers that we manage and consolidate in accordance with fin r  purchase participations in corporate leveraged loans and commercial real estate loans in the secondary market and through syndications of newly originated loans 
these loans are held for investment  therefore  we initially record them at their purchase price  and subsequently account for them based on their outstanding principal plus or minus any unamortized premiums or discounts 
we may sell a loan held for investment if the credit fundamentals underlying a particular loan have changed in such a manner that our expected return on investment may decrease 
once we decide that it no longer will hold the loan for investment  the loan is recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value 
purchases and sales of loans held for investment are recorded on a trade date basis 
trades that did not settle as of september  were classified as loans sold  not settled on the consolidated balance sheet 
gains and or losses on sales of loans held for investment are recorded as of the trade date 
interest income on loans interest income on loans includes interest at stated rates adjusted for amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into income using the effective yield method 
when we purchase a loan or pool of loans at a discount  we consider the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  or sop to evaluate whether all or a portion of the discount represents accretable yield 
if a loan with a premium or discount is prepaid  we immediately recognize the unamortized portion as a decrease or increase to interest income 
allowance for loan losses loans held for investment are generally evaluated for impairment individually  but loans purchased on a pooled basis with relatively smaller balances and substantially similar characteristics may be evaluated collectively for impairment 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  management believes it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when a loan is impaired  the allowance for loan losses is increased by the amount of the excess of the amortized cost basis of the loan over its fair value 
fair value may be determined based on market price  if available  the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs  or the present value of estimated cash flows 
increases in the allowance for loan losses are recognized in the statements of income as a provision for loan losses 
when a loan  or a portion thereof  is considered uncollectible and pursuit of the collection is not warranted  then we will record a charge off or write down of the loan against the allowance for loan losses 
for our real estate loans included in investments in real estate in the consolidated balance sheet  we consider general and local economic conditions  neighborhood values  competitive overbuilding  casualty losses and other factors that may affect the value of loans and real estate 
the value of loans and real estate may also be affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations and liability under applicable environmental laws  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing 
income from a property will be reduced if a significant number of tenants are unable to pay rent or if available space cannot be rented on favorable terms 
in addition  we continuously monitor collections and payments from our borrowers and maintains an allowance for estimated losses based upon our historical experience and our knowledge of specific borrower collection issues 
we reduce our investments in real estate loans and real estate by an allowance for amounts that may become unrealizable in the future 
such allowance can be either specific to a particular loan or property or general to all loans and real estate 
an impaired loan may remain on accrual status during the period in which we are pursuing repayment of the loan  however  the loan would be placed on non accrual status at such time as either management believes that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming months  the loan becomes days delinquent  management determines the borrower is incapable of  or has ceased efforts toward  curing the cause of the impairment  or the net realizable value of the loan s underlying collateral approximates our carrying value of such loan 
while on non accrual status  we recognize interest income only when actual payment is received 
loans purchased at a discount we hold two real estate loans that we acquired at a discount due to credit quality  and account for these loans in accordance with sop we accrete the difference between our cost basis and the sum of projected cash flows from our loans into interest income over the estimated life of the loan using the interest method  which recognizes a level interest rate over the life of the loan 
we review projected cash flows  which include amounts realizable from the underlying properties  on a regular basis 
changes to projected cash flows  which can be based upon updated property appraisals  changes to the property and changes to the real estate market in general  reduce or increase the amounts accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
we also utilize the cost recovery method for loans when appropriate under the circumstances 
investments in commercial finance investments in commercial finance assets consist of notes receivable  direct financing leases and operating leases and merchant future receivables 
leases are recorded in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases  and its various amendments and interpretations 
notes receivable for term loans  the investment in notes receivable consists of the sum of the total future minimum loan payments receivable less unearned finance income 
unearned finance income  which is recognized as revenue over the term of the financing by the effective interest method  represents the excess of the total future minimum contracted payments over the cost of the related equipment 
for all other loans  interest income is recorded at the stated rate on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
direct financing leases certain of our lease transactions are accounted for as direct financing leases as distinguished from operating leases 
such leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
our investment in direct financing leases consists of the sum of the total future minimum contracted payments receivable and the estimated unguaranteed residual value of leased equipment  less unearned finance income 
unearned finance income  which is recognized as revenue over the term of the financing by the effective interest method  represents the excess of the total future minimum lease payments plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value expected to be realized at the end of the lease term over the cost of the related equipment 
initial direct costs incurred in the consummation of the lease are capitalized as part of the investment in lease receivables and amortized over the lease term as a reduction of the yield 
operating leases leases not meeting any of the criteria to be classified as direct financing leases are deemed to be operating leases 
under the accounting for operating leases  the cost of the leased equipment  including acquisition fees associated with lease placements  is recorded as an asset and depreciated on a straight line basis over the equipment s estimated useful life  generally up to seven years 
rental income consists primarily of monthly periodic rental payments due under the terms of the leases 
we recognize rental income on a straight line basis 
merchant future receivables merit provides capital advances to small business on future credit card receipts 
revenues from this operation are recorded under the effective interest method  wherein the amount of interest revenue recorded is directly tied to the balance or carrying amount of the receivable 
allowance for lease and note and merchant future receivable losses we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for possible losses of merchant future receivables on a quarterly basis based upon  among other factors  management s experience of portfolio default rates and subsequent collectability 
we anticipate the merchant future receivables to be collected within a one year period 
generally  during the lease terms of existing operating leases  we will not recover all of the cost and related expenses of our rental equipment and  therefore  we are prepared to remarket the equipment in future years 
our policy is to review  on a quarterly basis  the expected economic life of its rental equipment in order to determine the recoverability of its undepreciated cost 
we write down our rental equipment to its estimated net realizable value when it is probable that its carrying amount exceeds such value and the excess can be reasonably estimated  gains are only recognized upon actual sale of the rental equipment 
we generally discontinue the recognition of revenue for leases and notes for which payments are more than days past due 
investment securities available for sale we account for our investments in affiliates  financial fund management entities and other marketable securities in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
investment securities in affiliates include our holdings in the bancorp  inc  or tbbk  nasdaq tbbk and rcc 
investments in financial fund management entities include our direct investments in cdos we sponsor as well as our indirect holdings in cdos through our consolidation of the sff entities 
these investment securities are classified as available for sale and  as such  are carried at fair value 
the determination of fair value is based on independent market quotations or  when such quotations are unavailable  valuation models prepared by independent third parties or our management 
these models include estimates and the valuations derived from them could differ materially from amounts realizable in an open market exchange 
cumulative net unrealized gains and losses on these investment securities  net of tax  are reported through accumulated comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on the basis of specific identification and are included in net income 
our process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these factors include i the duration of a significant decline in value  ii the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  iii the magnitude of the decline  iv the collateral structure and other credit support  as applicable  v our intent and ability to hold the investment until the values recover  and vi for investments in cdos  the estimated cash flows 
when the analysis of the above factors results in a conclusion that a decline in fair values is other than temporary  the cost of the investment is written down to fair value as of the reporting date and any previously unrealized loss is realized in the period such a determination is made 
our interests in cdos are accounted for in accordance with eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  or eitf in accordance with eitf  when adverse changes in estimated cash flows occur as a result of declining net spread  prepayments or credit loss experience  an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
accordingly  the security is written down to fair value  and the unrealized loss is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as a reduction of current earnings 
the cost basis adjustment for other than temporary impairment is recoverable only upon the sale or maturity of the security 
dividend income is recognized on securities classified as available for sale on the ex dividend date 
recently issued financial accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations 
this statement replaces sfas  business combinations 
this statement retains the fundamental requirements in statement that the acquisition method of accounting which statement called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
this statement also establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer a recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  b recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and c determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r will apply prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after our fiscal year beginning october  while we have not yet evaluated this statement for the impact  if any  that sfas r will have on our consolidated financial statements  we will be required to expense costs related to any acquisitions after september  in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this statement amends accounting research bulletin to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  that sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year beginning october  in june  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  issued statement of position  or sop   clarification of the scope of the audit and accounting guide investment companies and accounting by parent companies and equity method investors for investments in investment companies 
this sop provides guidance for determining whether an entity is within the scope of the aicpa audit and accounting guide investment companies  or the guide 
additionally  it provides guidance as to whether a parent company or an equity method investor can apply the specialized industry accounting principles of the guide referred to as investment company accounting 
this sop is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   with early application encouraged our fiscal year beginning october  
in october  the fasb issued an exposure draft indefinitely deferring the effective date of this sop 
in may  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a staff position  or fsp  fin r  application of fasb interpretation r to investment companies 
fsp fin r amends the scope of the exception to fin r to state that investments accounted for at fair value in accordance with investment company accounting are not subject to consolidation under fin r 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  our fiscal year beginning october  
certain consolidated subsidiaries currently apply investment company accounting 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of this interpretation will have on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards 
eitf requires companies to recognize the income tax benefit realized from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and paid to employees for nonvested equity classified employee share based payment awards as an increase to additional paid in capital 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  our fiscal year beginning october  
we do not expect eitf will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the fair value option established by this sfas permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
entities choosing the fair value option would be required to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
adoption is required for fiscal years beginning after november  for us  our fiscal year beginning october  
we are currently evaluating the expected effect  if any  sfas will have on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which provides guidance on measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities 
sfas will apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
this standard will also require additional disclosures in both annual and quarterly reports 
sfas will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal year in november  the fasb announced that it would defer the effective date of sfas for one year for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we are currently determining the effect  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements 
in september  the staff of the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab   considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  prior to our application of the guidance in sab  we used the rollover method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements and concluded that they were immaterial individually and in the aggregate 
with sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the rollover methods 
sab permits existing public companies to initially apply its provisions either by i restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been applied or ii recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of a company s fiscal year  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we elected to record the effects of applying sab using the cumulative effect transition method and recorded an adjustment of  to retained earnings on october  the increase consisted of a decrease of  for salary expense to correct our accounting practice for recording incentive compensation for our employees  an increase of  for salary expense to correct the method used to record pension liability adjustments for our supplemental employee retirement plan  or serp  and an increase of  for interest expense to adjust the amount of interest owed on a mortgage loan 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
sfas requires an employer to recognize the over under funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan as an asset or liability  by recording the difference between the plan assets fair value and the benefit obligation 
the employer must recognize after tax gains and losses as a result of changes in the funded status as a component of other comprehensive income 
the employer is also required to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statements and disclose in the notes to the statements additional information regarding the net periodic benefit costs 
the adoption of sfas in fiscal did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on july   the fasb issued interpretation  or fin   accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the new accounting standard also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after december  for us  our fiscal year beginning october  with early adoption permitted if no interim financial statements have been issued 
we will not elect for early adoption of fin  accordingly  the provisions of fin will be implemented in the our first quarter ending december  we do not believe the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the following discussion is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonable possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
general we are exposed to various market risks  principally fluctuating interest rates 
these risks can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
the following analysis presents the effect on our earnings  cash flows and financial position as if hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred at september  we analyze only the potential impacts of hypothetical assumptions 
our analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
commercial finance at september   we held million in commercial finance assets  comprised of notes  leases and merchant future receivables at fixed rates of interest 
we periodically sell these assets to the investment partnerships we sponsored and manage at our cost basis  generally within three months from the date acquired 
accordingly  our exposure to changes in market interest rates on these assets is minimized 
further  we  along with our investment partnerships  maintain swap agreements to effectively fix the interest rates on the related debt  as discussed below 
in addition  we had weighted average borrowings of million under a secured revolving credit facility with morgan stanley at september  this facility is not subject to fluctuation in interest rates because we have entered into interest rate swap agreements which create a fixed interest rate on the entire balance 
real estate portfolio loans and related senior liens 
as of september   we believe that none of the three loans held in our portfolio that have senior liens are sensitive to changes in interest rates since the loans are subject to forbearance or other agreements that require all of the operating cash flow from the properties underlying the loans  after debt service on senior lien interests  to be paid to us and therefore are not currently being paid based on the stated interest rates of the loans  the senior lien interests ahead of our interests are at fixed rates and are not subject to interest rate fluctuation that would affect payments to us  and each loan has significant accrued and unpaid interest and other charges outstanding to which cash flow from the underlying property would be applied even if cash flows were to exceed the interest due  as originally underwritten 
fin r loan 
a mortgage that we consolidate at september  as a result of fin r is at a fixed interest rate and  therefore  not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
financial fund management at september   we had three outstanding secured warehouse facilities to purchase bank loans with balances of million  million apidos vi clo and million at interest rates of  and  respectively 
these facilities will be reduced by million upon the settlement of loans sold  not settled 
apidos vi is expected to close on december  a hypothetical change in the interest rates on these facilities would change our annual interest expense by a total of approximately  based on projected cdo execution dates 
other at september   we had two secured revolving credit facilities for general business use 
weighted average borrowings on these two facilities were million for fiscal at an effective interest rate of 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate on these facilities would change our annual interest expense by
