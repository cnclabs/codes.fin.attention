item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item for this annual report on form k 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
business overview we are a life science company focused on the development and commercialization of genomic based clinical diagnostic tests for cancer that allow physicians and patients to make individualized treatment decisions 
our first test  oncotype dx  is used for early stage breast cancer patients to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence  the likelihood of patient survival and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit 
all tumor samples are sent to our laboratory in redwood city  california for analysis 
upon generation and delivery of a recurrence score report to the physician  we generally bill third party payors for oncotype dx 
the list price of our test is  we launched oncotype dx in january and initially made sales to a select number of physicians in a few markets in the united states through a small direct sales force 
late in and continuing into  we experienced a significant increase in demand for oncotype dx 
for the year ended december   more than  tests were delivered for use in treatment planning  compared to more than  and more than tests delivered for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since the commercial launch of oncotype dx more than  tests have been delivered for use in treatment planning by more than  physicians 
we believe increased demand in resulted from the publication of our validation study in the new england journal of medicine and the presentation of our chemotherapy benefit study at the san antonio breast cancer symposium  both of which occurred in december we also experienced increased demand in following clinical presentations at major symposia in december and february  as well as the may publication of two peer reviewed articles supporting the use and reimbursement of oncotype dx 
the expansion of our domestic field sales organization in july also increased demand for our test 
however  this increased demand is not necessarily indicative of future growth rates  and we cannot assure you that this level of increased demand can be sustained or that future appearances or presentations at medical conferences or publication of articles will have similar impact on demand for oncotype dx 
moreover  we believe that each year we may experience decreased demand for our test in the summer months of july and august  which may be attributed to physicians  surgeons and patients scheduling vacations during this time 
as of december   our laboratory had the capacity to process up to  tests per fiscal quarter 
we believe the key factors that will drive broader adoption of oncotype dx will be acceptance by healthcare providers of its clinical benefits  demonstration of the cost effectiveness of using our test  expanded reimbursement by third party payors  expansion of our sales force and increased marketing efforts 
reimbursement of oncotype dx by third party payors is essential to our commercial success 
in general  clinical laboratory services  when covered  are paid under various methodologies  including prospective payment systems and fee schedules 

table of contents reimbursement from payors depends upon whether a test covered under the patient s policy and if payment practices for the test have been established 
as a relatively new test  oncotype dx may be considered investigational by payors and not covered under current reimbursement policies 
until we reach agreement with a payor on contract terms or a payor establishes a policy for payment of oncotype dx  we recognize revenue on a cash basis 
upon commercialization of oncotype dx  we began working with third party payors to establish reimbursement coverage policies 
as of december   aetna  inc  kaiser foundation health plan  inc 
and national heritage insurance company nhic  the local medicare carrier for california with jurisdiction for claims submitted by us for medicare patients  had issued positive coverage determinations for oncotype dx 
in january  united healthcare insurance company entered into a national laboratory services agreement to supporting reimbursement for our test 
in addition  many regional payors had issued policies supporting reimbursement for our test 
where contracts or policies are not in place  we pursue case by case reimbursement 
we believe that as much as of our future test volume may be derived from medicare patients 
we are working with many payors to establish policy level reimbursement which  if in place  should allow us to recognize revenues upon completing our test and submitting an invoice 
we do not expect to recognize the majority of revenues in this manner until late  at the earliest 
in early february  we obtained our first reimbursement coverage outside of the united states 
clalit health care  the largest government payor in israel  covering of the population  established a reimbursement coverage policy for oncotype dx for their patients 
oncotype dx is currently offered for sale in israel under a testing and services agreement with a third party 
tests ordered in israel are processed in our redwood city  california central reference laboratory 
effective december  we entered into collaborative agreements with aventis  inc  a member of the sanofi aventis group  and the eastern cooperative oncology group to investigate the ability of gene expression in fixed paraffin embedded tissues to predict the likelihood of response to adjuvant chemotherapy  including taxotere  in patients with early breast cancer and zero to three involved lymph nodes 
the agreements provide genomic health with commercial rights to diagnostic tests that may result from the collaboration and were effective as of december  we began to recognize revenue under these agreements in the first quarter of we are continuing to work on extending oncotype dx for breast cancer into n and er populations 
during  we may introduce single gene information for er and pr genes into the oncotype dx patient report to provide better information for improved treatment decision making 
also during  we plan to conduct further studies using oncotype dx in n patients which  if successful  could result in a product offering sometime in in july we signed a collaborative agreement with national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project  or nsabp  to begin work in colon cancer using our clinical development platform 
this is the same group with which we conducted our successful clinical validation studies in breast cancer which led to our development of oncotype dx 
the agreement requires certain payments to be made by us during the research and development period 
if the collaboration results in a commercial product  we will be required to make additional payments upon first commercial sale and during commercialization of the product 
at the american society of clinical oncology meeting in june  a study conducted with the nsabp was presented demonstrating correlation between gene expression and colon cancer recurrence in patients with stage ii and iii colon cancer treated with surgery 
these data support additional studies and development of an oncotype dx test for colon cancer 
during  we entered into additional agreements with nsabp and other academic institutions to further our clinical studies in colon cancer  including arrangements for a clinical validation study 
in july we signed a collaborative agreement with bristol myers squibb company and imclone systems incorporated to develop a genomic test to predict the likelihood of response to erbitux in colorectal cancer 
erbitux is a targeted therapy currently approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer 
the agreement provides for research funding support and milestone payments and gives us commercial rights to diagnostic tests that may result from the collaboration 
in december  we finalized a collaborative agreement to sponsor a research project to validate a pre specified gene panel and algorithm that will be used to predict clinical outcomes for stage ii colon cancer patients treated either with surgery alone or surgery plus chemotherapy 
the agreement requires certain payments to be 
table of contents made by us during the research and development period 
if the collaboration results in a commercial product  we will be required to make additional payments upon first commercial sale and during commercialization of the product 
we are continuing to conduct research and early development studies in a variety of cancers other than breast cancer and in january announced the decision to move our colon program for stage i and stage ii cancer patients into full scale development 
since our inception  we have generated significant net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect our net losses to continue for at least the next two years 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts over the next several years will be focused on research and development  both to develop additional tests for breast cancer and to develop tests for other cancers  to scale up our commercial organization  and for other general corporate purposes 
our financial results will be limited by a number of factors  including establishment of coverage policies by third party insurers and government payors  our ability in the short term to collect from payors often requiring a case by case manual appeals process  and our ability to recognize revenues other than from cash collections on tests billed until such time as reimbursement policies or contracts are in effect 
until we receive routine reimbursement and are able to record revenues as tests are performed and reports delivered  we are likely to continue reporting net losses 
financial operations overview revenues we derive our revenues from product sales and contract research arrangements 
we operate in one industry segment 
our product revenues are derived solely from the sale of our oncotype dx test 
payors are billed upon generation and delivery of a recurrence score report to the physician 
product revenues are recorded on a cash basis unless a contract or policy is in place with the payor at the time of billing and collectibility is reasonably assured 
contract revenues are derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recorded on an accrual basis as contractual obligations are completed 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues represents the cost of materials  direct labor  costs associated with processing tissue samples including histopathology  anatomical pathology  paraffin extraction  reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  or rt pcr  and quality control analyses  license fees and delivery charges necessary to render an individualized test result 
costs associated with performing our test are recorded as tests are processed 
license fees are recorded at the time product revenues are recognized or in accordance with other contractual obligations 
license fees represent a significant component of our cost of product revenues and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
research and development expenses research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and to carry out our clinical studies to validate our multi gene tests and include salaries and benefits  allocated overhead and facility occupancy costs  contract services and other outside costs  and costs to acquire in process research and development projects and technologies that have no alternative future use 
research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
all potential future product programs outside of breast and colon cancer are in the early development phase 
the expected time frame in which a test for one of these other cancers can be brought to market is uncertain given the technical challenges and clinical variables that exist between different types of cancers 

table of contents we do not record or maintain information regarding costs incurred in research and development on a program or project specific basis 
our research and development staff and associated infrastructure resources are deployed across several programs 
many of our costs are thus not attributable to individual programs 
we believe that allocating costs on the basis of time incurred by our employees does not accurately reflect the actual costs of a project 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development programs or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
selling and marketing expenses our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and education and promotional expenses associated with oncotype dx 
these expenses include the costs of educating physicians  laboratory personnel and other healthcare professionals regarding our genomic technologies  how our oncotype dx test was developed and validated and the value of the quantitative information that oncotype dx provides 
selling and marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education  medical meeting participation and dissemination of our scientific and economic publications related to oncotype dx 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs  legal costs  including intellectual property  accounting costs and other professional and administrative costs 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenues for our first product  oncotype dx  from the commercial launch in january through december   have largely been recognized on a cash basis because we have limited collection experience and a limited number of contracts 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  we recognized some product revenue from private payors on an accrual basis 
for the year ended december   a portion of medicare related product revenue was recognized on an accrual basis 
our product revenues for tests performed are recognized when the following criteria of revenue recognition are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
criterion is satisfied we perform the test and generate and deliver a report to the physician 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the nature of the fee charged for products or services delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
product revenues where all criteria set forth above are not met are recognized on a cash basis when cash is received 
we generally bill third party payors for oncotype dx upon generation and delivery of a recurrence score report to the physician 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and the risk of collection with the third party payor 

table of contents we usually bill the patient directly for amounts owed after multiple requests for payment have been denied or only partially paid by the insurance carrier 
as a relatively new test  oncotype dx may be considered investigational by payors and not covered under their reimbursement policies 
consequently  we pursue case by case reimbursement where policies are not in place or payment history has not been established 
in we began accruing an allowance for bad debt against our accounts receivable consistent with historical payment experience 
bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   our allowance for bad debt was  no write offs for bad debt were recorded against the allowance during the year ended december  bad debt expense was  was for the year ended december  no bad debt expense was recorded for the years ended december  and because the vast majority revenue was recorded on a cash basis 
accounts receivable over days will be written off when the appeals process is exhausted  when an unfavorable coverage decision is received  or when there is other substantive evidence that the account will not be paid 
contract revenues are derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recognized on a contract specific basis 
under certain contracts  our input  measured in terms of full time equivalent level of effort or running a set of assays through our laboratory under a contractual protocol  triggers payment obligations and revenues are recognized as costs are incurred or assays are processed 
certain contracts have payment obligations that are triggered as milestones are complete  such as completion of a successful set of experiments 
in these cases  revenues are recognized when the milestones are achieved 
stock based compensation expense through december   we accounted for stock based payment transactions under accounting principles board opinion no 
 or apb on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r  which addresses the accounting for stock based payment transactions whereby an entity receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments  including stock options 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under apb  and instead requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r is a complex accounting standard  the application of which requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions used in determining fair value 
we use the black scholes valuation method  which requires the use of estimates such as stock price volatility and expected options lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates  to value equity based compensation 
there is little historical evidence or guidance available with respect to developing these assumptions and models 
expected volatility is based on comparable peer data as well as historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life of options granted is estimated based on historical option exercise and employee termination experience and peer group data 
we have elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted under sfas r and  accordingly  prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock based compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is rendered beginning on january  stock based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas r represents expense related to stock options granted during the year ended december   as well as stock options granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january  as of december   total compensation expense related to non vested stock options not yet recognized was million  which is expected to be recognized over a period of months 
equity instruments granted to non employees are valued using the black scholes method and accounted for as prescribed by sfas r and emerging issues task force  or eitf  consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and will be subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms 
clinical collaborator costs we enter into collaboration and clinical trial agreements with clinical collaborators and record these costs as research and development expenses 
we record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by our collaborators under contract terms 

table of contents in addition to costs for research and development  under one of our collaboration agreements  we make annual payments resulting from the commercial launch of oncotype dx 
these payments are recorded in cost of product revenues as a license payment 
expense is recorded ratably over the year before the relevant payment is made 
however  either party may terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice 
if this collaborative agreement were not cancelable  a liability for the entire stream of remaining payments of million would be recorded and expense would be recognized ratably through results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  product revenues from oncotype dx were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in approximately of product revenue for the year ended december  was recorded on an accrual basis compared to for the comparable period in the balance of product revenue was recognized upon cash collection 
product revenue from medicare was million  representing of total product revenue for the year ended december   we had no product revenue from medicare in this increase was a result of the february  effective coverage date for medicare patients and the receipt of payments for tests provided to medicare patients prior to the effective coverage date 
contract revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to  for the comparable period in contract revenues represented studies assessing our gene expression technology or collaborative work in gene selection and protocol design with our pharmaceutical partners 
the increase in contract revenues reflected the initiation of the collaboration with aventis  inc  and the eastern cooperative oncology group as well as ongoing work with bristol myers squibb and imclone systems 
cost of product revenues 
for the year ended december   cost of product revenues was million for oncotype dx  consisting of tissue sample processing costs of million and license fees of million 
for the year ended december   cost of product revenues was million  consisting of tissue sample processing costs of million and license fees of  test volume for the year ended december  more than doubled over the prior year  resulting in a decrease in the cost per test delivered 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded tissue sample processing costs for oncotype dx that included direct material costs  direct labor costs  equipment costs  shipping costs and other infrastructure costs 
all costs recorded for tissue sample processing in those periods represent the cost of all the tests processed regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test 
license fees were recorded in cost of product revenues for contractual obligations and royalties due on product revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a million increase in personnel and related costs  a million increase in collaboration expense and a  increase in infrastructure related expense 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase as our investment in developing tests for cancers  including cancers other than breast cancer  continues 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the million increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due a million increase in personnel related costs  mostly to expand our domestic field sales organization  a million increase in promotional field and marketing expense   in higher travel related expenses associated with field personnel and a  increase in infrastructure related expense 
we expanded our domestic field sales force to support oncotype dx in the second half of and we expect that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to expand our sales force and conduct additional physician and patient education 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the million increase 
table of contents in general and administrative expenses included a million increase in personnel costs  million in higher billing and collection fees paid to third party billing and collection vendors  an increase of million in legal and accounting fees  an increase of  in expense to establish a bad debt reserve against accounts receivable  an increase of  in insurance related costs and an increase of  in costs for third party service providers related to being a public company  including investor relations 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we spend more on fees for billing and collections due to revenue growth and continue to incur costs associated with regulatory matters and other expenses associated with the growth of our business 
interest income 
interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in  reflecting higher average cash balances and higher market yields 
interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the comparable period in  reflecting interest expense incurred on our equipment financing line established at the end of march under which draws have been made and interest expense has been incurred 
years ended december  and revenues 
product revenues were million for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  product revenues for the year ended december  were million  as compared to  in the comparable period in product revenues were primarily recognized upon cash receipt 
a portion of product revenue was recorded on an accrual basis for the first time in the fourth quarter of contract revenues were  for the year ended december   up from  in the comparable period in contract revenues were for studies assessing our gene expression technology and initial collaborative work in gene selection with our pharmaceutical partners 
cost of product revenues 
for the year ended december   cost of product revenues was million for oncotype dx  consisting of tissue sample processing costs of million and license fees of  for the year ended december   cost of product revenues was million  consisting of tissue sample processing costs of million and license fees of  during the years ended december  and  we recorded costs for oncotype dx that included direct material costs  direct labor costs  equipment costs and other infrastructure costs 
all costs recorded for tissue sample processing in those years represent the cost of all the tests processed regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test 
license fees were recorded in cost of product revenues for contractual obligations and royalties due on product revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to million in decreased costs for clinical development programs studying distant survival and chemotherapy benefits in early stage breast cancer patients and decreased license fees of  partially offset by increased personnel costs of million and an increase of  in facilities  depreciation and other general expenses 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the million increase primarily reflected an increase of million in personnel related costs  mostly to establish a domestic field sales organization  and  in higher travel expenses associated with field sales personnel  an increase of  in field promotional and marketing expenses and an increase of  in facilities  depreciation and other general expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase in general and administrative expenses reflected an increase of million in personnel costs  stock based compensation and consulting costs  an increase of  in billing and collections fees paid to third party billing and collection vendors and a  increase in insurance related costs 
these higher costs were offset in part by a  decrease in costs related to infrastructure support 

table of contents interest income and other income expense 
interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with  in the comparable period in this  increase was due to higher average cash balances from our december preferred stock financing  our september public offering and higher interest rates during the year ended december  other expense was  for the year ended december   compared with  for the comparable period in interest expense 
interest expense was comprised of the interest on deferral of contractual payments under a collaboration agreement and interest indebtedness 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december   from  in the comparable period in the increase resulted from the initiation of an equipment financing line established in march under which draws have been made and interest expense has been incurred 
no such arrangement existed in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in august  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have not yet achieved profitability and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for at least the next two years 
we expect that our research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses will continue to grow and  as a result  we will need to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability 
we may never achieve profitability 
sources of liquidity since our inception through december   we have received net proceeds of million from the sale of preferred stock and  from the issuance of common stock to employees  consultants and directors in connection with the exercise of stock options 
in october  we completed an initial public offering and a concurrent private placement of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements have been partially financed through loans 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and debt under our equipment loan of million 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and debt under our equipment loan of million 
cash flows as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  this decrease of million was due primarily to cash used in operating activities of million and purchases of property  equipment and leasehold improvements of million  partially offset by net proceeds from our equipment loans of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in operating activities of million was primarily due to a decrease in net loss  excluding non cash adjustments  of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  the decrease in net loss resulted from a million increase in revenues for oncotype dx  a million increase in revenue from pharmaceutical collaborators  and a million increase in interest income  partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  this increase of million was due to a decrease of million in short term investments offset by a million increase in cash used to acquire property  equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  amounts for represented million of net proceeds from our equipment loan and  of net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises 
amounts in the year ended december  included net proceeds from our initial public 
table of contents offering of million  proceeds from our private placement with incyte of million and net proceeds from our equipment loan of million 
off balance sheet activities as of december   we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual commitments payments due by period more less than than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands notes payable obligations operating lease obligations total in march  we entered into an arrangement to finance the acquisition of laboratory equipment  computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements and office equipment 
in connection with this arrangement  we granted the lender a security interest in the assets purchased with the borrowed amounts 
we could not prepay any amounts owed until april  at which point we could prepay all  but not part  of the amounts owing under the arrangement so long as we also pay a premium on the remaining payments 
this premium is reduced to in and in as of december   borrowings under this arrangement were million at an annual interest rate of       or  depending upon the applicable note 
as december   we leased approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space under a lease we entered into in september the lease has a term of six years 
as of december   we are required to make aggregate rent payments of  in   in   in   in and  in and thereafter  all of which are included in the table above 
in january  we executed an agreement to lease approximately  square feet of additional laboratory and office space near the location we currently occupy 
the lease has a term of six years 
under the new lease  we are required to make aggregate rent payments of  in   in   in   in and million in and thereafter  which are not included in the table above 
in addition to the above  we are required to make a series of annual payments under one of our collaboration agreements beginning on the date that we commercially launched oncotype dx 
the initial payment of  was made in january for a period of seven years on each anniversary of this first payment  we are required to make additional payments in increasing amounts 
payments of  and  were made in january and january  respectively 
we are required to make additional payments of  in and  in each of through however  either party may terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future and to make capital expenditures to keep pace with the expansion of our research and development programs and to scale up our commercial operations 
it may take several years to move any one of a number of product candidates in early development through the development phase and validation phase to commercialization 
we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund working capital and for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  such as licensing technology rights  partnering arrangements for our tests outside the united states or reduction of debt obligations 
we have spent approximately million through december  for facility expansion and improvements and are considering an additional approximately million in further facility improvements 

table of contents the amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as the progress of our product development  regulatory requirements  commercialization efforts  the amount of cash used by operations and progress in reimbursement 
we expect that we will receive limited payments for oncotype dx billings in the foreseeable future 
as reimbursement contracts with third party payors are put into place  we expect an increase in the number and level of payments received for oncotype dx billings 
we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with collections from oncotype dx and amounts available under our equipment credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our operations and facility expansion plans for at least the next months 
we cannot be certain that any of our reimbursement contract programs or development of future products will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional funds to see these programs through to a successful result 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  the cost of expanding our commercial and laboratory operations  including our selling and marketing efforts  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with expansion of oncotype dx for breast cancer  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with products in the research phase focused on cancers other than breast cancer  the cost of acquiring or achieving access to tissue samples and technologies  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the cost and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products  and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaborations  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter 
we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenues to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  borrowings or strategic collaborations 
the issuance of equity securities may result in dilution to stockholders  and debt financing may involve restrictive covenants 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives 
in addition  we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our product development programs or market development programs  which would lower the economic value of those programs to our company 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas this pronouncement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we plan to adopt fin as of january  and are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our investment portfolio 
our marketable securities consist of high quality debt securities with maturities beyond days at the date of acquisition  which mature within one year or less 
our long term investments consist of high quality debt securities with maturities beyond one year 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
our investment policy calls for investments in short term  low risk  investment grade instruments 
based on our portfolio content and our ability to hold investments to maturity  we believe that  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the decline in fair value would not be material
