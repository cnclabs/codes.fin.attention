brokerage we provide two principal categories of services within our brokerage operations i institutional brokerage  which comprises institutional sales  sales trading and trading  and ii private client services 
institutional brokerage 
we provide equity and convertible debt securities sales and trading services to more than institutional investors 
we have historically targeted the largest traditional institutional investor accounts  which generate the majority of our trading business 
more recently  we have also begun to target middle markets and smaller accounts 
institutional sales 
our institutional sales professionals provide equity and convertible debt securities sales services to institutional investors and seek to develop strong relationships with the portfolio managers they serve by developing target sector expertise and working closely with our equity research department 
our institutional sales professionals focus growth companies identified by our equity research department and seek to develop a thorough understanding of those companies

through our sales trading professionals  we connect with many large and active buy side trading desks in the united states and europe 
trading 
our trading professionals provide support to our institutional clients in their pursuit of best execution  including facilitating block trades  providing electronic trading services  committing capital and otherwise providing liquidity

we believe these non deal road shows underscore our high service approach  promote our brokerage services and are valued by our institutional brokerage

non deal road shows present an environment for investors to further their understanding of companies in which they have an equity position or that may be attractive investment opportunities and for company executives to broaden relationships with their investors and develop relationships with potential investors 
private client services 
our private client services department offers brokerage and advisory services to high net worth individuals and cash management services to corporate clients 
our private client professionals emphasize capital preservation and growth through prudent planning and work closely with clients to personalize solutions that address their individual needs 
research equity research 
our research analysts perform independent research to help our clients understand the dynamics that drive the sectors and companies they cover 
we seek to differentiate ourselves through originality of perspective  depth of insight and ability to uncover industry trends 
as of december   approximately of the companies covered by our us equity research professionals had market capitalizations of billion or less 
equity research by market capitalization as of december  pie chart 
table of contents the sectors and industry components we focus on within equity research are set forth in the table and chart below technology healthcare consumer hardware biopharmaceuticals financial products communications components biotechnology gaming lodging and communications equipment core healthcare information interactive market services wireless technology and lifestyles sports retailers communications equipment ip pharmaceutical services restaurants networking life science technology retailing hardlines electronic supply chain medical devices retailing softlines enterprise hardware pharmaceuticals specialty information financial technology services semiconductor capital equipment semiconductors broadline semiconductors specialty software services software applications communications software infrastructure media telecom internet services and publishing media broadcasting telecom services in addition  our equity research analysts publish research in other areas that we believe demonstrate potential for high growth  such as the industrial growth sector  which currently includes the following industry components applied technologies  defense security and alternative energy and environmental services 
equity research by sector based on number of companies covered as of december  pie chart our research analysts analyze major trends  publish research on new areas of growth  provide fundamental  company specific coverage and work with our institutional clients to identify and evaluate investment opportunities in publicly traded companies 
they periodically publish comprehensive white paper studies of an industry or a long term investment theme  provide analysis and commentary on growth companies in our target sectors and publish detailed primary research on investment opportunities in those sectors 
we annually host several conferences targeting growth companies and investors  including our technology conference  internet conference  healthcare conference and consumer conference 
we use these specialized events to showcase companies to institutional investors focused on investing in these 
table of contents growth sectors 
we believe that our conferences differentiate us from smaller investment banks that may lack the relationships and resources to host broadly attended industry events 
discovery research 
in addition to our equity research described above  we have developed and are currently marketing discovery research  a subscription based research product produced in our mumbai office 
discovery research focuses on the uncovered stocks in the growth sectors of the economy generally companies that are covered by fewer than three wall street research analysts 
asset management our asset management division is divided into three principal units i private equity  ii public equity and iii distribution management 
private equity 
we are currently the general partner of four groups of investment funds thomas weisel global growth partners is a fund of funds for private equity investments with a capital commitment of million and a fund for secondary private equity investments with a capital commitment of million 
these funds were formed in and  respectively 
as of december   the total amount that has been invested by these funds was million 
thomas weisel venture partners is a venture capital fund that invests in information technology companies  particularly in the broadly defined software and communications industries 
the fund was formed in with an original capital commitment of approximately million  million of which has been invested as of december  thomas weisel healthcare venture partners is a healthcare venture capital fund that invests in the emerging life sciences and medical technology sectors 
the fund was formed in with an original capital commitment of approximately million  million of which has been invested as of december  thomas weisel india opportunity fund is a fund of funds targeting venture capital and private equity funds primarily investing in growth businesses in india 
the fund was formed in with an original capital commitment of approximately million  million of which was been invested as of december  in the future we expect to continue to sponsor and raise follow on or new investment funds 
for certain of the funds for which we are a general partner we also act as manager of the fund and receive private equity management fees generally based on committed capital or net assets of the partnerships 
in certain investment partnerships we have elected to waive receipt of management fees in lieu of making direct cash capital contributions 
these waived management fees are treated as deemed contributions by us to the partnerships  satisfy the capital commitments to which we would otherwise be subject as general partner and are recognized in revenue when the investment partnership generates gains and allocates the gains to the general partner in respect of previously waived management fees 
because waived management fees are contingent upon the recognition of gains by the investment partnership  the recognition in revenue is deferred until the contingency is satisfied in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in we entered into an agreement with certain of our then current employees responsible for the management of thomas weisel healthcare venture partners lp  a venture fund investing in healthcare portfolio companies  under which these employees established a third party investment management company to provide management services to the fund 
under the agreement  we will retain our general partner interest  carried interest and capital account in the fund 
the third party investment management company will receive substantially all of the management fee revenues previously recorded by us as general partner of the fund 
we previously managed thomas weisel capital partners  lp and related funds  or twcp  which was formed in with original capital commitments of approximately billion 
from march to 
table of contents november  twcp was managed by our affiliate tailwind capital partners llc  or tailwind 
in november  we completed a transaction through which a new general partner  owned by the senior managers of twcp  assumed primary responsibility for the management of the twcp funds 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations revenues asset management revenue of this annual report on form k 
public equity 
during  as part of the expansion of our asset management business  we hired a new small mid cap growth equity investment team based in portland  oregon 
following the hiring of this team  we provided seed investment funds for the products they manage 
the new equity investment team manages these products through a new asset management subsidiary and collectively owns a minority equity stake in that subsidiary and receives other amounts that together total approximately of the profits generated 
the head of this team has been named the chief investment officer of our asset management business and in that capacity will oversee development of additional asset management products and receive additional compensation if specified revenue targets or other event milestones are achieved  which may be accelerated if there is a change in control with respect thomas weisel partners group  inc in addition  in we provided seed investment funds for a new asset management product to be invested in long and short positions in publicly traded equities and related options and other derivative instruments 
in the future  we expect to continue to expand our asset management business and provide additional seed investment funds for new asset management products 
distribution management 
distribution management actively manages securities distributions from private equity and venture capital funds 
we seek to enhance the returns realized by distributions made from private equity and venture capital funds 
the distribution management services we provide include dedicated portfolio management  execution  consolidated reporting and administrative support 
employees as of december   we had approximately employees 
our professionals draw upon their experience and market expertise to provide differentiated advice and customized services for our clients 
we believe our professionals are attracted to our firm by our specialized market focus  entrepreneurial culture and commitment to our clients 
none of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and believe our relationship with our employees to be good 
competition as an investment bank  all aspects of our business are intensely competitive 
our competitors are other brokerage firms  investment banking firms  merchant banks and financial advisory firms 
we compete with some of our competitors nationally or regionally and with others on a product or service basis 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital and resources than we do and offer a broader range of financial products 
we believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our business include client relationships  reputation  the abilities of our professionals  market focus and the relative quality and price of our services and products 
in recent years there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry 
legislative and regulatory changes in the united states have allowed commercial banks to enter businesses previously limited to investment banks  and a number of large commercial banks  insurance companies and other broad based financial services firms have established or acquired broker dealers or merged with other financial institutions 
this trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of many of our competitors 
many of our competitors have the ability to offer a wider range of products and services that may enhance their competitive position 
they may also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products and services with commercial banking  insurance and other financial 
table of contents services capabilities in an effort to gain market share  which could result in pricing pressure in our businesses 
we experience intense price competition with respect to our brokerage business  including large block trades  spreads and trading commissions 
the ability to execute trades electronically and through other alternative trading systems has increased the pricing pressure on trading commissions and spreads  as well as affected the volume of trades being executed through traditional full service platforms 
we believe that this trend toward alternative trading systems will continue 
we also experience price competition with respect to our investment banking business 
one trend  particularly in the equity underwriting business  toward multiple book runners and co managers has increased the competitive pressure in the investment banking industry  and may lead to lower average transaction fees 
we have also experienced competition with respect to our asset management business both in the pursuit of investors for our investment funds and products and in the identification and completion of investments in attractive portfolio companies for our investment funds 
we compete for individual and institutional clients on the basis of price  the range of products we offer  the quality of our services as well as on the basis of financial resources available to us and invested in our products 
we may be competing with other investors and corporate buyers for the investments that we make 
we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future  including if some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices 
competition is also intense for the recruitment and retention of qualified professionals 
our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our continued ability to attract new professionals and retain and motivate our existing professionals

the sec has adopted rule amendments that establish alternative net capital requirements for broker dealers that are part of a consolidated supervised entity

the usa patriot act of contains anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker dealers and other financial services companies  including standards for verifying client identification at account opening  and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities 
anti money laundering laws outside the united states contain some similar provisions 
the obligation of financial institutions  including us  to identify their customers  watch for and report suspicious transactions  respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies  and share information with other financial institutions  has required the implementation and maintenance of internal practices  procedures and controls which have increased  and may continue to increase  our costs  and any failure with respect to our programs in this area could subject us to regulatory consequences  including substantial fines and potentially other liabilities

item a 
risk factors we face a variety of risks in our business  many of which are substantial and inherent in our business and operations 
the following are some of the important risk factors that could affect our business  our industry and holders of our common stock 
these risks are not exhaustive 
other sections of this annual report on form k may include additional factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 

table of contents risks related to our business we focus principally on specific sectors of the economy  and a deterioration in the business environment in these sectors generally or decline in the market for securities of companies within these sectors could materially adversely affect our businesses 
we focus principally on the technology  healthcare and consumer sectors of the economy 
therefore  volatility in the business environment in these sectors generally  or in the market for securities of companies within these sectors particularly  could substantially affect our financial results and the market value of our common stock 
the business environment for companies in these sectors has experienced substantial volatility since we were formed  and our financial results have consequently been subject to significant variations from year to year 
the market for securities in each of our target sectors may also be subject to industry specific risks 
for example  changes in policies by the united states food and drug administration may affect the market for securities of biotechnology and healthcare companies 
underwriting transactions  strategic advisory engagements and related trading activities in our target sectors represent a significant portion of our businesses 
this concentration exposes us to the risk of substantial declines in revenues in the event of downturns in these sectors of the economy 
for example  during the period from january  to december   the nasdaq composite index fell from  to  the dollar volume of ipos by technology companies dropped from billion in to billion in and the dollar volume of mergers and acquisitions involving technology companies declined from billion in to billion in our revenues during the same period declined from a peak of million in to million in any future downturns in our target sectors could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our financial results may fluctuate substantially from period to period  which may impair our stock price 
we have experienced  and expect to experience in the future  significant periodic variations in our revenues and results of operations 
these variations may be attributed in part to the fact that our investment banking revenues are typically earned upon the successful completion of a transaction  the timing of which is uncertain and beyond our control 
in most cases we receive little or no payment for investment banking engagements that do not result in the successful completion of a transaction 
as a result  our business is highly dependent on market conditions as well as the decisions and actions of our clients and interested third parties 
for example  a client s acquisition transaction may be delayed or terminated because of a failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  failure to obtain necessary regulatory consents or board or shareholder approvals  failure to secure necessary financing  adverse market conditions or unexpected financial or other problems in the client s or counterparty s business 
if the parties fail to complete a transaction on which we are advising or an offering in which we are participating  we will earn little or no revenue from the transaction 
this risk may be intensified by our focus on growth companies in the technology  healthcare and consumer sectors  as the market for securities of these companies has experienced significant variations in the number and size of equity offerings 
recently  more companies initiating the process of an initial public offering are simultaneously exploring merger and acquisition opportunities 
if we are not engaged as a strategic advisor in any such dual tracked process  our investment banking revenues would be adversely affected in the event that an initial public offering is not consummated 
in addition  our investments are adjusted to fair value in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles at the end of each quarter and our allocable share of the gains or losses will affect our revenues  which could increase the volatility of our quarterly earnings 
as a result  we are unlikely to achieve steady and predictable earnings on a quarterly basis  which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

table of contents our ability to retain our professionals and recruit additional professionals is critical to the success of our business  and our failure to do so may materially adversely affect our reputation  business and results of operations 
our ability to obtain and successfully execute our business depends upon the personal reputation  judgment  business generation capabilities and project execution skills of our senior professionals  particularly thomas w 
weisel  our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  and the other members of our executive committee 
our senior professionals personal reputations and relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and executing client engagements 
we encounter intense competition for qualified employees from other companies in the investment banking industry as well as from businesses outside the investment banking industry  such as investment advisory firms  hedge funds  private equity funds and venture capital funds 
from time to time  we have experienced losses of investment banking  brokerage  research and other professionals and losses of our key personnel may occur in the future 
the departure or other loss of mr 
weisel  any other member of our executive committee or any other senior professional who manages substantial client relationships and possesses substantial experience and expertise  could impair our ability to secure or successfully complete engagements  protect our market share or retain assets under management  each of which  in turn  could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in connection with our initial public offering and our conversion to corporate form  many of our professionals received substantial amounts of common stock in exchange for their membership interests 
ownership of  and the ability to realize equity value from  our common stock  unlike that of membership interests in thomas weisel partners group llc the predecessor to thomas weisel partners group  inc  does not depend upon continued employment and our professionals are not restricted from leaving us by the potential loss of the value of their ownership interests 
these shares of common stock are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and a portion are pledged to secure liquidated damages obligations to us as set forth in the partners equity agreement  which has been filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form k 
however  these agreements will survive for only a limited period and will permit any professional that is party thereto to leave us without losing any of their shares of common stock if they comply with these agreements and  in some cases  compliance with these agreements may also be waived 
consequently  the steps we have taken to encourage the continued service of these individuals after our initial public offering may not be effective 
if any of our professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company  some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 
the compensation arrangements  non competition agreements and lock up agreements we have entered into with certain of our professionals may not prove effective in preventing them from resigning to join our competitors and the non competition agreements may not be upheld if we were to seek to enforce our rights under these agreements 
if we are unable to retain our professionals or recruit additional professionals  our reputation  business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
our adherence to an internal policy governing compensation and benefits expense may hinder our ability to retain our professionals and recruit additional professionals 
in connection with our initial public offering we announced that we intended to target aggregate annual compensation and benefits expense excluding expenses relating to equity awards made in connection with our initial public offering within the range of to of annual net revenues excluding investment gains and losses attributable to investments in partnerships and other securities 
in we complied with this policy  with compensation and benefits expense excluding expenses relating to equity awards made in connection with our initial public offering equaling approximately of annual net revenues excluding investment gains and losses attributable to investments in partnerships and other securities 
however  in we granted equity awards as part of our compensation and hiring process  the full expense of which was not recognized in and which instead will be recognized in accordance with gaap pro rata over a four year vesting period 
the future expense 
table of contents associated with these grants will impact our ability to continue to comply with our to policy in and subsequent years 
in we again intend to target aggregate annual compensation and benefits expense excluding expenses relating to equity awards made in connection with our initial public offering within the range of to of annual net revenues excluding investment gains and losses attributable to investments in partnerships and other securities  although we retain the ability to change this rate in or thereafter 
we may decide to alter or discontinue our policy of targeting annual compensation and benefits expense within a specific band of net revenues due to i the impact that equity awards granted in prior periods which result in compensation expense in periods subsequent to the grant thereof  ii the fact that new business initiatives or efforts to expand existing businesses generally require us to incur compensation and benefits expense prior to realizing any additional revenues or iii other factors or competitive pressures 
in we have granted and will continue to grant equity awards as part of our compensation and hiring process  the full expense of which will not be recognized in and which instead will be recognized in accordance with gaap pro rata over a four year vesting period 
the future expenses associated with these grants will impact our ability to continue to comply with our to policy in and subsequent years 
in we granted equity awards that will be expensed pro rata over their three or four year vesting period 
as of december   there were  restricted stock units outstanding with an aggregate grant date fair value of million 
of these shares   were made in connection with our initial public offering and have a three year vesting period 
on february   we made an additional grant of  restricted stock units as part of our regular compensation process with an aggregate grant date fair value of million and a four year vesting period 
overall  as of march   there were  restricted stock units outstanding  of which  were vested and  were unvested 
to the extent we continue to have annual compensation and benefits expense targets  we may not be able to retain our professionals or recruit additional professionals at compensation levels that are within our target range for compensation and benefits expense 
pricing and other competitive pressures may impair the revenues and profitability of our brokerage business 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our brokerage business 
along with other brokerage firms  we have experienced intense price competition in this business in recent years 
in particular  the ability to execute trades electronically and through other alternative trading systems has increased the pressure on trading commissions  volume and spreads 
we expect this trend toward alternative trading systems to continue 
we believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price 
in addition  we face pressure from our larger competitors  which may be better able to offer a broader range of complementary products and services to brokerage clients in order to win their trading business 
as we are committed to maintaining our comprehensive research coverage in our target sectors to support our brokerage business  we may be required to make substantial investments in our research capabilities 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors in these areas  brokerage revenues may decline and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
changes in laws and regulations governing brokerage and research activities could also adversely affect our brokerage business 
in july  the sec published interpretive guidance regarding the scope of permitted brokerage and research services in connection with soft dollar practices ie  arrangements under which an investment adviser directs client brokerage transactions to a broker in exchange for research products or services in addition to brokerage services and solicited further public comment regarding soft dollar practices involving third party providers of research 
the july sec interpretive guidance may affect our 
table of contents brokerage business and laws or regulations may prompt brokerage customers to revisit or alter the manner in which they pay for research or brokerage services 
we and firms that compete with us have or may put in place commission sharing arrangements under which an institutional client will execute trades with a limited number of brokers and instruct those brokers to allocate a portion of the commissions generated directly to other broker dealers or to independent research providers in exchange for research and other permissible products and services 
as such arrangements are entered into by our clients with us and or other brokerage firms  it may further increase the competitive pressures within the brokerage business and or reduce the value our clients place on high quality research 
in the sec promulgated regulation nms  which made dramatic changes to the national market system  and one of the most significant of those changes  the order protection rule recently became effective 
under the order protection rule  commonly known as the trade through rule  broker dealers that trade at a price higher than the inside offer or lower than the inside bid of a market center s best quotation will be required to take out  or execute against  that market s quotation 
we cannot fully predict the effect that the implementation of the order protection rule may have on our brokerage business 
fidelity management research company  one of our largest institutional brokerage clients in terms of commission revenue  has entered into arrangements with some brokerage firms under which fidelity will separate payments for research products or services from trading commissions for brokerage services and will pay for research directly in cash  instead of compensating these firms through trading commissions as under soft dollar practices 
in march we entered into such an agreement with fidelity 
since entering into this agreement  our brokerage revenues from fidelity have materially decreased in compared to difficult market conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways 
difficult market and economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business and profitability in many ways 
weakness in equity markets and diminished trading volume of securities could adversely impact our brokerage business  from which we have historically generated more than half of our net revenues and from which we generated approximately of our net revenues in industry wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions also would likely have an adverse effect on our revenues 
in addition  reductions in the trading prices for equity securities also tend to reduce the deal value of investment banking transactions  such as underwriting and mergers and acquisitions transactions  which in turn may reduce the fees we earn from these transactions 
also  difficult market conditions would likely decrease the value of assets under management in our asset management and private client business  which would decrease the amount of asset based fees we receive  and may also affect our ability to attract additional or retain existing assets under management within these businesses 
as we may be unable to reduce expenses correspondingly  our profits and profit margins may decline 
as an investment bank focused principally on the growth sectors of the economy  we depend significantly on transactions by venture capital backed companies for sources of revenues and potential business opportunities 
to the extent venture capital investment activities slow down in general or in our target sectors due to difficult market conditions or otherwise  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  as we are headquartered in california and a substantial percentage of our growth company clients are located in california  a natural disaster or a regional economic downturn in california could harm our businesses even when the market conditions elsewhere are not affected 
adverse market or economic conditions or a slowdown of activity in the sectors in which the portfolio companies of our private equity funds operate could have an adverse effect on the earnings of those portfolio companies  and therefore  our earnings 

table of contents we face strong competition from larger firms 
the brokerage  investment banking and asset management industries are intensely competitive and we expect them to remain so 
we compete on the basis of a number of factors  including client relationships  reputation  the abilities and past performance of our professionals  market focus and the relative quality and price of our services and products 
we have experienced intense price competition with respect to our brokerage business  including large block trades  spreads and trading commissions 
pricing and other competitive pressures in investment banking  including the trends toward multiple book runners  co managers and multiple financial advisors handling transactions  have continued and could adversely affect our revenues  even during periods where the volume and number of investment banking transactions are increasing 
competitive factors with respect to our asset management activities include the amount of firm capital we can invest in new products and our ability to increase assets under management  including our ability to attract capital for new investment funds 
we believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price 
we are a relatively small investment bank with approximately employees as of december  and net revenues of million in many of our competitors in the brokerage  investment banking and asset management industries have a broader range of products and services  greater financial and marketing resources  larger customer bases  greater name recognition  more senior professionals to serve their clients needs  greater global reach and more established relationships with clients than we have 
these larger and better capitalized competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the brokerage  investment banking and asset management industries  to compete for skilled professionals  to finance acquisitions  to fund internal growth and to compete for market share generally 
the scale of our competitors has increased in recent years as a result of substantial consolidation among companies in the brokerage and investment banking industries 
in addition  a number of large commercial banks  insurance companies and other broad based financial services firms have established or acquired underwriting or financial advisory practices and broker dealers or have merged with other financial institutions 
these firms have the ability to offer a wider range of products than we do  which may enhance their competitive position 
they also have the ability to support investment banking with commercial banking  insurance and other financial services in an effort to gain market share  which has resulted  and could further result  in pricing pressure in our businesses 
in particular  the ability to provide financing has become an important advantage for some of our larger competitors and  because we do not provide such financing  we may be unable to compete as effectively for clients in a significant part of the brokerage and investment banking market 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we have incurred losses in the recent past and may incur losses in the future 
we have incurred losses in the recent past 
we recorded net losses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we also recorded net losses in certain quarters within other past fiscal years 
we may incur losses in any of our future periods 
if we are unable to finance future losses  those losses may have a significant effect on our liquidity as well as our ability to operate 
in addition  we may incur significant expenses in connection with initiating new business activities or in connection with any expansion of our underwriting  brokerage or asset management businesses 
we may also engage in strategic acquisitions and investments for which we may incur significant expenses 
accordingly  we will need to increase our revenues at a rate greater than our expenses to achieve and maintain profitability 
if our revenues do not increase sufficiently  or even if our revenues increase but we are unable to manage our expenses  we will not achieve and maintain profitability in future periods 

table of contents our capital markets and strategic advisory engagements are singular in nature and do not generally provide for subsequent engagements 
our strategy is to take a lifecycle approach in providing investment banking services to our clients  however  our investment banking clients generally retain us on a short term  engagement by engagement basis in connection with specific capital markets or mergers and acquisitions transactions  rather than on a recurring basis under long term contracts 
as these transactions are typically singular in nature and our engagements with these clients may not recur  we must seek out new engagements when our current engagements are successfully completed or are terminated 
as a result  high activity levels in any period are not necessarily indicative of continued high levels of activity in any subsequent period 
if we are unable to generate a substantial number of new engagements and generate fees from those successful completion of transactions  our business and results of operations would likely be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our brokerage revenues are generated from a relatively small number of institutional clients 
a significant portion of our brokerage revenues are generated from a relatively small number of institutional clients 
for example  in we generated of our brokerage revenues  or approximately of our net revenues  from our ten largest brokerage clients 
similarly  in we generated of our brokerage revenues  or approximately of our net revenues  from our ten largest brokerage clients 
if any of our key clients departs or reduces its business with us and we fail to attract new clients that are capable of generating significant trading volumes  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
poor investment performance  pricing pressure and other competitive factors may reduce our asset management revenues or result in losses 
as part of our strategy  we are investing in the expansion of our asset management business 
our revenues from this business are primarily derived from management fees which are based on committed capital and or assets under management and incentive fees  which are earned if the return of our investment funds exceeds certain threshold returns 
our ability to maintain or increase assets under management is subject to a number of factors  including investors perception of our past performance  market or economic conditions  competition from other fund managers and our ability to negotiate terms with major investors 
investment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing clients and competing for new asset management and private equity business and our historical performance may not be indicative of future results 
poor investment performance and other competitive factors could reduce our revenues and impair our growth in many ways existing clients may withdraw funds from our asset management business in favor of better performing products  our incentive fees could decline or be eliminated entirely  firms with which we have business relationships may terminate these relationships with us  our capital investments in our investment funds or the seed capital we have committed to new asset management products may diminish in value or may be lost  and our key employees in the business may depart  whether to join a competitor or otherwise 
our investment funds include gains and losses that have not yet been realized through sales or other transactions 
the ultimate realization of these gains and losses will depend on whether these funds achieve satisfactory investment performance 
these unrealized gains and losses are recognized in our results of operations because these investments are accounted for in accordance with gaap using the fair value method based on the percentage interest in the underlying partnerships 
the underlying investments held by such partnerships are valued based on quoted market prices  or estimated fair value 
table of contents if there is no public market 
due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation  fair values of these non marketable investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments  which differences could be material  and these differences may result in increased volatility in our asset management revenues 
to the extent our future investment performance is perceived to be poor in either relative or absolute terms  our asset management revenues will likely be reduced and our ability to raise new funds will likely be impaired 
even when market conditions are generally favorable  our investment performance may be adversely affected by our investment style and the particular investments that we make 
in addition  over the past several years  the size and number of investment funds  including exchange traded funds  hedge funds and private equity funds  has continued to increase 
if this trend continues  it is possible that it will become increasingly difficult for us to raise capital for new investment funds or price competition may mean that we are unable to maintain our current fee structure 
we have historically competed primarily on the performance of our investment funds and other asset management products and services  and not on the level of our fees relative to those of our competitors 
however  there is a risk that fees in the asset management industry will decline  without regard to the historical performance of a manager  including our historical performance 
fee reductions on our existing or future investment funds and other asset management products and services  without corresponding decreases in our cost structure  would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
increases in capital commitments in our trading  underwriting and other businesses increases the potential for significant losses 
the trend in capital markets is toward larger and more frequent commitments of capital by financial services firms in many of their activities 
for example  in order to win business  investment banks are increasingly committing capital to purchase large blocks of stock from publicly traded issuers or their significant shareholders  instead of the more traditional marketed underwriting process  in which marketing was typically completed before an investment bank committed capital to purchase securities for resale 
we have participated in this trend and expect to continue to do so 
as a result  we will be subject to increased risk as we commit greater amounts of capital to facilitate primarily client driven business 
furthermore  we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry 
we may enter into large transactions in which we commit our own capital as part of our trading business 
the number and size of these large transactions may materially affect our results of operations in a given period 
we may also incur significant losses from our trading activities due to market fluctuations and volatility from quarter to quarter 
we maintain trading positions in the fixed income and equity markets to facilitate client trading activities and at times these positions can be large and concentrated in a single issuer 
to the extent that we own assets  ie  have long positions  a downturn in the value of those assets or in those markets could result in losses 
conversely  to the extent that we have sold assets we do not own  ie  have short positions  an upturn in those markets could expose us to potentially unlimited losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market 
we also commit capital to investment funds we sponsor and utilize our own funds as seed capital for new products and services in our asset management business 
these investments may diminish in value or may be lost entirely if market conditions are not favorable 
limitations on our access to capital could impair our liquidity and our ability to conduct our businesses 
liquidity  or ready access to funds  is essential to financial services firms 
failures of financial institutions have often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity 
liquidity is of particular importance to our trading business and perceived liquidity issues may affect our clients and counterparties willingness to engage in brokerage transactions with us 
our liquidity could be impaired due to 
table of contents circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading clients  third parties or us 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time 
our private equity business may also create liquidity risk due to increased levels of investments in high risk  illiquid assets 
we have made substantial principal investments in our private equity funds and may make additional investments in future funds  which are typically made in securities that are not publicly traded 
there is a significant risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy 
in particular  these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made  changes in national or international economic conditions or changes in laws  regulations  fiscal policies or political conditions of countries in which investments are made 
it takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of our investments through resale 
even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable  it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash 
thomas weisel partners llc  our broker dealer subsidiary  is subject to the net capital requirements of the sec and various self regulatory organizations of which it is a member 
these requirements typically specify the minimum level of net capital a broker dealer must maintain and also mandate that a significant part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form 
any failure to comply with these net capital requirements could impair our ability to conduct our core business as a brokerage firm 
furthermore  thomas weisel partners llc is subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from it to thomas weisel partners group  inc as a holding company  thomas weisel partners group  inc depends on distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund all payments on its obligations  including debt obligations 
as a result  regulatory actions could impede access to funds that thomas weisel partners group  inc needs to make payments on obligations  including debt obligations 
our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk 
our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk 
we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money  securities or other assets will not perform their obligations 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure  breach of contract or other reasons 
we are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances 
as a clearing member firm  we finance our customer positions and could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers 
although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee 
in addition  concerns about  or a default by  one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems  losses or defaults by other institutions  which in turn could adversely affect us 
also  risk management policies and procedures that we utilize with respect to investing our own funds or committing our capital with respect to investment banking  trading activities or asset management activities may not protect us or mitigate our risks from those activities 
if any of the variety of instruments  processes and strategies we utilize to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective  we may incur losses 

table of contents in connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the nine months ended september   our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal controls  and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
in connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the nine months ended september   our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal controls  as defined in the standards established by the american institute of certified public accountants 
the material weakness identified for the year ended december  related to an improper application of us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  to certain employment contracts that we entered into with our employees 
the material weakness identified for the nine months ended september  related to our closing and reporting process for valuing certain investments in partnerships 
the occurrence of these material weaknesses may indicate a heightened risk that a material misstatement in our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected or that a material weakness will occur or be identified in the future 
in addition  additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be identified in the future 
as a recently public company  section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules of the sec will require our management to conduct annual assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and will require a report by our independent registered public accounting firm relating to our internal controls  beginning with the fiscal year ending december  during the course of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section  we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of for compliance with the requirements of section in addition  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting  as these standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section if we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment  we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations  which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
this could harm our operating results and lead to a decline in our stock price 
additionally  ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the nasdaq stock market  regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions 
our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of increasingly complex transactions across diverse markets 
our financial  accounting or other data processing systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity  financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
we also face the risk of operational failure of any of our clearing agents  the exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions 
any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and to manage our exposure to risk 
in addition  provisions of the sec s regulation nms  including the order protection rule which recently became effective  require operational and systems changes to our and our clearing brokers 
table of contents systems in order to comply with the provisions 
if the implementation of these changes results in operational failures or disruptions  it could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and impact our results of operations 
in addition  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business  whether due to fire  other natural disaster  power or communications failure  act of terrorism or war or otherwise 
nearly all of our employees in our primary locations  including san francisco  new york  boston and mumbai  work in close proximity to each other 
if a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations  our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer and we may not be able to implement successfully contingency plans that depend on communication or travel 
insurance policies to mitigate these risks may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit 
further  any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain of these risks may not cover our loss 
our operations also rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our  our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
strategic investments or acquisitions and joint ventures may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business 
we intend to grow our business through both internal expansion and through strategic investments  acquisitions or joint ventures 
to the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures  we face numerous risks and uncertainties combining or integrating businesses  including integrating relationships with customers  business partners and internal data processing systems 
in the case of joint ventures  we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon  and subject to liability  losses or reputational damage relating to  systems  controls and personnel that are not under our control 
in addition  conflicts or disagreements between us and our joint venture partners may negatively impact our businesses 
future acquisitions or joint ventures by us could entail a number of risks  including problems with the effective integration of operations  the inability to maintain key pre acquisition business relationships and integrate new relationships  the inability to retain key employees  increased operating costs  exposure to unanticipated liabilities  risks of misconduct by employees not subject to our control  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings  and exposure to new or unknown liabilities 
any future growth of our business may require significant resources and or result in significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities 
in addition  expansions  acquisitions or joint ventures may require significant managerial attention  which may be diverted from our other operations 
our international activities are subject to political  economic  legal  operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in a foreign country 
in we plan to further enhance our research capabilities and engage in other business initiatives through our office in mumbai  india 
in connection with our business activities in india  and to the 
table of contents extent that we pursue other business opportunities outside the united states  we will be subject to political  economic  legal  operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in a foreign country  including risks of possible nationalization  expropriation  price controls  capital controls  exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions  as well as the outbreak of hostilities 
in many countries  the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving  and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market 
our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular foreign market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 
we are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions 
evaluation of our prospects may be more difficult in light of our limited operating history 
our company was formed in and we have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business and prospects 
as a relatively young enterprise  we are subject to the risks and uncertainties that face a company during its formative development 
some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to attract and retain clients on a cost effective basis  expand and enhance our service offerings  raise additional capital and respond to competitive market conditions 
we may not be able to address these risks adequately  and our failure to do so may adversely affect our business and the value of an investment in our common stock 
risks related to our industry risks associated with regulatory impact on capital markets 
highly publicized financial scandals in recent years have led to investor concerns over the integrity of the us financial markets  and have prompted congress  the sec  the nyse and nasdaq to significantly expand corporate governance and public disclosure requirements 
to the extent that private companies  in order to avoid becoming subject to these new requirements  decide to forgo initial public offerings  our equity underwriting business may be adversely affected 
in addition  provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and the corporate governance rules imposed by self regulatory organizations have diverted many companies attention away from capital market transactions  including securities offerings and acquisition and disposition transactions 
in particular  companies that are or are planning to be public are incurring significant expenses in complying with the sec and accounting standards relating to internal control over financial reporting  and companies that disclose material weaknesses in such controls under the new standards may have greater difficulty accessing the capital markets 
these factors  in addition to adopted or proposed accounting and disclosure changes  may have an adverse effect on our business 
financial services firms have been subject to increased scrutiny over the last several years  increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions 
firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment 
the industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators  including the sec  the nyse  the nasd and state attorneys general 
penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years 
this regulatory and enforcement environment has created uncertainty with respect to a number of transactions that had historically been entered into by financial services firms and that were generally believed to be permissible and appropriate 
we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self regulatory organizations 
we also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec  other united states or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets 
among other things  we could be fined  prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or subject to 
table of contents limitations or conditions on our business activities 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us  which could seriously harm our business prospects 
in addition  financial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts 
the sec and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest 
we have adopted various policies  controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts and regularly seek to review and update our policies  controls and procedures 
however  appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest 
our policies and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts may also result in increased costs  additional operational personnel and increased regulatory risk 
failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions or client litigation 
for example  the research areas of investment banks have been and remain the subject of heightened regulatory scrutiny which has led to increased restrictions on the interaction between equity research analysts and investment banking personnel at securities firms 
several securities firms in the united states  including our wholly owned broker dealer subsidiary  reached a global settlement in and with certain federal and state securities regulators and self regulatory organizations to resolve investigations into equity research analysts alleged conflicts of interest 
under this settlement  the firms have been subject to certain restrictions and undertakings  which have imposed additional costs and limitations on the conduct of our businesses 
potential civil lawsuits implicating investment research analysts conflicts of interest were not settled as part of the global settlement 
the global settlements also did not resolve potential charges involving individual employees  including supervisors  and regulatory investigations are continuing 
our total potential liability in respect of such civil cases cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material to our results of operations 
financial service companies have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries concerning market timing  late trading and other activities that focus on the mutual fund industry 
these inquiries have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds  investment advisers and broker dealers 
although we do not act as an investment adviser to mutual funds  the regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in an increase in operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our business  and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities 
our exposure to legal liability is significant  and damages that we may be required to pay and the reputational harm that could result from legal action against us could materially adversely affect our businesses 
we face significant legal risks in our businesses and  in recent years  the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have been increasing 
these risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions  potential liability for fairness opinions and other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions and disputes over the terms and conditions of complex trading arrangements 
we are also subject to claims arising from disputes with employees for alleged discrimination or harassment  among other things 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
our role as advisor to our clients on important underwriting or mergers and acquisitions transactions involves complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment  including rendering fairness opinions in connection with mergers and other transactions 
therefore  our activities may subject us to the risk of significant legal liabilities to our clients and aggrieved third parties  including shareholders of our clients who could bring securities class actions against us 
our investment banking engagements typically include broad indemnities from our clients and provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services  but these provisions may not protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases 

table of contents for example  an indemnity from a client that subsequently is placed into bankruptcy is likely to be of little value to us in limiting our exposure to claims relating to that client 
as a result  we may incur significant legal and other expenses in defending against litigation and may be required to pay substantial damages for settlements and adverse judgments 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us  which could seriously harm our business and prospects 
employee misconduct could harm us and is difficult to detect and deter 
there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years  and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur at our company 
for example  misconduct by employees could involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases  and we may suffer significant reputational harm for any misconduct by our employees 
risks related to ownership of our common stock a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock is owned or controlled by our senior professionals and other employees and their interests may differ from those of other shareholders

overview we are an investment bank focused principally on the technology  healthcare and consumer sectors of the economy  which we refer to as our target sectors 
we were founded in and initially capitalized through investments from our founding partners and more than venture capital and private equity firms 
on february   thomas weisel partners group  inc succeeded to the business of thomas weisel partners group llc and completed an initial public offering of its common stock 
our business is managed as a single operating segment and we generate revenues by providing financial services that include investment banking  brokerage  research and asset management 
we take a comprehensive approach in providing these services to growth companies in our target sectors 
we are exposed to volatility and trends in the general securities market and the economy and we are specifically exposed to volatility and trends in our target sectors 
since our firm was founded in  the us economy in general  and our target sectors in particular  have experienced periods of expansion and contraction  as well as periods of uncertainty and cautious optimism 
notwithstanding this exposure to volatility and trends in our target sectors  in order to provide value to our clients  we have made a long term commitment to maintaining a substantial  full service integrated business platform 
during  we executed on the following initiatives initial public and follow on offerings 
in february  we completed our initial public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock and raised million in net proceeds 
in may we completed a follow on public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock and raised million in net proceeds 
the proceeds of the initial public offering and the follow on public offering have and will be used by us for general corporate purposes  strategic acquisitions and investment in new and existing products and services 
established office in mumbai  india 
in march we opened our mumbai  india office  where we have research analysts covering us small cap companies within our target sectors 
in our research analysts based in mumbai launched discovery research  our new subscription based research product targeting us investors by covering growth companies with a mean market capitalization of million and financial metrics meeting additional selection criteria 
we believe that providing research in india allows us to leverage the qualified and low cost research professionals available in india 
at the end of we had publishing research analysts covering us companies 
we currently plan to grow to discovery research publishing analysts covering more than companies by the end of expand brokerage product offerings convertible debt trading  middle market client sales and trading and electronic trading 
convertible debt trading 
throughout we expanded our convertible debt trading services by i using proceeds raised in our initial public offering and follow on offering to contribute capital to thomas weisel partners llc  our broker dealer subsidiary  allowing us to expand our convertible debt trading activities  ii hiring a senior professional to lead the expansion  and iii hiring analysts in india that are focused on the development of convertible debt trading strategies 
we believe that an expanded convertible debt trading platform will allow us to further support our integrated 
table of contents business model within our target sectors and provide for an additional sales channel for our brokerage services 
middle market client sales and trading 
in march we expanded our institutional client focus on middle markets a sub set of our institutional clients 
we now cover approximately middle market accounts with dedicated sales and trading professionals 
by expanding our focus on middle markets we believe that we have accessed a brokerage sales channel for our sales and trading professionals that does not generally require significant commitment of our own capital to facilitate client trading activity 
electronic trading 
in september we hired senior professionals to expand our electronic trading platform with the intention of increasing our market share of the expanding volume of shares traded by institutional clients through alternative trading platforms 
expand asset management product offerings small and mid cap investment product and india fund of funds 
small and mid cap investment product 
in october we hired a new small mid cap growth equity asset management team based in portland  oregon 
the small mid cap investment products developed by this team are managed through a new asset management subsidiary initially capitalized by us and with respect to which the team collectively owns a minority equity stake 
in addition  kenneth korngiebel  who heads this team  has been named the chief investment officer of our asset management business and in that capacity will oversee development of additional asset management products 
india fund of funds 
in  we sponsored a growth oriented private equity fund of funds  thomas weisel india opportunity fund  lp the fund s objective is to provide investors with access to venture capital and private equity funds in india 
we plan to continue to support and expand our sponsored private equity funds in we believe that by sponsoring our own private equity funds we may establish additional relationships with venture capital investors and venture stage growth companies and leverage our industry and private equity expertise to generate revenue in the form of management fees and capital gains 
private equity funds 
in we recognized an increase in capital gains including both realized and unrealized associated with our private equity funds  recording capital gains of million compared to million in this increase was partially a result of our recognition of carried interest capital gains in certain sponsored private equity funds 
an important component of our asset management revenues are realized and unrealized capital gains and losses associated with our private equity funds 
these gains and losses may be attributable to our capital account balances in these funds  to waived management fees or to the incentive fees commonly referred to as carried interest we may earn as a result of the performance of these funds

as a result  during the three months ended march   we recognized a one time net deferred tax benefit of million in connection with the establishment of a deferred tax asset balance of million  partially offset by a valuation allowance 
we made an initial grant to a broad group of our employees and advisors and each of our independent directors of restricted stock units with respect to which shares of common stock will be deliverable 
with respect to these grants  beginning with the three months ended march   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

for the period from february   the date the vesting period began for 
table of contents these restricted stock units  through december   we recorded million of non cash compensation expense in respect of these restricted stock units  which  after giving effect to our applicable federal and state tax rate of  results in an after tax non cash expense of million 
also as a result of our conversion from a limited liability company to a corporation  we became subject to federal and state income taxes as of february  in addition to reporting our net income and earnings per share for  we also report in the table below our net income and earnings per share for on a non gaap operating basis by excluding the effect of recognizing during the three months ended march  the million one time net deferred tax benefit but not excluding subsequent adjustments to the related valuation allowance  excluding the after tax non cash expense associated with our initial grant of restricted stock units of million in  and including additional income tax expense of million during the three months ended march   because we estimate that we would have incurred additional income tax expense for the period from january  to february  equal to our net income for that period of million multiplied by our applicable federal and state tax rate for the three months ended march  of 
in the future we do not expect that a similar conversion related deferred tax benefit will arise and we expect to be subject to federal and state income tax  in each case  because we do not expect to change our corporate form again 
also  although we expect to grant restricted stock units and other share based compensation in the future  we do not expect to make any such substantial grants outside of our regular compensation and hiring process  as we did when we granted the initial grant of restricted stock units in connection with our initial public offering 
our management has utilized a non gaap calculation of net income and earnings per share that are adjusted  as described above  to exclude the effect of recording the net deferred tax benefit during the three months ended march   include additional income tax expense and exclude the expense associated with our initial grant of restricted stock units  to aid in understanding and analyzing our financial results in our management believes that these non gaap measures will allow for a better evaluation of the operating performance of our business and facilitate meaningful comparison of our results in the current period to those in prior periods and future periods that did not and likely will not include the adjusted items 
our reference to these measures should not  however  be considered as a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with gaap 
these non gaap measures are provided to enhance investors overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future 
specifically  our management believes that the non gaap measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook 
a limitation of utilizing these non gaap measures of net income and earnings per share is that the gaap accounting effects of these events do in fact reflect the underlying financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing our financial results 
therefore  management believes that both our gaap measures of net income and earnings per share and these non gaap measures of our financial performance should be considered together

results of operations our results of operations depend on a number of market factors  including market conditions and valuations for companies in the technology  healthcare and consumer sectors  as well as general securities market conditions 
trends in the securities markets are also affected by general economic trends  including fluctuations in interest rates  flows of funds into and out of the markets and other conditions 
in addition to these market factors  our revenues from period to period are substantially affected by the timing of transactions in which we are involved 
fees for many of the services we provide are earned only upon the completion of a transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations in any individual year or quarter may be affected significantly by whether and when significant transactions are completed

investment banking revenue our investment banking revenues include i management fees  underwriting fees  selling concessions and agency placement fees earned through our participation in public offerings and private placements of equity and convertible debt securities and ii fees earned as strategic advisor in mergers and acquisitions and similar transactions 
investment banking revenues are typically recognized at the completion of each transaction 
although we take a lifecycle approach  investment banking engagements usually relate to only one potential transaction and do not provide us with long term contracted sources of revenue 
as a result  our investment banking revenues have and likely will continue to vary significantly between periods 
underwriting revenues are presented net of related expenses

particularly for our senior professionals  these bonuses make up a large portion of total compensation 
we accrue for the estimated amount of payments under this bonus plan over the applicable service period 
we generally pay bonuses at selected times and intend to make these payments in february and july 
equity awards constitute a portion of our compensation expense and are issued in conjunction with our discretionary bonus plan 
these equity awards will vest over a four year service period  except for the equity awards issued in connection with our initial public offering which vest over a three year period  subject to continued employment and  accordingly  the non cash compensation expense associated with these awards will be accrued ratably over the service period  which will begin at the date of grant 
in we intend to continue to target aggregate annual compensation and benefits expense excluding expenses relating to equity awards made in connection with our initial public offering within the range of and of annual net revenues excluding investment gains and losses attributable to investments in partnerships and other securities  although we retain the ability to change this rate in the future 
new business initiatives or efforts to expand existing businesses  may require that we incur compensation and benefits expense that exceeds our target range either on a permanent basis or temporarily as 
table of contents we incur compensation and benefits expense prior to realizing associated additional revenues 
additionally  we may not be able to retain our professionals at compensation levels that are within our target range 
we therefore thoroughly evaluate business and personnel decisions with respect to our target range and are required to continually assess whether our target range remains appropriate for our business 
further  in we granted equity awards as part of our compensation and hiring process  the full expense of which was not recognized in and which instead will be recognized pro rata over the four year vesting period

marketing and promotion expenses decreased million due to a reduction in conference and event related expenses  and communications and data processing expenses decreased million as a result of our migrating to a lower cost laptop and desktop computer base in late finally  depreciation and amortization expense decreased million due to a write off of certain leasehold improvements located in office space that we exited during  as well as certain furniture becoming fully depreciated during the second half of and no longer incurring depreciation expense 
overall  non compensation expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased slightly to in from in provision for taxes before completion of our initial public offering on february   we were a limited liability company and all of our income and losses were reportable by our individual members in accordance with the internal revenue code and  accordingly  the us federal and state income taxes payable by our members  based upon their share of our net income  had not been reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements

valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
during the three months ended march   we recognized a one time tax benefit of million in connection with the establishment of our deferred tax asset balances of million  offset by establishing a valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance was recorded because management concluded that a portion of the deferred tax benefit  which results from unrealized capital losses  more likely than not will not be realized due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate future capital gains to offset such capital losses 
in the fourth quarter of  both the deferred tax asset and the valuation allowance beginning balances were adjusted downward by million  resulting in balances of million and million  respectively

we also have a secured financing arrangement with general electric capital corporation that is secured by furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements  with a year term and a variable interest rate at libor plus 
as of december   the outstanding balance under this facility was million

the timing of bonus and retention compensation payments to our employees may significantly affect our cash position and liquidity from period to period 
while our employees are generally paid salaries semi monthly during the year  bonus and retention compensation payments  which make up a larger portion of total compensation  are generally paid at selected times during the year 
bonus and retention compensation payments for a given year are generally paid in february and july of the following year

we have the option to deliver cash  common stock or a combination thereof in satisfaction of our obligations thereunder 
to the extent we elect to deliver cash  the timing of these delivery obligations will also affect our cash position and liquidity 
in connection with our initial public offering of common stock  we issued million of unsecured senior notes to our former class d and class d shareholders and are required to make principal and interest payments on these notes in accordance with their terms 
thomas weisel partners llc  our wholly owned subsidiary and a registered securities broker dealer  is subject to the net capital requirements of the nyse and the sec s uniform net capital rule

at december   and thomas weisel partners llc had excess net capital of million  million and million  respectively 
regulatory net capital requirements change based on certain investment and underwriting activities 
due to the nature of our investment banking and brokerage businesses  liquidity is of critical importance to us 
accordingly  we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including our cash and net capital positions 
we believe that our current level of equity capital  which includes the net proceeds to us from our initial public offering and our follow on offering and funds anticipated to be provided by operating activities  will be adequate to meet our liquidity and regulatory capital requirements for the next months

investing activities used million of cash during  including the purchase of million of municipal and auction rate securities  investments in private equity partnerships of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
this decrease in cash and cash equivalents is partially offset by proceeds from sale of investments of million

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and their notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical 
table of contents accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
fair value of financial instruments securities owned  securities sold  but not yet purchased and other investments in our consolidated statements of financial condition consist of financial instruments carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in our results of operations 
the use of fair value to measure these financial instruments  with related unrealized gains and losses recognized immediately in our results of operations  is fundamental to our consolidated financial statements and is one of our most critical accounting policies 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
fair values of our financial instruments are generally obtained from quoted market prices in active markets  broker or dealer price quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
to the extent certain financial instruments trade infrequently or are non marketable securities and  therefore  have little or no price transparency  we value these instruments using methodologies such as the present value of known or estimated cash flows and generally do not adjust underlying valuation assumptions unless there is substantive evidence supporting a change in the value of the underlying instrument or valuation assumptions such as similar market transactions  changes in financial ratios and changes in credit ratings of the underlying companies 
financial instruments we own long positions are marked to bid prices and instruments we have sold but not yet purchased short positions are marked to offer prices 
if liquidating a position is reasonably expected to affect its prevailing market price  our valuation is adjusted generally based on market evidence or predetermined policies 
in certain circumstances  such as for highly illiquid positions  management s estimates are used to determine this adjustment 
private equity investment partnerships investments in partnerships include our general partnership interests in investment partnerships 
these interests are carried at fair value based on our percentage interest in the underlying partnerships 
the net assets of the investment partnerships consist primarily of investments in marketable and non marketable securities 
the underlying investments held by such partnerships are valued based on quoted market prices  or estimated fair value if there is no public market 
such estimates of fair value of the partnerships non marketable investments are ultimately determined by us or our affiliates in our capacity as general partner and  in the case of an investment in an unaffiliated investment partnership  are based on financial statements prepared by an unaffiliated general partner 
due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation  fair values of these non marketable investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments  and the differences could be material 
adjustments to carrying value are made if there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value 
downward adjustments are also made  in the absence of third party transactions  if we determine that the expected realizable value of the investment is less than the carrying value 
in reaching that determination  we consider many factors including  but not limited to  the operating cash flows and financial performance of the companies relative to budgets or projections  trends within sectors and or regions  underlying business models  expected exit timing and strategy  and any specific rights or terms associated with the investment  such as conversion features and liquidation preferences 
in cases where an estimate of fair value is determined based on financial statements prepared by an unaffiliated general partner  such financial statements are generally unaudited other than audited year end financial statements 
upon receipt of audited financial statements from an investment partnership  we reconcile our subsequent financial statements to those audited partnership results 

table of contents the investment partnerships that we are a general partner of may make carried interest distributions to us if the partnership assets reach a certain fair value threshold as defined in the respective partnership agreement 
the carried interest distributions are calculated as a percentage of fund assets in excess of each partner s contributed capital and fund expenses 
we recognize the fair value of its carried interest associated with unrealized gains in investment partnerships once the respective fair value threshold has been met 
we earn fees from the investment partnerships which we manage or are a general partner of 
such management fees are generally based on the net assets or committed capital of the underlying partnerships 
in addition  we are entitled to allocations of the appreciation and depreciation in the fair value of the underlying partnerships from our general partnership interests in the partnerships 
such allocations are based on the terms of the respective partnership agreements 
we have agreed in certain cases to waive management fees  in lieu of making a cash contribution  in satisfaction of the general partner investment commitments to the investment partnerships 
in these cases  we generally recognize our management fee revenues at the time when we are allocated our special profit interests in the gain from these partnerships upon the realization of a partnership investment 
we are entitled to receive incentive fee allocations from the investment partnerships when the return exceeds certain threshold returns 
incentive fees are based on investment performance over the life of each investment partnership  and future investment underperformance may require amounts previously distributed to us to be returned to the partnership 
liability for lease losses our accrued expenses and other liabilities include a liability for lease losses related to office space that we subleased or abandoned due to staff reductions 
the liability for lease losses was million at december  and will expire with the termination of the relevant facility leases through we estimate our liability for lease losses as the net present value of the differences between lease payments and receipts under sublease agreements  if any 
this liability is affected by our estimate of future facility requirements and sublease assumptions  including assumptions regarding our intent to reoccupy subleased space following the expiration of subleases 
if we subsequently determine that we will not utilize space or decide to sublease additional space  this liability could increase with a corresponding charge to expenses 
during we recorded a million charge primarily related to our decision to sublease  at a lower rate than our current lease rate  certain premises in san francisco  menlo park and boston 
legal and other contingent liabilities we are involved in various pending and potential complaints  arbitrations  legal actions  investigations and proceedings related to our business 
some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts  including claims for punitive and other special damages 
the number of complaints  legal actions  investigations and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions like us has been increasing in recent years 
we have  after consultation with counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  to the extent that a claim may result in a probable loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management and our ultimate liabilities may be materially different 
in making these determinations  management considers many factors  including  but not limited to  the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant  the basis and validity of the claim  the likelihood of successful defense against the claim and the potential for  and magnitude of  damages or settlements from such pending and potential complaints  legal actions  arbitrations  investigations and proceedings  and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies 
see note commitments  guarantees and contingencies for a further description of legal proceedings 

table of contents if a potential adverse contingency should become probable or resolved for an amount in excess of the established reserves during any period  our results of operations in that period and  in some cases  succeeding periods could be materially adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts our receivables include corporate finance and syndicate receivables relating to our investment banking or advisory engagements 
we also have receivables from our clearing brokers in connection with the clearing of our brokerage transactions 
we indemnify the clearing brokers for any losses as a result of a customer s nonperformance 
in addition  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts on revenue receivables on a specific identification basis 
management is continually evaluating our receivables for collectibility and possible write off by examining the facts and circumstances surrounding each specific case where a loss is deemed a possibility 
deferred tax valuation allowance as a corporation  we are subject to federal and state income taxes 
in determining our provision for income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
for our investments in partnerships  adjustments to their carrying value are made based on determinations of the fair value of underlying investments held by such partnerships 
both upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of investment partnerships  which are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations  represent timing differences until such time as these gains and losses are realized 
as of december   we have net unrealized capital losses on these investment partnerships 
to the extent we are not able to generate future realized capital gains  we would not be able to recognize our deferred tax asset as a tax benefit 
due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate future realized capital gains to offset capital losses  we recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset attributable to net unrealized losses in our investment partnerships 
as of december   the deferred tax asset recorded to reflect these net unrealized losses is million  and the related valuation allowance is million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business and financing activities directly expose us to various types of risks  including i market risk relating to  among other things  the changes in the market value of equity or debt instruments and ii interest rate risk relating to the effect of changes in interest rates and the yield curve on the value of debt instruments that we hold and our payment obligations in respect of notes that we have issued 
we are also exposed to other risks in the conduct of our business such as credit risk and the effects of inflation 
our exposure to these risks could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
set forth below is a discussion of some of these risks together with quantitative information regarding the aggregate amount and value of financial instruments that we hold or maintain a position in or that we have issued and that remain outstanding  in each case  as of december  and due to the nature of our business  in particular our trading business  the amount or value of financial instruments that we hold or maintain a position in will fluctuate on a daily and intra day basis and the year end values and amounts presented below are not necessarily indicative of the exposures to market risk  interest rate risk and other risks we may experience at various times throughout any given year 
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may result from the change in value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in its market price 
market risk may be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from transacting in normal quantities and or at normal bid offer spreads 
our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as a financial intermediary in customer trading and to our market making and investment activities  which activities include committing from time to time to purchase large blocks of stock from publicly traded issuers or their significant shareholders 
we trade in equity and convertible debt securities as an active participant in both listed and otc equity and convertible markets and typically maintain securities in inventory to facilitate our market making activities and customer order flow 
we are also exposed to market risk from our asset management business  both as a result of our investments in private equity  venture capital and other investment funds we manage or have managed and as a result of our providing seed investment funds for new asset management products 
market risk is inherent in financial instruments 

table of contents the following tables categorize our market risk sensitive financial instruments by type of security and  where applicable  by maturity date as of december  and as of december  in thousands fair value total as of expected maturity date principal december  thereafter amount inventory positions convertible bonds long equity securities long total long convertible bonds short us treasury securities short equity securities short total short other investments auction rate securities  a  municipal debt securities equity securities a represents earlier of contractual maturity or repricing date  which we believe represents the market risk inherent in the underlying instrument

table of contents in connection with our asset management activities  we provide seed investment funds for new asset management products to be invested in long and short positions in publicly traded equities and related options and other derivative instruments 
these seed investments are included in the tables presented above 
in addition to the positions set forth in the table above  we maintain investments in private equity  venture capital and other investment funds we manage or have managed 
these investments are carried at fair value in accordance with industry guidance and as of december  and the carrying amount of these investments was million and million  respectively 
from time to time we may use a variety of risk management techniques and hedging strategies in the ordinary course of our brokerage activities  including establishing position limits by product type and industry sector  closely monitoring inventory turnover  maintaining long and short positions in related securities  and using exchange traded equity options and other derivative instruments 
in connection with our brokerage activities  management reviews reports appropriate to the risk profile of specific trading activities 
typically  market conditions are evaluated and transaction details and securities positions are reviewed 
these activities seek to ensure that trading strategies are within acceptable risk tolerance parameters  particularly when we commit our own capital to facilitate client trading 
our accounting department is actively involved in ensuring the integrity and clarity of the daily profit and loss statements  to the extent that we maintain trading positions for a period longer than one day 
activities include price verification procedures  position reconciliation and review of transaction booking 
we believe that these procedures  which stress timely communications between our traders  institutional brokerage management and senior management  are important elements in evaluating and addressing market risk 
as described in note financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  credit risk or market risk to our consolidated financial statements  we are a party to an employment agreement whose value is indexed to publicly traded shares of an unrelated entity 
this agreement is considered a derivative under applicable gaap and  accordingly  is marked to market through compensation and benefits expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of this derivative was million and million at december  and  respectively  and is not reflected in the table above 
we have also reduced our exposure to fluctuations in the underlying security by purchasing shares of the underlying security  which are included under other investments in the table above 
in accordance with our stated accounting policy  these shares are carried at market value with fluctuations in value reflected in asset management revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential loss from adverse changes in market interest rates 
as we may hold us treasury securities and other fixed income securities as well as convertible debt securities and incur interest sensitive liabilities from time to time  we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and in the shape of the yield curve 
certain of these interest rate risks may be managed through the use of short positions in us government and corporate debt securities and other instruments 
in addition  we issued floating rate notes to california public employees retirement system and nomura america investment  inc in connection with our reorganization on february  and are  therefore  exposed to the risk of higher interest payments on those notes if interest rates rise

the orders are then settled by unrelated clearing organizations that maintain custody of customers securities and provide financing to customers 
the majority of our transactions  and consequently the concentration of our credit exposure  is with our clearing brokers 
the clearing brokers are also the primary source of our short term financing securities sold  not yet purchased  which is collateralized by cash and securities owned by us and held by the clearing brokers 
our securities owned may be pledged by the clearing brokers 
the amount receivable from payable to the clearing brokers represents amounts receivable payable in connection with the proprietary and customer trading activities 
as of december  and  our cash on deposit with the clearing brokers was not collateralizing any liabilities to the clearing brokers 
in addition to the clearing brokers  we are exposed to credit risk from other brokers  dealers and other financial institutions with which we transact business 
through indemnification provisions in our agreement with our clearing organizations  customer activities may expose us to off balance sheet credit risk 
we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices in the event a customer fails to settle a trade on its original terms or in the event cash and securities in customer margin accounts are not sufficient to fully cover customer obligations 
we seek to control the risks associated with brokerage services for our customers through customer screening and selection procedures as well as through requirements that customers maintain margin collateral in compliance with governmental and self regulatory organization regulations and clearing organization policies 

table of contents effects of inflation because our assets are generally liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as employee compensation  office leasing costs and communications charges  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations
