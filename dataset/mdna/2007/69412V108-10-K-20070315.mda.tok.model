on november   the company acquired nwbf for a combination of stock and cash 
combined  the stock and cash transaction was valued at approximately  the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the results of operations of nwbf have been included in the consolidated financial statement only since the date of acquisition 
per share data for was retroactively adjusted to reflect the for stock split declared in september tangible equity excludes goodwill and core deposit intangible related to acquisitions 
the company earned  in compared to  in growth in operating revenue  which consists of net interest income plus noninterest income was primarily responsible for the increased earnings in over operating revenues were  in  up  or over operating revenue growth was driven by a increase in average earning assets resulting in a  increase in net interest income 
growth in earning assets was due to the full year effect of assets acquired in the nwbf transactions and organic growth 
when comparing and results  it is also fair to consider the effects of several unusual transactions and the adoption of new accounting standards 
effective january   the company implemented fas r  share based payment  which requires the expensing of stock based compensation 
the company elected to implement fas r using the modified prospective method  meaning there was no restatement of prior periods 
for the year ended december   the company recognized in stock based compensation expense within the income statement 
had the accounting principle been effective in  the company would have recognized in stock based compensation expense which would have reduced full year diluted earnings per share by 
also during the oregon legislature  as required in the oregon constitution  refunded to the company a state income tax kicker reducing state income taxes by which was recognized by the company in the fourth quarter  increasing diluted earnings per share for the year by 
during the third quarter  the company sold two rental properties that the bank had purchased in and held for possible office expansion 
the sale resulted in a pretax non interest income gain of in addition  during the third quarter  the bank expensed the remaining unamortized loan premium of from its purchase of the coos bay consumer finance office 
the net after tax gain associated with these two unusual transactions resulted in a per diluted share contribution to full year earnings 
the company earned  in compared to  in growth in operating revenue was primarily responsible for the increased earnings in over operating revenues in grew by  or over operating revenue growth was driven by a increase in average earning assets resulting in a increase in net interest income 
the increase in net interest income was partially offset by a decline in noninterest income due to lower service charges on deposit accounts  other deposit related service fees  and income from the origination of residential mortgages 
period end assets at december  were  compared to  at december  core deposits  which are defined as demand deposits  interest checking  money market accounts  and local time deposits including local time deposits over thousand constitute of december  outstanding deposits 
demand deposits were  or of total deposits at year end december during  the company believes the following factors could impact reported financial results a flat or inverted yield curve that would reduce spreads between the bank s yield on fixed rate loans and the bank s short term borrowing costs and costs of core deposits  which could negatively affect the net interest margin and revenue growth 
the ability to manage noninterest expense growth in light of expected slow revenue growth 
the ability to grow core deposits  to fund expected loan growth during the local and regional economies and their effect on loan demand  the credit quality of existing clients with lending relationships  and vacancy rates of commercial real estate properties  since a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate

summary of critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in item of this report 
management believes that the following policies and those disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements should be considered critical under the sec definition allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for outstanding loans is classified as a contra asset account offsetting outstanding loans  and the allowance for unfunded commitments is classified as an other liability on the balance sheet 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balances of the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans and unfunded commitments are maintained at an amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio and commitments to loan funds 
the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses is determined by applying loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolios  industry concentrations  and the impact of current local  regional  and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations  or liquidity 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   the company had  in goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standard  goodwill and other intangible assets  assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis of the intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually and has determined that there was no impairment as of december  and share based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas r  share based payment  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based forms of compensation issued to employees 
this standard became effective in the first quarter of the method for determining the grant date fair value of equity based payments under fas r is the same as the method used by the company to calculate the pro forma impact on and net income and earnings per share as presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
the company adopted fas r using the modified prospective method 
therefore  previously reported financial data was not restated  and expenses related to equity based payments granted and vesting during were recorded as compensation expense 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncement are discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in item of this report 
none of these pronouncements are expected to have a significant effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations net interest income the largest component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income derived from earning assets  principally loans  and the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources  market rates of interest  demand for loans  and the availability of deposits affect net interest income 
two tables follow which analyze the changes in net interest income for   and table i  average balance analysis of net interest earnings  provides information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as associated dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense  relevant average yields or rates  and net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
table ii  analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
changes not solely due to volume or rate are allocated to rate 
compared to net interest income for was  an increase of  over net interest income of  the growth in net interest income in over was attributable to a  or increase in earning assets 
the acquisition of nwbf in november  was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  thus the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in the balance sheet only since the date of acquisition 
the earning assets acquired in this transaction accounted for approximately  of the growth in earning assets in when compared to for the year  the net interest income as a percentage of earning assets decreased by basis points from to 
much of the decline in the net interest margin in when compared to can be attributed to the acquisition of nwbf  which had a much lower net interest margin at than the bank s net interest margin of approximately prior to the acquisition 
the bank s net interest margin when adjusted for the unusual accelerated amortization of the coos bay loan premium described in the highlights above was very stable and improved throughout the year as evidenced by sequential margins beginning with first quarter of  and increasing each quarter to   and  respectively 
this improvement in the quarterly net interest margin can be attributed to core deposit growth  which accelerated during the last nine months of the year 
for  interest and fees earned on earning assets increased by  over referring to table ii  total interest income and fees improved by  due to increased earning asset volumes and improved  due to higher yields on earning assets 
average earning assets for were  a increase over average earning assets 
growth in earning assets was primarily attributable to loan growth as average loans  net of the allowance for loan losses for the year  were up  or over the acquisition of nwbf increased average loans by approximately  in when compared to referring to table i  earning asset yields increased by basis points  from in to in the improvement in earning asset yield was primarily due to increased loan yields  which were up basis points in over the increase in loan yields is reflective of the consistent increase in the prime lending rate throughout the first six months of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities during increased by  or over referring to table i  overall average interest bearing liabilities in increased by  over  while the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points from to 
the acquisition of nwbf accounted for a substantial portion of the growth in interest bearing deposits in addition to the organic growth from the two oregon markets 
referring to table ii  interest expense increased by  due to the change in the mix and increased volumes of interest bearing liabilities 
table ii also indicates that interest expense for the year increased an additional  due to higher rates  a direct result of the increase in short term market interest rates during the first six months of table ii shows the increase in the average volumes of money market and now accounts  time deposits  and fhlb borrowings  were primarily responsible for the increase in interest expense due to higher volumes for when compared to the increase in interest expense for the year over resulting from higher rates was primarily due to increased volumes and higher rates paid on money market and now accounts  time deposits  and fhlb borrowings 
table i shows the average volume of money market and now accounts increased  or  and average time deposit volume increased  or over average volumes  while the rate on these deposits increased basis points and basis points  respectively 
tables i and ii shows that the increase in the average volume of fhlb term borrowings increased  and accounted for  or of the total increase in interest expense for the year over that was related to volume 
the average volume of trust preferred securities increased by  in over  which resulted in additional interest expense in over the trust preferred securities were issued in conjunction with the acquisition of nwbf and thus were only included in the average balance sheet since the date of acquisition on november  the company s net interest margin benefited from growth in noninterest bearing deposits 
for the year  average noninterest bearing deposits grew by  or over average noninterest bearing deposits funded of total average assets for the year during the first six months of  the federal reserve increased short term rates by basis points in a continuation of rising interest rates that began in june since june   the federal reserve has held short term market interest rates steady with the overnight fed funds rate at approximately and the prime lending rate at 
although the bank is asset sensitive  meaning the net interest margin should improve during a rising rate environment  the increases in market interest rates during and had little positive effect on the net interest margin 
this was primarily the result of two factors 
first  a flat and inverted yield curve  where long term rates rose at a much slower pace than short term rates kept the yields on fixed rate loans low  thus narrowing the spread between the bank s borrowing and core deposit costs and the yield on its new and existing fixed rate loan portfolio 
second  consistently throughout the first six months of  there was a timing lag between the increases in short term money market rates  which moved borrowing costs and deposit rates up in advance of the bank s prime lending rate also creating margin compression 
looking forward to the first quarter  the company expects the net interest margin to be flat to down slightly from the net interest margin recorded for the fourth quarter historically  the bank s oregon market experiences flat to negative growth in its core deposit base during the first quarter of each year  while loan activity remains strong 
this would potentially decrease the bank s net interest margin as the reduction in core deposits typically occurs in lower cost demand and commercial money market accounts 
the company believes there are opportunities during to improve the net interest margin through core deposit growth 
steady growth is expected in the bank s lane county market  while growth in the seattle area is expected to markedly improve 
in addition  the relatively new vancouver  washington office and the relocation of the tualatin office in the bank s portland market is expected to contribute to core deposit growth in oregon during however  any improvement the bank s net interest margin during is highly dependent upon core deposit growth 
compared to net interest income for was  an increase of  over net interest income of  for the year  the net interest income as a percentage of earning assets decreased by basis points from to 
generally  the decline in the net interest margin in when compared to can be attributed to the bank s cost of funds rising faster than the yield on its loan portfolio 
for the year  interest and fees earned on earning assets increased by  or over referring to table ii  total interest income and fees improved by  due to increased earning asset volumes and improved  due to higher yields on earning assets 
average earning assets for were  a increase over average earning assets 
growth in earning assets was primarily attributable to loan growth as average loans  net of the allowance for loan losses for the year  were up  or over referring to table i  earning asset yields increased by basis points  from in to in the improvement in earning asset yield was primarily due to increased loan yields  which were up basis points in over the increase in loan yields is reflective of the consistent increase in the prime lending rate throughout the year interest expense on interest bearing liabilities during increased by  or over referring to table i  overall average interest bearing liabilities in increased by  or over  while the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points from to 
referring to table ii  interest expense increased by  due to the change in the mix and increased volumes of interest bearing liabilities 
table ii also indicates that interest expense for the year increased an additional  due to higher rates  a direct result of the increase in short term market interest rates throughout the year table ii shows the increase in the average volumes of money market and now accounts  time deposits  and fhlb borrowings  were primarily responsible for the increase in interest expense due to higher volumes for when compared to again referring to table ii  the increase in interest expense for the year over resulting from higher rates was primarily due to increased rates paid on money market and now accounts and time deposits 
table i shows the average volume of money market and now accounts increased  or and average time deposit volume increased  or over average volumes  while the rate on these deposits increased basis points and basis points  respectively 
the increase in time deposit volume primarily involved local market time deposits in excess of  national time deposits  and public deposits 
table ii shows that the increase in the average volume of fhlb term borrowings accounted for  or of the total increase in interest expense for the year over that was related to volume 
however  lower rates paid on fhlb advances during the year when compared to mitigated a portion of the increase in interest expense from the higher usage of fhlb advances 
the company s net interest margin benefited from growth in noninterest bearing deposits 
for the year  average noninterest bearing deposits grew by  or over average noninterest bearing deposits funded of total average assets for the year during  the federal reserve increased short term rates as they did during the last six months of from january through december  the federal reserve increased short term interest rates by basis points on top of the basis point increase in short term rates during the last six months of the increase in market interest rates during increased the bank s prime lending rate from at the beginning of the year to at year end although the bank was asset sensitive  meaning the net interest margin would improve during a rising rate environment  the increases in market interest rates during had little positive effect on the net interest margin 
this was primarily the result of two factors 
first  a flattening yield curve  where long term rates rose at a much slower pace than short term rates keeping the yields on fixed rate loans low  thus narrowing the spread between the bank s borrowing and core deposit costs and the yield on its fixed rate loan portfolio 
second  consistently throughout the year  there was a timing lag between the increases in short term money market rates  which moved borrowing costs and deposit rates up in advance of the bank s prime lending rate also creating margin compression

the level of the allowance is determined based upon judgments regarding the size and nature of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  the financial condition of borrowers  the level of nonperforming loans  and current general economic conditions 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes the collection of principal is unlikely 
the provision for loan losses totaled in   in  and in the lower provision for when compared to resulted from improvement in credit quality throughout the year the higher provision for over reflected growth in the bank s outstanding loans during the year 
at december   the bank had no nonperforming assets  nonaccrual loans  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  or foreclosed property 
that compares to of nonperforming assets at december  or of year end assets 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was  of outstanding loans compared to  of loans and  of loans at years end and  respectively 
the december  allowance for loan losses included  in allowance added through the acquisition of nwbf 
at december   the bank also has reserved for possible losses on unfunded loan commitments  which is classified in other liabilities 
the ending allowance includes in specific allowance for in impaired loans consisting of two loans to a single borrower that are both performing under revised terms 
at december   the company had of impaired loans net of government guarantees with a specific allowance assigned of net loan charge offs were in compared to in  and in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were   and for   and  respectively 
looking forward  the provision for loans losses will be contingent on current economic and market conditions  and overall loan growth  as there is virtually no benefit available from further improvement in the loan portfolio credit statistics 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate for estimated loan losses in the portfolio at year end based on management s assessment of various factors including past due and impaired loans  past history and loss experience  loan concentrations in specific industries  and current economic conditions 
noninterest income noninterest income is derived from sources other than fees and interest on earning assets 
the company s primary sources of noninterest income are service charge fees on deposit accounts  merchant bankcard activity  income derived from mortgage banking services  and gains on the sale of loans 
compared to noninterest income in was  up or from excluding the nonrecurring gain on the sale of property of  noninterest income was down from total noninterest income through december  included approximately of revenues from the seattle market not included in results 
the decrease in noninterest income excluding the nonrecurring gain on sale of property was primarily due to lower account service charges  mortgage banking revenues  and loan servicing income 
account service charges were down or from last year as the increased earnings credit on analyzed business accounts lowered fee income 
mortgage banking revenues were down or from as higher long term interest rates slowed the level of mortgage loan originations and the service release premium on loans sold 
loan servicing income was down or from as the average volume of loans serviced declined in from declines in these categories of noninterest income was partially offset by increase in merchant bankcard fee income and a increase in the other income category 
the increase in merchant bankcard revenues resulted from an increase in sales transaction volume 
the increase in the other income category was due to lockbox fees and sundry recoveries 
compared to noninterest income in was  a decrease of or from the decline in noninterest income was primarily due to five categories account service charges  nsf od fees  residential mortgage revenues  merchant bankcard fees  and loan servicing fees 
account service charges were down or from as the increase in the day treasury bill rate increased the earnings credit on analyzed business demand accounts  which lowered fee income on these accounts 
nsf od fees in dropped or from due to lower transaction volume 
revenues from the origination of residential mortgages were down or from as a result of higher long term interest rates during the year that slowed loan originations 
the merchant bankcard division achieved a growth in sales transaction volume in over however  competitive pricing pressures resulted in a lower profit margin  thus reducing noninterest income from this division by or from loan servicing fees in declined by or from due to a decline in the level of loans serviced for and participated to other financial institutions 
other revenue sources accounted for a increase in noninterest revenue compared to noninterest expense noninterest expense represents all expenses other than the provision for loan losses and interest costs associated with deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
it incorporates personnel  premises and equipment  data processing and other operating expenses 
compared to noninterest expense in was  up  or over with every expense category up in when compared to total noninterest expense in includes  of expenses from the seattle market not included in results 
in addition  the company implemented fas r in  which required the expensing of equity based compensation 
the company implemented this new accounting principle using the modified prospective basis  meaning there was no restatement of prior periods 
for the year  the company recognized more in equity compensation expense than was recorded during excluding the  increase due to seattle market expenses and equity based compensation of  noninterest expense in increased  or over increased personnel expense accounted for the majority of the total increase in noninterest expense 
total personnel expense was up  and accounted for of the total increase in noninterest expense 
the increase in personnel expense in over reflects the addition of the seattle market  increased staffing in the portland market where two new offices were opened  and increased administrative staff 
premises and equipment expense was up or and reflects the new costs in the seattle market  plus additional expense related to new offices in the portland market 
the other expense category was up  or primarily due to higher professional services including legal fees  consulting fees  and fees related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
during  the company made significant investments in people and facilities in all markets  establishing a foundation for growth in during  the company expects noninterest expense growth to abate from the growth rate 
in addition  on a sequential quarter or linked quarter basis in  relatively small increases in expenses are expected 
the company does expect certain expense categories to increase in over  such as the new fdic insurance assessment  which is expected to add approximately to noninterest expense in when compared to compared to noninterest expense in was  up  or over the acquisition of nwbf accounted for approximately of the total expense increase 
in addition  the bank incurred approximately in merger related expenses that was ultimately eliminated following the systems conversion in the first quarter the increase in expenses in over resulted primarily from increased personnel expense  premises and equipment expense  advertising  and various other expenses 
personnel expenses were up  or in over reflecting increased staffing  increased accruals for incentive compensation  and higher group insurance costs 
group insurance expense accounted for of the total increase in personnel cost for the year occupancy and equipment expense in was up or over reflecting remodeling costs of the bank s olive street office in eugene  oregon  elimination of rental income from the bank s olive street office  and rent expense for the seattle market offices 
the increase in business development expense of in over was primarily the result of a planned increase in advertising expense related to production costs of new media campaigns and increased media and specialty advertising in the portland market 
various other expense categories  primarily sundry losses  travel  and subscription expenses  accounted for the increase in the other expense category 
balance sheet loans at december  outstanding loans  net of deferred loan fees and excluding loans held for sale  were  up  over outstanding loans of  at december  a summary of loan growth by market for the year follows outstanding loans january  portland lane county seattle outstanding loans december  loan growth rates in over for portland  lane county  and seattle were   and  respectively 
more information on the loan portfolio can be found in statistical information in item and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   the company had a recorded balance of  goodwill of which  is from the november  acquisition of nwbf and from the acquisition of the coos bay consumer finance office 
in addition  at december  the company had  core deposit intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of nwbf 
the core deposit intangible was determined to have an expected life of approximately seven years and is being amortized over that period using the straight line method 
during  the company amortized of the core deposit intangible 
in accordance with financial accounting standard fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company does not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead periodically tests these assets for impairment 
management did perform an impairment analysis at december  and determined there was no impairment of the goodwill at the time of the analysis 
deposits outstanding deposits at december  were  an increase of  over outstanding deposits of  at december  core deposits  which are defined by the company as demand  interest checking  money market  savings  and local time deposits  including local time deposits in excess of thousand  were  and  at december  and  respectively  and represented and of total deposits  respectively

these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
these guidelines require a minimum of total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
the regulations also specify that a total risk based capital ratio is required to be designated well capitalized the highest fdic capital rating by the fdic 
the company s tier i capital  which consists of shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill  and deposit based intangibles  totaled  at december  tier ii capital components include all  or a portion of the allowance for loan losses and the portion of trust preferred securities in excess of tier i statutory limits

the company declared and paid cash dividends of per share for the year that compares to cash dividends of paid during the board of directors  at its february  meeting  approved a dividend of per share for shareholders of record as of february the company projects that earnings retention and existing capital will be sufficient to fund anticipated asset growth  while maintaining a well capitalized designation from all regulatory agencies 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments in the normal course of business  the bank commits to extensions of credit and issues letters of credit 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments to lend funds and conditional obligations as it does for other credit products 
in the event of nonperformance by the customer  the bank s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established by the contract 
since some commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december   the bank had  in commitments to extend credit 
letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
at december   the bank had  in letters of credit and financial guarantees written 
the bank also has internal guidance lines of credit established for certain borrowers  primarily in the residential construction industry 
these guidance lines are not contractual commitments to extend credit  and may be terminated by the bank for any reason without any obligation to the borrower 
these lines provide the bank s lenders limits on future extensions of credit to certain borrowers 
the bank uses the same credit policies in establishing internal guidance lines as it does for other credit products 
at december   the bank had established unused and uncommitted guidance lines totaling approximately  the company has certain other financial commitments 
these future financial commitments are outlined below contractual obligations dollars in thousands total less than one year years years more than years junior subordinated debenture fhlb borrowings time deposits operating lease obligations liquidity liquidity is the term used to define the company s ability to meet its financial commitments 
the company maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure funds are available for both lending needs and the withdrawal of deposit funds 
the company derives liquidity through core deposit growth  maturity of investment securities  and loan payments 
core deposits include demand  interest checking  money market  savings  and local time deposits  including local time deposits in excess of additional liquidity and funding sources are provided through the sale of loans  sales of securities  access to national cd markets  and both secured and unsecured borrowings 
core deposits at december  were of total deposits compared to at december  core deposit growth of  in all markets funded of loan growth during the year the remainder of loan growth was funded through alternative funding sources  including overnight borrowed funds  federal home loan bank term advances  public deposits available from the state of oregon  state of washington  and national market time deposits 
the company has deposit relationships with several large clients  which are closely monitored by bank officers 
at december   thirteen large deposit relationships with the bank account for  or of total deposits

therefore  inflation has a less significant impact on the company than does fluctuation in market interest rates 
inflation can lead to accelerated growth in noninterest expenses  which impacts net earnings 
during the last two years  inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  has not changed significantly 
the effects of this inflation have not had a material impact on the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are largely dependent upon its ability to manage market risks 
changes in interest rates can have a significant effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
although permitted by its funds management policy  the company does not presently use derivatives such as forward and futures contracts  options  or interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
other types of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate risk generally arises when the maturity or repricing structure of the company s assets and liabilities differ significantly 
asset and liability management  which among other things addresses such risk  is the process of developing  testing and implementing strategies that seek to maximize net interest income while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
this process includes monitoring contractual maturity and prepayment expectations together with expected repricing of assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios 
generally  the company seeks a structure that insulates net interest income from large deviations attributable to changes in market rates 
interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s balance sheet by subjecting various asset and liability categories to interest rate shocks and gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time 
interest rate shocks use an instantaneous adjustment in market rates of large magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income and capital for the succeeding twelve month period 
such an extreme change in interest rates and the assumption that management would take no steps to restructure the balance sheet does limit the usefulness of this type of analysis 
this type of analysis tends to provide a best case or worst case scenario 
in addition to the interest rate shock analysis  the company also prepares a rolling four quarter forecast of the balance sheet and income statement using a flat rate scenario ie rates unchanged and a most likely rate scenario where rates are projected to change based on management s analysis of expected economic conditions and interest rate environment 
this analysis takes into account growth in loans and deposits and management strategies that could be employed to maximize the net interest margin and net interest income 
the company utilizes in house asset liability modeling software  profitstar to determine the effect changes in interest rates have on net interest income 
interest rate shock scenarios are modeled in basis point increments plus or minus in the federal funds rate 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar repricing characteristics  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits would likely deviate from those previously assumed 
increases in market rates may also affect the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled principal payments 
the model attempts to account for such limitations by imposing weights on the differences between repricing assets and repricing liabilities within each time segment 
these weights are based on the ratio between the amount of rate change of each category of asset or liability  and the amount of change in the federal funds rate 
certain non maturing liabilities such as checking accounts and money market deposit accounts are allocated among the various repricing time segments to meet local competitive conditions and management s strategies 
during  the model indicated that the company continued to be asset sensitive and projects rising margins in a rising rate environment and declining margins in a falling rate environment 
however  like many banks showing an asset sensitive position  the bank s net interest margin did not materially improve during despite the increase in short term interest rates as a result of the flat and inverted yield curve that existed throughout the year 
the following table shows the estimated impact of interest rate changes plus basis point and minus basis points on net interest income in basis point increments 
the table indicates that the bank s net interest income does not materially change in rapidly rising or falling interest rate environments  thus indicating a relatively balanced interest rate risk position 
the base figure of  used in the analysis represents actual net interest income for the year due to the various assumptions used for this modeling  no assurance can be given that projections will reflect actual results
