item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction  integrys energy group integrys energy services and market price risk management activities integrys energy group 
facilities at december   integrys energy services owned and operated electric generation facilities in the midwest and northeast regions of the united states with a total rated capacity of approximately megawatts 
in january  integrys energy services sold its subsidiary wps niagara generation  llc which owned the megawatt niagara falls generation facility 
the sale of this facility reduced the production capacity of integrys energy services to approximately megawatts 
as part of the asset management strategy of integrys energy group  integrys energy services continues to explore opportunities regarding the future of its electric generation facilities 
opportunities include  but are not limited to purchase  sales or development of certain facilities  joint ventures and long term contracts 
opportunities change and develop with the dynamics of the markets in which integrys energy services operates 
integrys energy services beaver falls generation facility is currently out of service as a result of damage to its turbine blades 
integrys energy services has begun repairs on the facility 
total cost of the repairs  net of insurance coverage  is expected to be approximately million and the unit is expected to be back in service in june for additional information regarding generation facilities of integrys energy services  see item properties in this annual report on form k 
fuel supply integrys energy services fuel inventory policy varies for each generation facility depending on the type of fuel used and available natural gas storage facilities 
in  integrys energy services merchant coal fired generation facilities consisted of its westwood and stoneman facilities 
these plants burned approximately  tons of coal and culm in actual fuel needs in will depend on market conditions and operational capability of these facilities 
integrys energy services westwood facility burns waste coal left behind by mining operations and has several years supply on site 
all fuel is located within a seven mile radius of the plant 
the stoneman facility currently has all of its coal needs under contract with options for fuel needs 
integrys energy services provides all natural gas supply for the natural gas fired facilities in beaver falls  syracuse and combined locks and currently has adequate transport and supply arrangements for projected needs 
licenses integrys energy services is a ferc licensed power marketer with import export authorization through the doe 
integrys energy services on its own  or through certain of its subsidiaries  is registered to sell retail electric service in the states of connecticut  delaware  texas  new hampshire  illinois  maine  massachusetts  michigan  new york  ohio  pennsylvania  rhode island and virginia in the united states and the provinces of ontario and alberta in canada 
integrys energy services  on its own  or through certain of its subsidiaries  is registered to sell natural gas in the states of illinois  iowa  michigan  ohio  pennsylvania  new york and alberta  canada 
integrys energy services also sells natural gas in wisconsin where no license is required 
integrys energy services subsidiary  integrys energy services of canada corp  is registered to do business in the canadian provinces of alberta  british columbia  manitoba  nova scotia  ontario  quebec and saskatchewan 
integrys energy services  or certain of its subsidiaries  are also members of the following regional transmission operators and north american electric reliability council reliability regions independent electricity system operator located in ontario  electric reliability council of texas  iso new england  miso  new brunswick system operator  northern maine independent system administrator  new york independent system operator  and pjm interconnection 
integrys energy services consolidated its retail electric business in michigan by taking assignment of the retail power sale agreements of its michigan subsidiary  quest energy l 
lc  effective january  integrys energy services  as an authorized alternate electric supplier  will continue to participate in the electric choice program in michigan 
for more information on the legislative activity in michigan and ohio and its impact on integrys energy services  see the discussion on industry restructuring in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
all the ferc hydroelectric facility licenses held by integrys energy services subsidiaries are current 
the megawatt hydroelectric facility owned in new brunswick  canada  is not subject to licensing 
other matters customer segmentation although integrys energy services is not dependent on any one customer  a significant percentage of its retail sales volume is derived from industries related to paper and allied products  food and kindred products  chemicals and paint  and steel and foundries 
integrys energy services concentration of sales in any single market sector is decreasing as it expands into the illinois  texas and northeast united states retail electric markets and eastern canada retail natural gas markets 
seasonality integrys energy services believes that its business  in the aggregate  is not seasonal  even though certain products sell more heavily in some seasons than in others 
sales of natural gas generally peak in the winter months  while sales of electric energy generally peak in the summer months 
generally in the summer months  the demand for electric energy is high  which increases the price at which energy can be sold 
in periods of high residential fuel consumption  generally the winter months  the purchase price of oil and natural gas increases  which increases the production costs at integrys energy services gas and oil fired generation facilities 
integrys energy services business is volatile as a result of market conditions and the related market opportunities available to its customers 
competition integrys energy services is a nonregulated energy marketer that competes against regulated utilities  large energy trading companies and other energy marketers 
integrys energy services competes with other energy providers on the basis of price  reliability  service  financial strength  consumer convenience  performance and reputation 
the nonregulated energy market has seen a decrease in the number of large energy providers and there continues to be consolidation of small energy marketers 
the liquidity in the nonregulated energy market continues to improve with the increase of well capitalized wholesale market participants 
although this increases competition  it creates a more efficient market  creating more opportunities for integrys energy services in the nonregulated markets 
working capital currently  capital requirements of integrys energy services are provided through equity infusions  long term debt and short term debt by its parent company  integrys energy group 
the working capital needs of integrys energy services vary significantly over time due to volatility in commodity prices including margin calls  levels of natural gas inventories  the structure of wholesale transactions  the price of natural gas and alternative energy opportunities available to its customers 
integrys energy group provides guarantees for integrys energy services supply contracts 
these guarantees provide the credit support needed to participate in the nonregulated energy market

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  when making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us 
we may not successfully integrate pending or future acquisitions into our operations or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  we continue to pursue a disciplined acquisition strategy 
while we expect to identify cost savings and growth opportunities before we acquire companies or assets  we may not be able to achieve these anticipated benefits due to  among other things delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets  higher than expected costs or a need to allocate additional resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties  parameters imposed or delays caused by regulatory agencies  reliance on inaccurate assumptions in evaluating the expected benefits of a given acquisition  inability to retain key employees or customers of acquired companies  and assumption of liabilities not identified in the due diligence process 
these risks apply to our recently completed acquisition of aquila s michigan and minnesota natural gas distribution operations as well as our merger with peoples energy which closed on february  integrys energy group and peoples energy entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger would result in various benefits  including  among other things  synergies  cost savings and operating efficiencies 
although we expect to achieve these anticipated benefits of the merger  achieving them is subject to a number of uncertainties  including the extent to which regulatory authorities will require the combined company to share a disproportionate amount of the expected or achieved synergies of the merger with customers  any of which may have an adverse effect on the combined company  resolution of pending and future rate cases and negotiations including the recovery of deferred costs and other regulatory decisions impacting integrys energy group s regulated businesses  including the rate treatment of synergies and the cost to achieve those synergies  the ability of the two companies to combine certain of their operations or take advantage of expected growth opportunities  general market and economic conditions  general competitive factors in the marketplace  and higher than expected costs required to achieve the expected synergies 
no assurance can be given that these benefits will be achieved or  if achieved  the timing of their achievement 
failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs and decreases in the amount of expected revenues or net income of the combined company 
the integration of peoples energy following the merger will present significant challenges that may result in a decline in the anticipated potential benefits of the merger 
the merger involves the combination of two companies that previously operated independently 
the difficulties of combining the companies operations include  but are not limited to combining the best practices of two companies  including utility operations  non regulated energy marketing operations and staff functions  the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  systems and facilities  integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures  reducing the costs associated with each company s operations  and preserving important relationships of both companies and resolving potential conflicts that may arise 
the process of combining operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of the combined company s businesses and the possible loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the two companies operations could have an adverse effect on the business  results of operations  financial condition or prospects of the now combined company 
integrys energy group expects the merger to generate potential pre tax cost synergy savings of million for the combined company on an annualized basis by the end of the fifth full year of operations following completion of the merger excluding costs of integration 
these savings may not be realized within the time periods contemplated  or at all 
integrys energy group will incur significant transaction  merger related and restructuring costs in connection with the merger with peoples energy 
integrys energy group expects to incur costs associated with combining the operations of two companies  as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger 
integrys energy group will also incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the merger 
the estimated total cost of accomplishing the merger and achieving synergies and cost savings is approximately million in transaction and integration costs excluding internal labor costs  most of which will be incurred through the costs related to restructuring will be treated as a liability and will be included in the total purchase price or expensed as a cost of the ongoing results of operations  depending on the nature of the restructuring activity 
although integrys energy group expects the elimination of duplicative costs  as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses  to offset incremental transaction  merger related and restructuring costs over time  any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term  or at all 
integrys energy group has recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect the company s operating results 
the merger with peoples energy and the acquisition of gas distribution assets from aquila are accounted for as purchases by integrys energy group in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets and liabilities will be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition and added to those of integrys energy group 
the reported financial condition and results of operations of integrys energy group issued after completion of the merger will reflect peoples energy balances and results after completion of the merger  but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of peoples energy for periods prior to the merger 
following completion of the merger  the earnings of the combined company will reflect purchase accounting adjustments 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total purchase price will be allocated to peoples energy s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date the merger was completed 
the excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill 
we expect that the merger will result in a significant amount of goodwill based upon the application of purchase accounting 
to the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired  integrys energy group may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment 
such a potential impairment charge could have a material impact on the combined company s operating results 
integrys energy group s oil and natural gas producing operations involve many risks associated with estimates and assumptions used in making capital expenditure decisions 
in addition to the operational risks described above  the oil and natural gas drilling operations are also subject to the risk of not encountering commercially productive reservoirs and integrys energy group may not recover all or any portion of its investment in those wells 
drilling for natural gas and oil can be unprofitable  not only because of dry holes but also due to wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling  operating  production taxes and other costs 
in addition  estimating quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves is a complex process that involves significant interpretations of technical data and assumptions that result in reserve estimates being inherently imprecise 
integrys energy group utilizes a discount factor when estimating the value of its reserves  as prescribed by the sec  and this may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor  given actual interest rates and risks to which the production business or the natural gas and oil industry  in general  are subject 
any significant variations from the interpretations or assumptions used in the estimates or changes of conditions could cause the estimated quantities and net present value of the integrys energy group s reserves to differ materially from amounts disclosed in this document 
we are subject to changes in government regulation  which may have a negative impact on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state regulatory agencies  which significantly influences our operating environment and may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers 
in particular  the pscw  mpsc  mpuc  ferc  sec  epa  minnesota office of pipeline safety and the wdnr regulate many aspects of our utility operations  including siting and construction of facilities  conditions of service  the issuance of securities and the rates that we can charge customers 
we are required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from these agencies to operate our business 
on february   the merger with peoples energy was closed 
peoples energy s primary regulated natural gas distribution subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the icc 
the rates our regulated utilities are allowed to charge for their retail and wholesale services are some of the most important items influencing our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we are unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies 
changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may require us to incur additional expenses or change business operations  which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  federal regulatory reforms may produce unexpected changes and costs in the public utility industry 
we may not complete construction projects within estimated project costs 
wpsc is currently in the process of constructing the megawatt weston base load generation facility at an estimated cost of million including the coal trains 
wpsc is responsible for of these costs 
this and other projects also may be subject to joint ownership or operation agreements  completion of which will impact estimated project costs 
this a very large and complex construction project  subject to numerous unpredictable events that could affect our ability to timely complete construction within estimated costs 
we may not be able to meet these construction estimates due to  among other things fluctuating or unanticipated construction costs  supply delays  legal claims  and environmental regulation 
we may not utilize section k synthetic fuel production tax credits 
we have significantly reduced our consolidated federal income tax liability for the past several years through tax credits available to us under section k of the internal revenue code for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel from coal 
we have not fully utilized section k tax credits previously available to us 
our ability to fully utilize the section k tax credits available to us in connection with our interest in the production facility will depend on whether the amount of our federal taxable income and related income tax liability is sufficient to permit the use of such credits 
the internal revenue service strictly enforces compliance with all of the technical requirements of section k 
section k tax credits are currently scheduled to expire at the end of any disallowance of some or all of those tax credits could materially affect our tax obligations and may also result in a reduction of the level of synthetic fuel production at the facility  thus reducing the likelihood and amount of future payments from other participants in the project 
future tax legislation and internal revenue service review may also affect the value of the credits and of our share of the facility 
at this time  we cannot predict the potential for or the outcome of any internal revenue service review 
our operations are subject to risks beyond our control  including but not limited to weather  terrorist attacks or related acts of war 
our revenues are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas 
that demand can vary greatly based upon weather conditions  seasonality and temperature extremes  fluctuations in economic activity and growth in our regulated service areas  as well as areas in which our nonregulated subsidiaries operate  and the amount of additional energy available from current or new competitors 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities 
in addition  the cost of repairing damage to our facilities due to storms  natural disasters  wars  terrorist acts and other catastrophic events  in excess of reserves established for such repairs  may adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist activity and the high cost or potential unavailability of insurance to cover such terrorist activity may impact our results of operations and financial condition in unpredictable ways 
these actions could also result in disruptions of power and fuel markets 
in addition  our natural gas distribution system and pipelines could be directly or indirectly harmed by future terrorist activity 
costs of environmental compliance  liabilities  fines  penalties and litigation could exceed our estimates 
compliance with current and future federal and state environmental laws and regulations may result in increased capital  operating and other costs  including remediation and containment expenses and monitoring obligations 
integrys energy group cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up and compliance costs and the possibility that changes will be made to the current environmental laws and regulations 
any future changes in the interpretation of the clean air act s new source review provisions could potentially increase operating and maintenance costs substantially 
on march   the epa  adopted the clean air mercury rule  which is intended to reduce mercury emissions from coal fired generation plants 
the epa has also issued the clean air interstate rule requiring reductions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions 
in addition  the possibility exists of future regulation of greenhouse gases emitted from generation facilities 
integrys energy group cannot be certain how these rules will affect it 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties 
citizen groups that feel there are compliance issues not sufficiently enforced by environmental regulatory agencies may bring citizen enforcement actions against us 
such actions could seek penalties  injunctive relief and costs of litigation 
any change in our ability to sell electricity generated from our nonregulated facilities at market based rates may impact earnings 
the ferc has authorized us to sell generation from our nonregulated facilities at market prices 
the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market based rate authority 
if the ferc determines that the market is not workably competitive  that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates  it may require our nonregulated subsidiaries to sell power at a price based upon the costs incurred in producing the power 
our revenues and profit margins may be negatively affected by any reduction by the ferc of the rates we may receive 
fluctuating commodity prices may reduce regulated and nonregulated energy margins 
our regulated energy margins are directly affected by commodity costs related to coal  natural gas and other fuels used in the electric generation process 
the commodity price of market purchases of electricity also directly affects our regulated energy margins 
higher commodity prices increase energy prices and may impact customer demand for energy in the nonregulated market and increase counterparty risk 
this may stress margins at our nonregulated subsidiaries 
integrys energy services may experience increased expenses  including interest costs and uncollectibles  higher working capital requirements and possibly some reduction in volumes sold as a result of any increase in the cost of fuel or purchased power 
if market prices for electric energy decline below the cost of production at our nonregulated facilities  these units may be temporarily shut down and alternative sources of energy would need to be found to meet energy commitments economically 
a reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we cannot be sure that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
any downgrade could increase our borrowing costs  require us to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and possibly reduce the potential pool of creditors  increase our borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit facilities  limit our access to the commercial paper market  and limit the availability of adequate credit support for integrys energy services operations 
actual results could differ from estimates used to prepare our financial statements 
in preparing the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates 
for more information about these estimates and assumptions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in this annual report on form k 
the use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints 
we use derivative instruments  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  to manage our commodity and financial market risks 
in addition  we purchase and sell commodity based contracts in the natural gas and electric energy markets for trading purposes 
in the future  we could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of these contracts involves management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 
additionally  realized values could differ from values determined by management 
for additional information concerning derivatives and commodity based trading contracts  see note risk management activities in this annual report on form k 
we are subject to provisions that can limit merger and acquisition opportunities for our shareholders 
the wisconsin public utility holding company law precludes the acquisition of or more of the voting shares of a holding company of a wisconsin public utility unless the pscw has first determined that the acquisition is in the best interests of utility consumers  investors and the public 
those interests may  to some extent  be mutually exclusive 
this provision and other requirements of the wisconsin public utility holding company law may delay  or reduce the likelihood of  a sale or change of control thus reducing the likelihood that shareholders will receive a takeover premium for their shares 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and may prevent or delay a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company that is not approved by our board of directors  even if the shareholders believe that such events may be beneficial to their interests 
in addition  the wisconsin business corporation law contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or making more difficult attempts by others to obtain control of our company without the approval of our board of directors

our wholly owned subsidiaries at december  included four regulated utilities  wpsc  uppco  mguc  and merc 
another wholly owned subsidiary  wps resources capital corporation  is a holding company for our nonregulated subsidiary  integrys energy services 
strategic overview the focal point of integrys energy group s business plan is the creation of long term value for our shareholders and our customers through growth  operational excellence  asset management  risk management  and the continued emphasis on reliable  competitively priced  and environmentally sound energy and energy related services 
we are seeking growth of our regulated and nonregulated portfolio and placing an emphasis on regulated growth 
a discussion of the essential components of our business strategy is set forth below 
maintain and grow a strong regulated utility base we are focusing on growth in our regulated operations 
a strong regulated utility base is important in order to maintain a strong balance sheet  predictable cash flows  a desired risk profile  attractive dividends  and quality credit ratings  which are critical to our success 
integrys energy group believes the following recent developments have helped  or will help  maintain and grow its regulated utility base in february  we consummated the merger with peoples energy corporation 
upon completion of the merger  wps resources changed its name to integrys energy group 
as a result of the merger  peoples energy corporation is now a wholly owned subsidiary of integrys energy group 
see note  acquisitions and sales of assets  for more information 
wpsc is expanding its regulated generation fleet in order to meet growing electric demand and ensure continued reliability 
construction of the megawatt coal fired weston base load power plant located near wausau  wisconsin  continues in partnership with dpc 
in we completed the acquisition of aquila s natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota 
the addition of these regulated assets in close proximity to integrys energy group s existing regulated electric and natural gas operations in wisconsin and michigan has transitioned integrys energy group to a larger and stronger regional energy company 
we have invested in atc and received additional equity interest as consideration for funding a portion of the duluth  minnesota  to wausau  wisconsin  transmission line 
wpsc continues to invest in environmental projects to improve air quality and meet the requirements set by environmental regulators 
capital projects to construct and upgrade equipment to meet or exceed required environmental standards are planned each year 
integrate resources to provide operational excellence integrys energy group is committed to integrating resources of its regulated business units and also its nonregulated business units  while maintaining any and all applicable regulatory and legal restrictions 
this will provide the best value to all customers by leveraging the individual capabilities and expertise of each unit and assist in lowering costs for certain activities 
the merger with peoples energy will align the best practices and expertise of both companies and result in efficiencies by eliminating redundant and overlapping functions and systems 
the merger is expected to ultimately result in annual cost savings of approximately million in the corporate and regulated businesses and million in the nonregulated business 
we anticipate achieving these ongoing synergies approximately five years from the closing date of the merger 
one time costs to achieve the synergies are expected to be approximately million 
at our regulated business units  we are optimally sourcing work and combining resources to achieve best practices at wpsc  uppco  mguc  and merc in order to achieve operational excellence and sustainable value for customers and shareholders 
an initiative we call competitive excellence is being deployed across integrys energy group and its subsidiaries 
competitive excellence strives to eliminate work that does not provide value for customers 
this will create more efficient processes  improve the effectiveness of employees  and reduce costs 
competitive excellence will be utilized to help integrys energy group achieve the anticipated synergies in the merger with peoples energy 
strategically grow nonregulated businesses integrys energy services will grow its electric and natural gas business through strategic hiring and acquisitions  penetration in existing markets  and new product offerings by targeting growth in areas where it has market expertise 
integrys energy services also focuses on optimizing the operational efficiency of its existing portfolio of assets and pursues compatible development projects that strategically fit with its customer base and market expertise 
we expect our nonregulated operations to provide between and of our earnings  on average  in the future 
the merger with peoples energy combines the complementary nonregulated energy marketing businesses of both companies 
by combining the energy marketing businesses  we have more strategic opportunities to grow current nonregulated services by focusing on combined nonregulated retail and wholesale operations and disciplined risk management processes to create a stronger  more competitive  and better balanced growth platform for our nonregulated business 
in the fourth quarter of  integrys energy services hired experienced personnel and put in the infrastructure to establish a wholesale electric product offering in denver  colorado 
operations will begin in with a focus on the miso  pjm  ontario esco  and western systems coordinating council wscc markets 
integrys energy services began developing a retail electric product offering in the mid atlantic market pennsylvania  delaware  washington dc  maryland  and new jersey in having been presented with a good opportunity to leverage its infrastructure throughout the northeastern united states  integrys energy services hired experienced personnel in the mid atlantic region and will shortly begin signing up customers 
delivery of power to these customers is expected in the second quarter of integrys energy services currently has a market presence in this region by servicing wholesale electric customers 
in  integrys energy services began offering retail electric products to large commercial and industrial customers in illinois  new hampshire  and rhode island and delivered a total of  megawatt hours   megawatt hours  and  megawatt hours  respectively  to each in in  integrys energy services was only offering natural gas products and energy management services to customers in illinois and did not offer retail electric products in new hampshire and rhode island 
in september  integrys energy services won an illinois auction bid to serve additional customers beginning in  which will further expand integrys energy services wholesale electric business 
integrys energy services began developing a product offering in the texas retail electric market in late entry into texas  with its thriving market structure  provides integrys energy services with an opportunity to leverage the infrastructure and capability integrys energy services developed to provide products and services that it believes customers will value 
integrys energy services started to deliver power to these customers in july  and delivered a total of  megawatt hours to these customers in integrys energy services continues to increase both its customer base by signing up new enrollments and volumes in the texas retail electric market 
integrys energy services began marketing electric products to customers in massachusetts in and has had initial success in signing up commercial and industrial customers 
retail volumes contributed by massachusetts in were  megawatt hours 
integrys energy services continues to grow its retail natural gas business in canada and ohio through the addition of new customers 
place strong emphasis on asset and risk management our asset management strategy calls for the continuous assessment of our existing assets as well as a focus on the acquisition of assets that complement our existing business and strategy 
this strategy also calls for a focus on the disposition of assets  including plants and entire business units  which are either no longer strategic to ongoing operations  are not performing as needed  or the disposition of which would reduce our risk profile 
we maintain a portfolio approach to risk and earnings 
the combination of integrys energy group and peoples energy creates a larger  stronger  and more competitive regional energy company 
this merger  along with the acquisition of the michigan and minnesota natural gas distribution operations from aquila  diversifies the company s regulatory risk due to the expansion of utility operations to multiple jurisdictions 
on february   subsequent to its merger with peoples energy corporation  integrys energy group announced its commitment to the sale of peoples energy corporation s oil and natural gas production business 
the divesture of the oil and natural gas production business will lower integrys energy group s business risk profile and provide funds to reduce debt 
in  integrys energy services will develop a new landfill gas project  winnebago energy center development 
winnebago energy center development is a megawatt project near rockford  illinois  and will consist of installing gas cleanup equipment and engines to collect and burn landfill gas at the site to generate electricity 
integrys energy services will then sell the electricity in the pjm marketplace 
the project is initially expected to cost approximately million and  if we have initial project success  has the potential to expand to an megawatt facility in in january  integrys energy services sold wps niagara generation  llc to a subsidiary of us renewables group  llc for approximately million 
wps niagara generation  llc owned a megawatt niagara falls generation facility located in the niagara mowhawk frontier region in niagara falls  new york 
the pre tax gain on the sale was approximately million and was recorded in the first quarter of on july   integrys energy services completed the sale of sunbury generation  llc to corona power  llc  for approximately million 
sunbury generation s primary asset was the sunbury generation facility located in pennsylvania 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million in in addition  approximately million of cash tax benefits are expected to be accelerated over the next few years  depending on the use of the alternative minimum tax credits 
integrys energy services management had been evaluating sunbury s future since and after carefully reviewing alternatives and current business conditions  determined that the sale was the best alternative 
in april  a subsidiary of integrys energy group completed the sale of its one third interest in guardian pipeline  llc to northern border partners  lp for million 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of million which was recorded in the second quarter of we believe the sale provides a good opportunity to redeploy the proceeds into other investment opportunities  providing value to our shareholders 
in april  integrys energy services sold wps esi gas storage  llc  which owns a natural gas storage field located in the kimball township  st 
clair county  michigan  for approximately million and recognized a pre tax gain of million in the second quarter of integrys energy services utilized this facility primarily for structured wholesale natural gas transactions as natural gas storage spreads presented arbitrage opportunities 
integrys energy services was not actively marketing this facility for sale  but believed the price offered was above the value it would realize from continued ownership of the facility 
we continue to evaluate alternatives for the sale of real estate holdings we have identified as no longer needed for our operations 
our risk management strategy  in addition to asset risk management  includes the management of market  credit  and operational risk through the normal course of business 
forward purchases and sales of electric capacity  energy  natural gas  and other commodities allow for opportunities to secure prices in a volatile energy market 
business operations our regulated and nonregulated businesses have distinct competencies and business strategies 
they offer differing energy and energy related products and services  and experience a wide array of risks and challenges 
our regulated utilities derive revenues primarily from the purchase  production  distribution  and sale of electricity and the purchase  distribution  and sale of natural gas to retail customers 
the regulated utilities also provide wholesale electric service to numerous utilities and cooperatives for resale 
our nonregulated business offers natural gas  electric  and alternate fuel supplies  as well as energy management and consulting services  to retail and wholesale customers in various areas of the united states and portions of canada 
the market risks and challenges of our business are discussed in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
integrys energy services marketing and trading operations manage power and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments and sale of generation from power plants 
the table below discloses future natural gas and electric sales volumes under contract at integrys energy services as of december  integrys energy services expects that its ultimate sales volumes in and beyond will exceed the volumes shown in the table below as it continues to seek growth opportunities and as existing customers who do not have long term contracts continue to buy their short term requirements from integrys energy services 
forward contracted volumes at to to after wholesale sales volumes billion cubic feet retail sales volumes billion cubic feet total natural gas sales volumes wholesale sales volumes million kilowatt hours retail sales volumes million kilowatt hours total electric sales volumes these tables represent physical sales contracts for natural gas and electric power for delivery or settlement in future periods  however  there is a possibility that some of the contracted volumes reflected in the above table will be net settled 
management has no reason to believe that gross margins that will be generated by these contracts will vary significantly from those experienced historically 
for comparative purposes  the future natural gas and electric sales volumes under contract at december   are shown below 
the actual electric and natural gas sales volumes for the twelve months ended december   and are disclosed within results of operations integrys energy group  integrys energy services segment operations below 
forward contracted volumes at to to after wholesale sales volumes billion cubic feet retail sales volumes billion cubic feet total natural gas sales volumes wholesale sales volumes million kilowatt hours retail sales volumes million kilowatt hours total electric sales volumes this table represents physical sales contracts for natural gas and electric power for delivery or settlement in future periods  however  there is a possibility that some of the contracted volumes reflected in the above table could be net settled 
both retail and wholesale forward natural gas volumes under contract have increased as of december   compared to december  the increase in retail natural gas volumes under contract was driven by lower natural gas prices providing opportunities for integrys energy services to enter into supply contracts with customers in existing markets 
increased volatility in natural gas prices and high natural gas storage spreads future natural gas sales prices were higher than the near term price of natural gas increased the profitability of natural gas transactions  driving the increase in wholesale natural gas sales volumes under contract at december   compared to december  wholesale electric volumes under contract increased significantly at december  the increase in wholesale electric sales volumes was mostly related to the continued expansion of integrys energy services wholesale electric business  with a focus on physical  customer based purchase and sale agreements in areas where it has market expertise 
the emphasis integrys energy services is placing on its originated wholesale customer electric business is producing encouraging results and  as a result  integrys energy services has recently entered into numerous contracts to provide electricity to wholesale customers in the future 
retail electric sales volumes under contract have also increased at december  in  integrys energy services expanded its retail electric product offering in illinois  new hampshire  rhode island  massachusetts  and texas 
integrys energy services previously did not offer retail electric products  or offered few products  to these areas and expects to continue to build retail electric sales in these markets by continuing to attract new customers 
integrys energy services employs credit policies to mitigate its exposure to credit risk 
as a result of these credit policies  integrys energy services has not experienced significant write offs from its large wholesale counterparties to date 
the table below summarizes integrys energy services wholesale counterparty credit exposure  categorized by maturity date  as of december  at december   integrys energy services had exposure with one investment grade counterparty that was more than of net exposure 
net exposure with this counterparty was million and is included in the table below

investment grade counterparties are those with a senior unsecured moody s rating of baa or above or a standard poor s rating of bbb or above 
exposure considers netting of accounts receivable and accounts payable where netting agreements are in place as well as netting mark to market exposure 
exposure is before consideration of collateral from counterparties 
collateral  in the form of cash and letters of credit  received from counterparties totaled million at december   million from investment grade counterparties  and million from non rated counterparties 
non rated counterparties include stand alone companies  as well as unrated subsidiaries of rated companies without parental credit support 
these counterparties are subject to an internal credit review process 
results of operations integrys energy group compared with integrys energy group overview integrys energy group s and results of operations are shown in the following table integrys energy group s results millions  except share amounts change income available for common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share income available for common shareholders was million diluted earnings per share for the year ended december   compared to million diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  significant factors impacting the change in earnings and earnings per share were as follows and are discussed in more detail thereafter electric utility earnings increased million  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  fuel and purchased power costs that were less than what was recovered in rates during the year ended december   compared to fuel and purchased power costs that were more than were recovered in rates during the same period in the under collection in was primarily due to the impact the hurricanes had on natural gas prices  contributed an estimated million after tax  year over year increase in earnings 
in addition  a pscw ruling  which disallowed recovery of costs that were deferred related to the kewaunee nuclear plant outage as well as a portion of the loss on the kewaunee sale  resulted in the write off of million of regulatory assets in the write off of these regulatory assets in resulted in an after tax reduction in earnings in of approximately million 
the retail electric rate increases at both wpsc and uppco also had a positive year over year impact on earnings 
prior to its rate increase  uppco did not have a rate increase since these increases were partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions in  compared to  which had an estimated million year over year negative after tax impact on electric utility earnings 
results from natural gas utility operations decreased million  from earnings of million for the year ended december   to a net loss of million in a combined net loss of approximately million related to the results of operations of mguc natural gas distribution operations acquired on april  and merc natural gas distribution operations acquired on july  
included in the net loss incurred by mguc and merc were million million after tax of external pre tax transition costs that were incurred by these natural gas utilities 
the net loss recognized at mguc and merc in excess of transition costs incurred can be attributed to not owning these operations during the heating season from january through march and warmer than normal weather conditions during the last few months of from the acquisition date through december   actual heating degree days were and below normal for mguc and merc  respectively 
earnings at wpsc s natural gas utility also decreased approximately million  driven by unfavorable weather conditions and customer conservation efforts 
integrys energy services earnings decreased million  from million for the year ended december   to million for the same period in lower earnings were driven by an million million after tax increase in interest expense due to higher working capital requirements primarily related to growth in integrys energy services natural gas operations  a million million after tax increase in miscellaneous expenses primarily related to increased tons procured from integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility and the fact that integrys energy services received no royalty payments from this investment in  and a million after tax decrease in income from discontinued operations 
these factors were partially offset by a million million after tax increase in margin including an million pre tax decrease in gains on derivative instruments used to protect the value of section k tax credits  a million million after tax decrease in operating expenses primarily related to the recognition of a million pre tax gain on the sale of integrys energy services kimball storage field in the second quarter of  and a million increase in section k federal tax credits recognized from integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in integrys energy group s notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed analysis of how integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility impacted results of operations 
results from holding company and other segment operations decreased million  from earnings of million for the year ended december   to earnings of million for the same period in external transition expenses of million were recorded in related to consulting fees in conjunction with our merger with peoples energy 
diluted earnings per share was impacted by the items discussed above as well as an increase of million shares in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of integrys energy group s common stock for the year ended december   compared to integrys energy group issued million shares of common stock through a public offering in november and also issued million shares of common stock in may in order to settle its forward equity agreement with an affiliate of jp morgan securities  inc additional shares were also issued under the stock investment plan and certain stock based employee benefit plans 
overview of utility operations in  utility operations included the electric utility segment  consisting of the electric operations of wpsc and uppco  and the gas utility segment  consisting of the natural gas operations of wpsc  mguc  and merc 
electric utility segment operations integrys energy group s electric utility year ended december  segment results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power costs margins sales in kilowatt hours residential commercial and industrial wholesale other total sales in kilowatt hours weather wpsc heating degree days actual cooling degree days actual electric utility revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  largely due to the approved electric rate increases for wpsc and uppco retail electric customers see note  regulatory environment  in integrys energy group s notes to consolidated financial statements for more information related to these rate increases and rate increases for wpsc s wholesale customers resulting from the formula rate mechanism in place for these customers 
electric sales volumes also increased  primarily related to a increase in sales volumes to wholesale customers due to higher demand and new wholesale contracts 
unfavorable weather conditions during both the heating and cooling seasons for the year ended december   compared to  partially offset the increases discussed above 
the electric utility margin decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the decrease in the electric utility margin was driven by a million decrease in wpsc s electric margin  primarily related to the sale of kewaunee on july   and the related power purchase agreement  partially offset by an approximate million increase in uppco s margin driven by its first retail electric rate increase since 
excluding the million increase in fixed payments made to dominion energy kewaunee during the year ended december   wpsc s electric utility margin increased million  driven by the retail electric and wholesale rate increases discussed above 
in addition  fuel and purchased power costs were less than were recovered in rates during the year ended december   compared to fuel and purchased power costs that were more than were recovered in rates during the same period in the under collection in was primarily due to the impact the hurricanes had on natural gas prices  which had an estimated million positive year over year impact on margin 
the margin was also positively impacted by higher wholesale electric sales volumes  driven by higher demand from existing customers and new wholesale customer contracts 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in margin related to the refund to retail customers and the accrual for the refund to wholesale customers of a portion of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund 
pursuant to regulatory accounting  the decrease in margin related to this refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in operating and maintenance expense as explained below and  therefore  did not have an impact on earnings 
unfavorable weather conditions during both the heating and cooling seasons also negatively impacted margin by an estimated million 
gas utility segment operations integrys energy group s year ended december  gas utility segment results millions change revenues purchased natural gas costs margins throughput in therms residential commercial and industrial interruptible interdepartmental transport total sales in therms weather wpsc heating degree days actual cooling degree days actual natural gas utility revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to  due to the acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in michigan by mguc on april   and the acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in minnesota by merc on july  these acquisitions contributed approximately million to natural gas utility revenue and approximately million therms to natural gas throughput volumes during the year ended december  wpsc s natural gas utility revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million in lower natural gas revenues at wpsc were driven by a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes  primarily related to a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes to the electric utility for electric generation and a decrease in throughput volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers 
the decrease in throughput volumes to the electric utility resulted from a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its natural gas fired peaking generation units during the year ended december   compared to  and from higher dispatch of these peaking generation units by miso in for reliability purposes 
the decrease in throughput volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers was also driven by unfavorable weather conditions in compared to  as well as customer conservation efforts 
particularly at the beginning of  customers were taking measures to conserve energy as a result of the high natural gas prices 
for the year ended december   natural gas prices were actually lower on a per unit basis  compared to  resulting from a large decline in the price of natural gas in the second half of  also contributing to the decrease in natural gas revenue 
partially offsetting the decrease in wpsc s natural gas utility revenue was the natural gas rate increase at wpsc see note  regulatory environment  in integrys energy group s notes to consolidated financial statements for more information related to this rate increase 
the natural gas utility margin increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the combined margin provided by mguc and merc was approximately million  while wpsc s natural gas utility margin decreased million 
as discussed in more detail above  a decrease in throughput volumes to higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers was partially offset by the natural gas rate increase 
the decrease in natural gas volumes sold to the electric utility did not have a significant impact on wpsc s natural gas utility margin as sales to the electric utility have very low margins 
overview of integrys energy services operations integrys energy services offers natural gas  electric  and alternative fuel supplies  as well as asset management and consulting services  to retail and wholesale customers in the midwest and northeastern united states  texas  and portions of canada adjacent to the markets integrys energy services serves in the united states 
wholesale electric products and services are offered in developed markets throughout the united states 
integrys energy services also owns several merchant generation plants  primarily in the midwest and northeastern united states and adjacent portions of canada 
operationally  was very productive for integrys energy services 
energy prices fell considerably in the latter half of the year  which created opportunities for integrys energy services to further penetrate existing markets and sign up customers in new markets  adding value to integrys energy services retail electric and retail natural gas portfolios 
through the use of derivative instruments and other supply contracts  integrys energy services was able to secure margin on future sales to these customers  which will be recognized in future periods 
millions except natural gas sales volumes change nonregulated revenues nonregulated cost of fuel  natural gas  and purchased power margins margin detail electric and other margins other margins mostly relate to mark to market and realized losses on oil options of million during  compared to mark to market and realized gains on oil hedges of million during natural gas margins gross volumes includes volumes both physically delivered and net settled wholesale electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours retail electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours wholesale natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet retail natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet physical volumes includes only transactions settled physically for the periods shown wholesale electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours retail electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours wholesale natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet retail natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet represents gross physical volumes integrys energy services revenue decreased million for the year ended december   compared to  primarily related to a decrease in both physical retail and wholesale electric sales volumes and a decrease in energy prices during the latter half of the decrease in physical retail electric sales volumes was driven by a decrease in retail electric sales volumes in ohio and michigan 
integrys energy services retail electric aggregation sales in ohio ended on december   with the expiration of integrys energy services contracts with ohio aggregation customers 
regarding michigan retail electric operations  integrys energy services had many customers return to their utility supplier beginning in and continuing into as a result of high wholesale energy prices and utility tariff changes  which significantly lowered the savings that customers could obtain from contracting with non utility suppliers 
in other areas  lower wholesale energy prices in the latter half of allowed integrys energy services to sign up a significant number of new retail customers  which will increase sales and contribute to margin in later years 
the lower prices also increase the likelihood that integrys energy services may be able to re contract some of its michigan retail electric business 
the decrease in physically settled wholesale electric sales volumes was driven by a trend toward more financially settled transactions in  compared to integrys energy services margins increased million  from million for the year ended december   to million for many items contributed to the year over year net increase in margin and  as a result  a table has been provided to summarize significant changes 
variances included under other significant items in the table below are generally related to the timing of gain and loss recognition on certain transactions 
all variances depicted in the table are discussed in more detail below the table 
millions except natural gas sales volumes increase decrease in margin in compared to electric and other margins realized gains on structured origination contracts realized retail electric margin all other wholesale electric operations other significant items oil option activity retail mark to market activity liquidation of an electric supply contract in net decrease in electric and other margins natural gas margins realized natural gas margins other significant items mass market supply options spot to forward differential other mark to market activity net increase in natural gas margins net increase in integrys energy services margin integrys energy services electric and other margins decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the following items were the most significant contributors to the net change in integrys energy services electric and other margins realized gains on structured origination contracts integrys energy services electric and other margin increased million for the year ended december   compared to  due to realized gains from origination contracts involving the sale of energy through structured transactions to wholesale customers in the midwest and northeastern united states 
these origination contracts were not in place in integrys energy services continues to expand its wholesale origination capabilities with a focus on physical  customer based purchase and sale agreements in areas where it has market expertise 
integrys energy services provided products to large origination customers desiring to take advantage of falling energy prices 
realized retail electric margin the realized margin from retail electric operations decreased million  driven by an million decrease in margin from retail electric operations in ohio and a million decrease in margin from retail electric operations in northern maine 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in margin from retail electric operations in michigan  a million increase in margin from retail electric operations in new york  and a positive margin contribution from retail electric operations in texas and illinois 
integrys energy services retail electric aggregation sales in ohio ended on december   with the expiration of integrys energy services contracts with ohio aggregation customers 
integrys energy services remains prepared to offer future retail electric service in ohio as the regulatory climate and market conditions allow 
the decrease in margin from operations in northern maine was driven by higher supply costs in part tied to diesel fuel prices 
a portion of the electricity purchased by integrys energy services to supply customers in northern maine is derived from burning wood chips 
the cost to transport wood chips  as well as the operating costs of the machine utilized to make the wood chips  were negatively impacted by high diesel fuel prices 
in  integrys energy services shared in this diesel fuel exposure with the generation supplier 
integrys energy services was awarded a new contract to serve customers in northern maine that began on january  fuel sharing was not contemplated in any of the related energy supply contracts that will be utilized to serve northern maine load in the increase in margin from retail electric operations in michigan was driven by the elimination of the seams elimination charge adjustment seca effective march  see note  regulatory environment  in integrys energy group s notes to consolidated financial statements for more information related to seca 
integrys energy services began developing a product offering in the texas retail electric market in entry into texas  with its thriving market structure  provides integrys energy services with an opportunity to leverage the infrastructure and capability it developed 
integrys energy services started to deliver power to these customers in july integrys energy services continues to increase both its customer base by contracting new enrollments and volumes in the texas retail electric market 
in  integrys energy services began offering retail electric products to large commercial and industrial customers in illinois 
in  integrys energy services was only offering natural gas products and energy management services to customers in illinois 
all other wholesale electric operations a million increase in margin from other wholesale electric operations was driven by an increase in net realized and unrealized gains related to trading activities utilized to optimize the value of integrys energy services merchant generation fleet and customer supply portfolios 
as part of its trading activities  integrys energy services seeks to generate profits from the volatility of the price of electricity  by purchasing or selling various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts  options  financial transmission rights  and capacity contracts in established wholesale markets primarily in the northeastern portion of the united states where integrys energy services has market expertise  under risk management policies set by management and approved by integrys energy group s board of directors 
integrys energy services also seeks to maximize the value of its generation and customer supply portfolios to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from these assets through the use of various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts  options  financial transmission rights  and capacity contracts 
period by period variability in the margin contributed by integrys energy services optimization strategies and trading activities is expected due to constantly changing market conditions and differences in the timing of gains and losses recognized on derivative and non derivative contracts  as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
using a diverse mix of products and markets  combined with disciplined execution and exit strategies  has allowed integrys energy services to consistently generate economic value and earnings from these activities while staying within the value at risk var limits authorized by integrys energy group s board of directors 
for more information on var  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
oil option activity a decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments utilized to protect the value of a portion of integrys energy services section k federal tax credits in and contributed million to the decrease in its electric and other margin 
the derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments and  as a result  changes in the fair value are recorded currently in earnings 
the decrease in the fair value of these instruments in reflects declining oil prices 
declining prices are generally favorable as they improve the overall profitability of the unhedged portion of our synthetic fuel operations  and present opportunities to produce more synthetic fuel while mitigating the risk of future oil price increases through the use of derivative instruments 
the benefit from section k federal tax credits during a year is primarily based upon estimated annual synthetic fuel production levels  the ability to sell the synthetic fuel that is produced  annual taxable earnings  and any impact annual oil prices may have on the realization of section k federal tax credits 
this results in mark to market gains or losses being recognized in different years  compared to any tax credit phase outs that may be recognized

these mark to market gains and losses will reverse as the related customer sales contracts settle 
due to the mix of contracts that require mark to market accounting and those that do not  integrys energy services generally experiences mark to market losses on supply contracts in periods of declining wholesale prices and mark to market gains in periods of increasing wholesale prices 
declining prices are generally favorable as they increase integrys energy services ability to offer customers contracts that are both favorably priced and lower than the prices offered by regulated utilities  but can cause short term volatility in earnings 
liquidation of an electric supply contract in in the fourth quarter of  an electricity supplier exiting the wholesale market in maine requested that integrys energy services liquidate a firm contract to buy power in and at that time  integrys energy services recognized an million gain related to the liquidation of the contract and entered into a new contract with another supplier for firm power in and to supply its customers in maine 
the cost to purchase power under the new contract is more than the cost under the liquidated contract 
as a result of the termination of this contract  purchased power costs to serve customers in maine were million higher for the year ended december   and will be slightly higher than the original contracted amount in the liquidation of this contract had a million negative impact on the year over year change in the electric and other margin  resulting from higher purchased power costs recorded under the new contract in  compared to a gain recognized on the liquidation of the original contract in realized natural gas margins realized natural gas margins increased million  from million in to million in the majority of this increase  million  related to an increase in retail natural gas margin  driven by continued expansion of integrys energy services canadian retail operations including higher sales volumes to existing customers as well as new customer additions 
margins from retail natural gas operations in wisconsin  michigan  and illinois also increased  as integrys energy services was able to better manage supply to these customers  aided by favorable market conditions 
the remaining million increase in realized natural gas margins related to wholesale operations  driven by an increase in structured wholesale natural gas transactions attributed to an increase in the volatility of the price of natural gas as well as high natural gas storage spreads during most of mass market supply options options utilized to manage supply costs for mass market customers  which expire in varying months through may  had an million negative year over year impact on integrys energy services natural gas margin

operating and maintenance related to the kewaunee nuclear plant decreased approximately million  driven by the sale of this facility in july the decrease in operating and maintenance expense related to kewaunee did not have a significant impact on income available for common shareholders as wpsc is still purchasing power from this facility in the same amount as its original ownership interest 
the cost of the power is included as a component of utility cost of fuel  natural gas  and purchased power 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw concluded that only half of the loss related to the sale of kewaunee could be collected from ratepayers 
as a result  in wpsc wrote off million of the regulatory asset established for the loss on the sale of kewaunee  creating a corresponding year over year decrease in operating expenses 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw also disallowed recovery of increased operating and maintenance expenses related to the extended outage at kewaunee  resulting in a million write off in of previously deferred costs  creating a corresponding year over year decrease in operating expenses 
salaries and employee benefits also decreased in part due to the sale of kewaunee in software amortization increased million  driven by the late implementation of a new customer billing system 
excluding kewaunee  maintenance expenses at the electric utility segment were up million 
planned maintenance was required on certain combustion turbines  and maintenance expense related to electric distribution assets also increased 
electric transmission expense increased million 
operating and maintenance expense at the natural gas utility segment increased million  from million in  to million in the increase in operating and maintenance expense at the natural gas utility segment was driven by million of combined operating and maintenance expense incurred by mguc and merc 
of the million of operating and maintenance expense incurred by mguc and merc during the year ended december   million related to external transition expenses  primarily for the start up of outsourcing activities and other legal and consulting fees 
partially offsetting the increase in operating and maintenance expenses related to mguc and merc  operating expenses related to wpsc s natural gas operations decreased  driven by decreases in various employee benefit related expenses 
operating and maintenance expenses at integrys energy services decreased million  from million for the year ended december   to million for the same period in  driven primarily by a million pre tax gain recognized on the sale of integrys energy services kimball storage field in the second quarter of this gain was partially offset by higher payroll and benefit costs related to an increase in the number of employees as a result of continued business expansion activities 
the remaining increase in operating and maintenance expense relates to holding company and other segment operations and was driven by legal and consulting expenses related to business expansion activities  primarily attributed to our merger with peoples energy 
depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense decreased million  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  as follows millions change electric utility segment gas utility segment integrys energy services holding company and other segment the million year over year decrease in depreciation expense at the electric utility segment was driven by approximately million of decommissioning expense that was recorded during  compared to no decommissioning expense recorded in  and a million decrease in depreciation expense resulting from the sale of kewaunee in july subsequent to the sale of kewaunee  decommissioning expense is no longer recorded 
in  realized gains on decommissioning trust assets were substantially offset by decommissioning expense pursuant to regulatory practice see analysis of other income expense below 
an increase in depreciation expense related to continued capital investment at the electric utility partially offset the overall decrease in depreciation and decommissioning expense 
the million year over year increase in depreciation expense at the gas utility segment was driven by a combined million of depreciation expense recorded by mguc and merc for the year ended december  continued capital investment at wpsc s natural gas utility also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense 
taxes other than income taxes other than income increased million  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  as follows millions change electric utility segment gas utility segment integrys energy services holding company and other segment the increase in taxes other than income was driven by million of taxes other than income recorded by mguc and merc  primarily related to property taxes  and a million increase in taxes other than income recorded by the electric utility  driven by an increase in gross receipts tax that resulted from an increase in electric utility revenue 
other income expense integrys energy group s year ended december  other income expense millions change miscellaneous income interest expense minority interest other expense income miscellaneous income miscellaneous income decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the decrease in miscellaneous income was driven by approximately million of realized gains on nuclear decommissioning trust assets recorded during the year ended december  pursuant to regulatory practice  the increase in miscellaneous income related to these realized gains was substantially offset by a corresponding increase in decommissioning expense in integrys energy services equity investment in a synthetic fuel facility contributed an additional million decrease in miscellaneous income  driven by additional synthetic fuel production procured in from our partners in this facility see note  commitments and contingencies  in integrys energy group s notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility 
finally  pre tax gains recognized on land sales decreased million  from million in to million in these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in pre tax equity earnings from atc and a million pre tax gain recognized from the sale of integrys energy group s one third interest in guardian pipeline  llc 
interest expense interest expense increased million in  compared to  due primarily to an increase in the average amount of both short term and long term debt outstanding and higher average short term interest rates 
during  borrowings were primarily utilized to fund the purchase of natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota  the construction of weston  and for working capital requirements at integrys energy services 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate was driven by a higher effective state tax rate  primarily related to the acquisition of regulated natural gas operations in minnesota and also due to a loss in value of various state net operating loss carryforwards 
partially offsetting these decreases  section k federal tax credits recognized increased million in  compared to we recognized the tax benefit of million of section k federal tax credits in  compared to million in  from the production and sale of synthetic fuel 
section k federal tax credits recognized increased despite an anticipated phase out due to additional tons of synthetic fuel we were able to procure from our partners in the synthetic fuel facility  who curtailed their production in due to high oil prices 
integrys energy services economically hedged the risk associated with this additional production 
discontinued operations  net of tax discontinued operations  net of tax  decreased million  from after tax income of million in to after tax income of million in discontinued operations  net of tax  related to sunbury decreased million  from income of million in to income of million in the decrease was driven by a million million after tax decrease in gross margin  partially offset by a million after tax gain recognized on the sale of sunbury  and a million million after tax decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in gross margin at sunbury was due in part to the fact that sunbury was available for operation during the entire year ended december   compared to a partial year of operations in as this facility was sold in july gross margin also decreased as a result of the higher cost of fuel and emission allowances combined with lower energy prices prior to the sale in  compared to the comparable period in since the sale of its allocated emission allowances in the second quarter of  sunbury purchased emission allowances required for operation at market prices 
the decrease in interest expense was driven by million of interest expense recognized in the second quarter of related to the termination of an interest rate swap pertaining to sunbury s non recourse debt obligation  as well as the recognition of interest expense on the non recourse debt prior to the restructuring of this debt in the second quarter of the restructuring of the sunbury debt to a integrys energy group obligation in june triggered the recognition of interest expense equivalent to the mark to market value of the swap at the date of restructuring 
discontinued operations  net of tax  related to wps niagara generation  llc decreased million  from income of million in to income of million in the decrease in income generated from wps niagara generation was mostly due to a decrease in the average price per megawatt sold from this facility in compared to for more information on discontinued operations  see note  discontinued operations  in integrys energy group s notes to consolidated financial statements 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principles in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies when companies are required to recognize conditional legal asset retirement obligations that result from the acquisition  construction  and normal operation of a long lived asset 
because the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations has been interpreted differently between companies  sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  had been inconsistently applied in practice 
the adoption of interpretation no 
at integrys energy services on december   resulted in a negative million after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in  related to recording a liability for asbestos remediation at certain of integrys energy services generation plants 
for the utility segments of integrys energy group  we concluded it was probable that any differences between expenses under interpretation no 
and expenses currently recovered through customer rates will be recoverable in future customer rates 
accordingly  the adoption of this statement had no impact on the utility segment s income 
compared with integrys energy group overview integrys energy group s and results of operations are shown in the following table integrys energy group s results millions  except share amounts change income available for common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share income available for common shareholders was million diluted earnings per share for the year ended december   compared to million diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  significant factors impacting the change in earnings and earnings per share are as follows and are discussed in more detail below integrys energy services earnings increased million  for the year ended december   compared to higher earnings were driven by the million increase in margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses  a million after tax increase in results from discontinued operations  a million decrease in section k federal tax credits  and the negative impact of a million after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle recorded in earnings at the holding company and other segment decreased million in  compared to  driven by lower gains from land sales  an income tax benefit recognized in from the donation of land to the wdnr  and an increase in interest expense 
these items were partially offset by higher equity earnings from our investment in atc 
electric utility earnings decreased million for the year ended december   compared to electric utility earnings were negatively impacted by fuel and purchased power costs that were million in excess of what wpsc was allowed to recover from customers due to inefficiencies in the fuel recovery process million related to retail customers and million related to wholesale customers 
in addition  the pscw s ruling in the rate case  which disallowed recovery of costs that were deferred related to the kewaunee nuclear plant outage and a portion of the loss on the kewaunee sale  resulted in the write off of million of regulatory assets 
gas utility earnings for the year ended december  decreased million  primarily due to an increase in operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation expense incurred by the gas utility 
the change in diluted earnings per share was also impacted by an increase of million shares in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of integrys energy group s common stock for the year ended december   compared to the same period in additional shares were issued in under the stock investment plan and certain stock based employee benefit plans 
integrys energy group s issuance of million additional shares of common stock through a public offering in november also contributed to the increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
overview of utility operations income available for common shareholders attributable to the electric utility segment was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  income available for common shareholders attributable to the gas utility segment was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  electric utility segment operations integrys energy group s electric utility segment results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power costs margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric utility revenue increased largely due to an approved electric rate increase for wpsc s wisconsin retail customers and an increase in electric sales volumes 
on december   the pscw approved a retail electric rate increase of million  effective january  the rate increase was required primarily to recover increased costs related to fuel and purchased power  the construction of the weston power plant  and benefit costs 
electric sales volumes increased  primarily due to significantly warmer weather during the cooling season  compared to the same period in  and new power sales agreements that were entered into with wholesale customers 
as a result of the warm weather  both wpsc and uppco set all time records for peak electric demand in the second and third quarters of the electric utility margin decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in margin can be attributed to a million decrease in wpsc s electric margin  which was largely driven by the sale of kewaunee on july   and the related power purchase agreement 
prior to the sale of kewaunee  only nuclear fuel expense was reported as a component of fuel and purchased power costs 
subsequent to the sale  all payments to dominion for power purchased from kewaunee are reported as a component of fuel and purchased power costs 
these include both variable payments for energy delivered and fixed payments 
as a result of the sale  wpsc no longer incurs operating and maintenance expense  depreciation and decommissioning expense  or interest expense for kewaunee 
excluding the million of fixed payments made to dominion in  wpsc s electric utility margin increased million compared to this increase in margin was primarily related to the approved retail electric rate increase discussed above and the warm summer weather conditions  partially offset by higher fuel and purchased power costs associated with high natural gas prices and the pscw s disallowance of certain costs in its decision on the rate case for wpsc these costs were previously approved for deferral 
fuel and purchased power costs incurred in exceeded the amount recovered from ratepayers by million of which million related to wisconsin retail customers and million related to wholesale customers  negatively impacting margin 
the increase in fuel and purchased power costs resulted primarily from the destruction of certain natural gas production facilities in the gulf of mexico by hurricanes in the third quarter of  driving up the per unit cost of natural gas used in generation 
the quantity of power generated from wpsc s natural gas fired units was also up over the prior year  driven by the warm summer weather conditions experienced during  increased dispatch by the miso for reliability purposes  and purchases through a purchase power agreement from the fox energy center which began operating in june 
certain costs related to the miso were approved for deferral 
authorization was requested from the pscw to defer increased natural gas costs related to the hurricanes  but this request was denied  leaving the wisconsin fuel recovery mechanism as the only option for recovery 
however  because of the way the wisconsin fuel recovery mechanism works  the increase in fuel and purchased power costs primarily related to the combination of rising natural gas prices caused by the hurricanes and the increase in natural gas fired generation were essentially unrecoverable since they were incurred late in the year 
to mitigate the risk of unrecoverable fuel costs in due to market price volatility  wpsc employed risk management techniques pursuant to its risk policy approved by the pscw  including the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options 
the pscw also disallowed recovery of million of increased fuel and purchased power costs related to an extended outage at kewaunee in  resulting in this deferral being written off in the fourth quarter of electric utility earnings decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the decrease in earnings resulted from the high fuel and purchased power costs that wpsc was unable to recover from its wisconsin retail and wholesale customers  the pscw s disallowance of previously deferred costs related to kewaunee  and an increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
gas utility segment operations integrys energy group s gas utility segment results millions change revenues purchased natural gas costs margins throughput in therms gas utility revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to gas utility revenue increased primarily as a result of an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas  a natural gas rate increase  and higher natural gas throughput volumes 
natural gas costs increased on a per unit basis for the year ended december   compared to following regulatory practice  wpsc passes changes in the total cost of natural gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause  as allowed by the pscw and the mpsc 
the pscw issued an order authorizing a natural gas rate increase of million  effective january  the rate increase was primarily driven by higher benefit costs and the cost of natural gas distribution system improvements 
natural gas throughput volumes increased  driven by an increase in interdepartmental sales from the natural gas utility to the electric utility as a result of increased generation from combustion turbines 
higher natural gas throughput volumes from interdepartmental sales to the electric utility were partially offset by lower natural gas throughput volumes to residential customers  driven by milder weather conditions in  compared to wpsc also believes customers were taking measures to conserve energy as a result of the high natural gas prices 
the natural gas utility margin increased million for the year ended december   compared to the higher natural gas utility margin was largely due to the rate increase mentioned above 
the increase in interdepartmental sales volumes to wpsc s electric utility also had a positive impact on the natural gas margin 
gas utility earnings for the year ended december   decreased million  primarily due to an increase in operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation expense incurred by the gas utility 
overview of integrys energy services operations income available for common shareholders attributable to integrys energy services was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  millions except natural gas sales volumes change nonregulated revenues nonregulated cost of fuel  natural gas  and purchased power margins wholesale natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet retail natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet wholesale electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours retail electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours represents gross physical volumes revenues integrys energy services revenue increased billion for the year ended december   compared to natural gas revenue increased billion  driven by a increase in the average price of natural gas  higher natural gas throughput volumes in canada  and an increase in structured natural gas transactions with wholesale customers 
electric revenue increased approximately million  largely due to an million increase in revenue from retail electric operations in new york  resulting from an increase in the per unit price of electricity sold and a increase in sales volumes the new york business had its first full year of operation in 
revenue also increased due to an increase in structured energy transactions 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in wholesale electric revenue related to integrys energy services prior participation in the new jersey basic generation services program  which ended on may   and a million decrease in revenue from retail electric operations in michigan  driven by lower sales volumes in margins integrys energy services margins increased million  from million for the year ended december   to million for many items contributed to the year over year net increase in margin and  as a result  a table has been provided to summarize significant changes 
variances included under other significant items in the table below are related to the timing of gain and loss recognition on certain transactions pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles and gains and losses that do not frequently occur in integrys energy services business 
all variances depicted in the table are discussed in more detail below 
millions except natural gas sales volumes increase decrease in margin in compared to electric and other margins physical asset management new york retail michigan retail all other electric operations other significant items oil option activity liquidation of electric purchase contract net increase in electric and other margins natural gas margins gas margins principally canada  michigan  and wisconsin retail markets other significant items counterparty settlement unrealized gain on ohio options spot to forward differential net increase in natural gas margins net increase in integrys energy services margin integrys energy services electric and other margins increased million for the year ended december   compared to the following items were the most significant contributors to the net change in integrys energy services electric and other margins physical asset management optimization strategies related to integrys energy services generation facilities resulted in a million increase in margin 
the profitability and volume of transactions related to integrys energy services optimization strategies were higher due to increased variability in the price of energy in compared to in the first quarter of  integrys energy services first implemented the portfolio optimization strategies to optimize the value of the merchant generation fleet to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from these assets through the use of various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts and options 
new york retail the first full year of retail electric operations in new york as discussed in revenues above contributed million to the overall margin increase 
michigan retail the margin contributed by retail electric operations in michigan decreased million in  compared to higher transmission related charges resulting from the seams elimination charge adjustment  which was implemented on december   and continued through march  as ordered by the ferc  negatively impacted the margin from retail electric operations in michigan 
in addition  tariff changes granted to the regulated utilities in michigan in  coupled with high wholesale energy prices  have significantly lowered the savings customers can obtain from contracting with non utility suppliers 
the tariff changes enable michigan utilities to charge a fee to electric customers choosing non utility suppliers in order to recover certain stranded costs 
integrys energy services has experienced significant customer attrition as a result of the tariff changes and higher wholesale prices 
customer attrition  high wholesale energy prices  and the tariff changes have also negatively impacted the margin from retail electric operations in michigan 
all other electric operations a million increase in margin was primarily related to realized and unrealized gains on structured power transactions in the latter half of these transactions included the execution of purchase and sales contracts with municipalities  merchant generators  retail aggregators  and other power marketers made possible by changing market conditions 
additionally  integrys energy services experienced increased margins from its merchant generation fleet as a result of increased dispatch levels due to improved market conditions 
period by period variability in the margin contributed by structured transactions and the merchant generation fleet is expected due to constantly changing market conditions and the timing of gain and loss recognition on certain transactions pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles 
oil option activity mark to market gains recognized in on derivative instruments utilized to protect the value of a portion of integrys energy services section k federal tax credits in and contributed million to the increase in margin 
the derivative contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments and  as a result  changes in the fair value are recorded currently in earnings 
this results in mark to market gains or losses being recognized in different periods  compared to any offsetting tax credit phase outs that may occur 
for the year ended december   unrealized mark to market gains of million and million were recognized for the and oil options  respectively  while no tax credit phase out was recognized because and tax credits will not be recognized until fuel is produced and sold in those periods 
hedges of exposure contributed an additional million increase in margin million gain on settlement  net of million of premium amortization 
liquidation of electric purchase contract in  an electricity supplier exiting the wholesale market in maine forced integrys energy services to liquidate a firm contract to buy power in and integrys energy services recognized a gain of million related to the liquidation of this contract  and entered into a new contract with another supplier for firm power in and to supply its customers in maine 
the cost to purchase power under the new contract will be more than the cost under the liquidated contract 
as a result  purchased power costs will be million higher in and slightly higher than the original contracted amount in  substantially offsetting the gain 
the natural gas margin at integrys energy services increased million for the year ended december   compared to the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in integrys energy services electric margin gas margins principally canada  michigan  and wisconsin retail major contributors to growth in integrys energy services gas margins included the continued expansion of our canadian retail and wholesale business  as well as increased margins from our retail operations in michigan and wisconsin 
counterparty settlement the natural gas margin increased million as a result of a favorable settlement with a counterparty 
unrealized gain on ohio options a million mark to market gain on options utilized to manage supply costs for ohio customers  which expired in varying months through september  also contributed to the margin increase 
these contracts are utilized to reduce the risk of price movements and changes in load requirements during customer signup periods 
earnings volatility results from the application of derivative accounting rules to the options requiring that these derivative instruments be marked to market  without a corresponding offset related to the customer contracts 
full requirements gas contracts with integrys energy services customers are not considered derivatives and  therefore  no gain or loss is recognized on these contracts until settlement 
spot to forward differential the natural gas storage cycle described in more detail below accounted for a million decrease in the wholesale natural gas margin for the year ended december   the natural gas storage cycle had a million negative impact on margin  compared with a million favorable impact on margin for the same period in 
integrys energy services experiences earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle  which runs annually from april through march of the next year 
generally  injections of natural gas into storage inventory take place in the summer months and natural gas is withdrawn from storage in the winter months 
integrys energy services policy is to hedge the value of natural gas storage with sales in the over the counter and futures markets  effectively locking in a margin on the natural gas in storage 
however  fair market value hedge accounting rules require the natural gas in storage to be marked to market using spot prices  while the future sales contracts are marked to market using forward prices 
when the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price of natural gas  integrys energy services experiences volatility in its earnings 
consequently  earnings volatility may occur within the contract period for natural gas in storage 
the accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions 
at december   there was a million difference between the market value of natural gas in storage and the market value of future sales contracts net unrealized loss  related to the natural gas storage cycle 
this difference between the market value of natural gas in storage and the market value of future sales contracts related to the storage cycle is expected to vary with market conditions  but will reverse entirely and have a positive impact on earnings when all of the natural gas is withdrawn from storage 
earnings integrys energy services earnings increased million  for the year ended december   compared to higher earnings were driven by the million increase in margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses  a million after tax increase in results from discontinued operations  a million decrease in section k federal tax credits  and the negative impact of a million after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle recorded in overview of holding company and other segment operations holding company and other operations include the operations of integrys energy group and the nonutility activities at wpsc and uppco 
holding company and other operations recognized earnings of million during the year ended december   compared to earnings of million in the decrease in earnings is primarily due to a million decrease in pre tax gains related to land sales  an income tax benefit recognized in from the donation of land to the wdnr  and a million increase in interest expense 
pre tax land sale gains of million were recognized in  compared to million of pre tax land sale gains in interest expense increased primarily as a result of restructuring sunbury s debt to a integrys energy group s obligation in june and higher average short term debt in  compared to partially offsetting the items discussed above was a million increase in pre tax equity earnings from atc and million of deferred financing costs that were written off in the first quarter of pre tax equity earnings from atc were million in  compared to million in integrys energy group s ownership interest in atc increased from approximately at december   to approximately at december  the higher ownership interest was primarily the result of integrys energy group s continued funding of a portion of the wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line 
operating expenses integrys energy group s operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense taxes other than income operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared to utility operating and maintenance expenses increased million  primarily as a result of a million increase in wpsc s operating and maintenance expenses 
the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in operating and maintenance expenses at wpsc the combined increase in pension expense  active and postretirement medical expense  salaries  and customer service expense was approximately million 
transmission related expenses increased million 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw concluded that only half of the loss related to the sale of kewaunee could be collected from ratepayers 
as a result  in wpsc wrote off million of the regulatory asset established for the loss on the sale of kewaunee 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw also disallowed recovery of increased operating and maintenance expenses related to the extended outage at kewaunee  resulting in a million write off in of previously deferred costs 
the increases discussed above were partially offset by a decrease in operating and maintenance expenses of approximately million related to kewaunee  due to the sale of this facility on july  operating and maintenance expenses at integrys energy services increased million 
approximately million of the increase related to higher payroll and benefit costs associated with recent business expansion 
commissions paid to brokers and third party agents increased million and bad debt expense increased million  primarily as a result of higher energy prices 
depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to  largely due to an increase of million at wpsc 
the increase at wpsc was driven by higher gains on decommissioning trust assets prior to the sale of kewaunee of approximately million 
realized gains on decommissioning trust assets included as a component of miscellaneous income offset the increased decommissioning expense pursuant to regulatory practice 
continued capital investment at wpsc also resulted in an increase in depreciation expense 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation resulting from the sale of the kewaunee assets in july other income expense integrys energy group s other income expense millions change miscellaneous income interest expense minority interest other expense income miscellaneous income miscellaneous income increased million for the year ended december   compared to the following items were the largest contributors to the change in miscellaneous income approximately million of the increase in miscellaneous income related to realized gains on nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets were placed in more conservative investments in the second quarter of in anticipation of the sale of kewaunee  which was completed on july  pursuant to regulatory practice  the increase in miscellaneous income related to the realized gains was offset by an increase in decommissioning expense 
overall  the change in the investment strategy for the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets had no impact on income available for common shareholders 
pre tax equity earnings from integrys energy group s investment in atc increased million 
pre tax equity earnings from atc were million in  compared to million in wpsc sold a interest in the weston power plant to dpc in the fourth quarter of proceeds received from the sale included reimbursement for approximately million of carrying costs incurred by wpsc for capital expenditures related to dpc s portion of the facility  which were funded by wpsc in and the million reimbursement was recorded as miscellaneous income in land sale gains of million were recognized in  compared to land sale gains of million in  resulting in a million decrease in miscellaneous income 
interest expense the increase in interest expense was primarily related to an increase in the average level of short term debt outstanding in  compared to provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate was driven by a tax benefit recorded in for land donated to the wdnr  a million increase in the year over year provision for income taxes related to favorable settlements of certain tax audits and refund claims in  and a million decrease in section k federal tax credits recognized 
our ownership interest in the synthetic fuel operation resulted in recognizing the tax benefit of section k federal tax credits totaling million in and million in discontinued operations  net of tax discontinued operations  net of tax  at sunbury increased million  from an after tax net loss of million in to after tax income of million in the margin at sunbury increased million  primarily due to improved opportunities to sell power into the market made possible by the expiration of a fixed price outtake contract on december   and higher energy market prices 
integrys energy services earnings were negatively impacted by an million pre tax impairment loss that was required to write down sunbury s long lived assets to fair market value and the recognition of million in interest expense related to the termination of sunbury s interest rate swap 
however  these items were substantially offset by an million pre tax gain recognized on the sale of sunbury s allocation emission allowances 
the year over year change in discontinued operations was also negatively impacted by a million termination payment received from duquesne power in december  as a result of duquesne s termination of the asset sale agreement with sunbury 
discontinued operations  net of tax  related to wps niagara generation  llc increased million  from a net loss of million in to income of million in the increase in income generated from wps niagara generation was mostly due to an increase in the average price per megawatt sold from this facility in compared to cumulative effect of change in accounting principles the adoption of interpretation no 
at integrys energy services on december   resulted in a negative million after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  related to recording a liability for asbestos remediation at certain of integrys energy services generation plants 
for the utility segments of integrys energy group  we concluded it was probable that any differences between expenses under interpretation no 
and expenses currently recovered through customer rates will be recoverable in future customer rates 
accordingly  the adoption of this statement had no impact on the utility segment s income 
balance sheet integrys energy group compared with inventories increased million  from million at december   to million at december  the increase in inventories was primarily related to an million increase in natural gas in storage at integrys energy services and a combined million increase related to natural gas in storage at mguc and merc 
a increase in natural gas volumes in storage at integrys energy services at december   compared to december   drove the increase in inventory at integrys energy services  which was partially offset by a decrease in the average cost of inventory in storage 
high natural gas storage spreads future natural gas sales prices were higher than the near term price of natural gas increased the profitability of natural gas transactions in  driving the increase in natural gas volumes in storage as well as the related structured wholesale natural gas storage transactions under contract at december   compared to december  current assets from risk management activities increased million at december   compared to december   and current liabilities from risk management activities increased million 
long term assets from risk management activities increased million at december   compared to december   and long term liabilities from risk management activities increased million 
the increase in short term and long term risk management assets and liabilities was primarily related to an increase in contracted forward natural gas and electric sales volumes  partially offset by a decrease in the forward price of natural gas and electricity at december   compared to december  contracted forward electric volumes increased significantly  largely due to the continued expansion of integrys energy services customer focused wholesale electric business  its entry into the texas and illinois retail electric markets  and moderate retail growth in new york and new england 
contracted forward natural gas volumes also increased  partially attributed to high natural gas storage spreads at the end of  which drove an increase in wholesale natural gas transactions under contract at december   compared to december  retail natural gas volumes under contract at december  also increased compared to the prior year as lower natural gas prices provided more opportunities for integrys energy services to enter into supply contracts with customers in existing markets 
property  plant  and equipment  net  increased million  to  million at december   from  million at december  the major contributors to the change in property  plant  and equipment are summarized below capital expenditures recorded in were million  of which million related to the construction of weston integrys energy group acquired retail natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota in  including million of property  plant  and equipment

credit ratings integrys energy group and wpsc use internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowing to satisfy most of their capital requirements 
integrys energy group also periodically issues long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt  maintain desired capitalization ratios  and fund future growth 
integrys energy group may seek nonrecourse financing for funding nonregulated acquisitions 
integrys energy group s commercial paper borrowing program provides for working capital requirements of the nonregulated businesses  uppco  mguc  and merc 
wpsc has its own commercial paper borrowing program 
wpsc also periodically issues long term debt  receives equity contributions from integrys energy group  and makes payments for return of capital to integrys energy group to reduce short term debt  fund future growth  and maintain capitalization ratios as authorized by the pscw 
the specific forms of long term financing  amounts  and timing depend on the availability of projects  market conditions  and other factors 
the current credit ratings for integrys energy group and wpsc are listed in the table below 
credit ratings standard poor s moody s integrys energy group corporate credit rating senior unsecured debt commercial paper credit facility junior subordinated notes a bbb a bbb n a a p a baa wpsc senior secured debt preferred stock commercial paper credit facility a bbb a aa a p a we believe these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry and allow us to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  are subject to change  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
on february   standard poor s lowered the corporate credit rating on integrys energy group to a from a and removed it from creditwatch with negative implications 
standard poor s also lowered integrys energy group s unsecured ratings to bbb from a and all other issue specific ratings by one notch 
standard poor s stated that the ratings actions are due to concerns related to plans to expand its energy marketing business  the dividend requirements that will result from the merger  moderate capital expenditure requirements  lower than expected performance at mguc and merc  and uncertainty regarding future rate relief as well as full integration to commence at the newly acquired peoples utilities 
standard poor s also lowered all wpsc s issue specific ratings by one notch as wpsc s liquidity is being pressured by its ongoing construction program 
standard poor s outlook for all integrys energy group related companies is negative pending the sale of peoples energy corporation s oil and natural gas production business and successful integration of recent acquisitions 
on february   moody s downgraded the senior unsecured rating of integrys energy group to a from a  downgraded the bank credit facility to a from a  downgraded the commercial paper rating to prime from prime  and downgraded the junior subordinated notes to baa from a moody s also downgraded wpsc s senior secured rating to aa from aa  its senior unsecured bank credit facility to a from aa  and its preferred stock to a from a moody s also confirmed wpsc s commercial paper rating at prime moody s actions to downgrade are due to concerns about increases in integrys energy group s consolidated debt levels and business risk profile evidenced by the increased scale and scope of the post merger non regulated energy marketing business plus the entry into the historically more challenging regulatory jurisdiction of illinois 
initially  on november   standard poor s assigned integrys energy group s million junior subordinated notes a bbb rating due to the note s subordinated position in integrys energy group s capital structure and the potential for interest deferral and moody s assigned a rating of a to the junior subordinated notes 
rating agencies use a number of both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a company s credit rating 
these measures include business risk  liquidity risk  competitive position  capital mix  financial condition  predictability of cash flows  management strength  and future direction 
some of the quantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios  while the qualitative measures are more subjective 
integrys energy group and wpsc hold credit lines to back of their commercial paper borrowing and letters of credit 
a significant decrease in the commercial paper credit ratings could adversely affect the companies by increasing the interest rates at which they can borrow and potentially limiting the availability of funds to the companies through the commercial paper market 
a restriction in the companies ability to use commercial paper borrowing to meet working capital needs would require them to secure funds through alternate sources resulting in higher interest expense  higher credit line fees  and a potential delay in the availability of funds 
integrys energy services maintains underlying agreements to support its electric and natural gas trading operations 
in the event of a deterioration of integrys energy group s credit rating  many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand additional assurance of payment 
this provision could pertain to existing business  new business  or both with the counterparty 
the additional assurance requirements could be met with letters of credit  surety bonds  or cash deposits and would likely result in integrys energy group being required to maintain increased bank lines of credit or incur additional expenses  and could restrict the amount of business integrys energy services would be able to conduct 
integrys energy services uses the nymex  the ice  and over the counter financial markets to mitigate its exposure to physical customer obligations 
these contracts are closely correlated to the customer contracts  but price movements on the contracts may require financial backing 
certain movements in price for contracts through the nymex and the ice require posting of cash deposits equal to the market move 
for the over the counter market  the underlying contract may allow the counterparty to require additional collateral to cover the net financial differential between the original contract price and the current forward market 
increased requirements related to market price changes usually only result in a temporary liquidity need that will unwind as the sales contracts are fulfilled 
discontinued operations net cash provided by discontinued operations was million in and million in the increase in cash provided by discontinued operations in was driven by a decrease in cash paid for emission allowances required to operate sunbury in  compared to substantially all of the emission allowances required to operate sunbury through the sale were purchased in  and from the million of proceeds received from the sale of sunbury in these increases were partially offset by million of proceeds received from the sale of sunbury s allocated emission allowances in which was partially offset by income taxes paid related to the gain on the sale of these emission allowances

regulatory matters and rate trends under the prevailing wisconsin fuel rules  wpsc s electric rates were subject to adjustment when electric generation fuel and purchased power costs fell outside of a pre determined band 
this band was set at and  for by the pscw 
on march   the pscw filed a notice of proceeding to review fuel rates as wpsc fuel costs were below the limit 
on april   wpsc filed with the pscw a stipulation agreement with various interveners to refund a portion of the difference between fuel costs that were projected in the wisconsin retail rate case and actual wisconsin retail fuel costs incurred during the first half of this refund resulted in a credit to customers bills over the months of may to august on october   wpsc filed for an additional refund of million to reflect additional fuel cost savings in the third quarter of the pscw approved this filing and ordered this amount to be refunded based on november and december usage 
customer refunds of million were made in  related to the stipulation agreement 
an additional refund to customers of million was accrued at december  wpsc expects to make a final refund to customers in the spring of in its rate order  wpsc s band was set at and  for by the pscw

in wpsc s rate case proceeding for  after applying the financial harm test  the pscw disallowed rate recovery of the extended outage at kewaunee 
the pscw also disallowed recovery of of the pre tax loss realized on the sale of kewaunee 
none of these disallowed costs were found to be imprudent by the pscw 
notwithstanding the pscw s decision on these kewaunee related deferred costs  wpsc still believes it is probable that all regulatory assets recorded at december   will be collected from ratepayers 
in both and  forecasting and monitoring of fuel costs have become extremely difficult for both the pscw and wpsc 
these challenges can be attributed to the implementation of the miso day market and volatility in natural gas prices 
in  the pscw received several applications from various wisconsin electric utilities under the psc chapter fuel rules for large rate increases due to increased natural gas prices 
in response  on february   the pscw opened docket ac to review the fuel rules 
on february   the five utilities subject to the current fuel rules filed proposed changes to the fuel rules with the pscw 
the primary proposed change was to replace the trigger mechanism with a true dead band of which would limit a utility s annual exposure or opportunity to a maximum of of fuel costs 
on june   the pscw opened docket ei to address the recovery of costs associated with the miso day market 
testimony has been filed and hearings were held february  as of december   wpsc had recorded a regulatory asset of million for unrecovered miso day costs 
the recoverability and the timing of recovery of this regulatory asset and other costs will be addressed in this docket 
management still believes it is probable that the regulatory asset recorded for unrecovered miso day costs will be collected from rate payers

however  prolonged high wholesale energy prices coupled with approved tariff changes for the regulated utilities have almost eliminated the savings customers can obtain from contracting with non utility suppliers 
as a result  many customers returned to the bundled tariff service of the incumbent utilities 
the high wholesale energy prices and tariff changes caused a reduction in new business and renewals for integrys energy services 
in  integrys energy services michigan retail electric business declined to less than one fourth the peak megawatts it was in  and earnings contributed by integrys energy services michigan retail electric operations in were minimal 
however  both detroit edison and consumers energy have initiated proceedings before the mpsc for rate increases relating to the recovery of substantial power supply costs incurred but not included in rates in market prices for power in also declined significantly over the past six months  further reducing the benefit that regulated utility customers have experienced 
the combination of lower market prices and potentially increasing utility rates could create the necessary conditions for customers to once again contract with non utility suppliers 
the status of michigan s electric markets and more specifically the mpsc s capacity needs report of january   were the subject of hearings in both the senate and house energy committees 
in addition  on april   governor granholm issued an executive directive instructing mpsc chair peter lark to complete a state energy plan 
on january   chairman peter lark submitted the state s st century energy plan to governor granholm 
see michigan st century energy plan discussion below for more information 
if legislation rolling back the electric choice market is enacted  it could diminish the benefits of competitive supply for michigan business customers 
the impact on integrys energy services of all the above  coupled with the volatile wholesale power market could range from significantly increasing michigan business to a possible decision by integrys energy services to exit michigan s retail electric market and redirect resources to more vibrant markets 
however  it is unlikely that the most significant stakeholder  the customer  will stand for any set of outcomes that eradicates electric choice 
integrys energy services is actively participating in the legislative and regulatory process in order to protect its interests in michigan

income taxes synthetic fuel production facility assuming no phase out  integrys energy services expects to recognize approximately million of section k federal tax credits in  both from its ownership interest in a synthetic fuel facility and additional tons of synthetic fuel integrys energy services will procure from one of its synthetic fuel partners 
however  for  we cannot predict the future prices of a barrel of oil and  therefore  have no way of knowing what portion of our tax credits will ultimately be phased out 
integrys energy services estimates that section k federal tax credits will begin phasing out if the annual average nymex price of a barrel of oil reaches approximately  with a total phase out if the annual average nymex price of a barrel of oil reaches approximately at december   integrys energy services had derivative option contracts that mitigated approximately of its volumetric exposure to section k phase outs in the derivative contracts involve purchased and written options that provide for net cash settlement at expiration based on the annual average nymex trading price of oil in relation to the strike price of each option 
the derivative contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments and  as a result  changes in the fair value of the options are recorded currently as a component of nonregulated revenue 
this results in mark to market gains or losses being recognized in earnings in different periods than the tax credits 
pre tax mark to market gains losses recognized in and related to options were million and million  respectively 
this million net gain will reverse in assuming no phase out 
in addition  based upon the option contracts in place at december   integrys energy services anticipates it would recognize approximately million of realized pre tax losses in assuming no phase out  which is equivalent to the cost of mitigating the risk of phase out of of the section k tax credits

midwest independent transmission system operator wpsc  uppco  and integrys energy services are members of the miso  which operates an electric wholesale market in the midwest  including wisconsin and the upper peninsula of michigan 
the market pricing is based on a locational marginal pricing system 
the pricing mechanism expanded the market from a physical market to also include financial instruments and is intended to send price signals to stakeholders where generation or transmission system expansion is needed 
miso participants offer their generation and bid their customer load into the market on an hourly basis 
this results in net receipts from  or net obligations to  miso for each hour of each day 
miso aggregates these hourly transactions and currently provides updated settlement statements which may reflect billing adjustments and result in an increase or decrease to the net receipt from or net obligation to miso 
the billing adjustments may or may not be recovered through the rate recovery process 
market participants may dispute the updated settlement statements and related charges 
at the end of each month  the amount due from or payable to miso is estimated for those operating days where a day settlement statement is not yet available 
thus  significant changes in the estimates and new information provided by miso in subsequent settlement statements or through tariff interpretation changes could have a material impact on our results of operations with adjustments back to the start of the market

market price risk management activities integrys energy group market price risk management activities include the electric and natural gas marketing and related risk management activities of integrys energy services  along with oil options used to mitigate the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce the amount of section k federal tax credits that could be recognized 
integrys energy services marketing and trading operations manage power and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments 
derivative instruments are utilized in these operations 
integrys energy services measures the fair value of derivative instruments including nymex  ice  and over the counter contracts  options  natural gas and electric power physical fixed price contracts  basis contracts  and related financial instruments on a mark to market basis 
the fair value of derivatives is included in assets or liabilities from risk management activities on integrys energy group s consolidated balance sheets 
the offsetting entry when fair value adjustments are made to assets or liabilities from risk management activities is to other comprehensive income for the effective portion of cash flow hedges or to earnings 
the fair values of derivative instruments are adjusted each reporting period using various market sources and risk management systems 
the primary input for natural gas and oil pricing is the settled forward price curve of the nymex and the ice 
basis pricing is derived from published indices and documented broker quotes 
integrys energy services also determines electric prices based on published indices and documented broker quotes 
the following table provides an assessment of the factors impacting the change in the net value of integrys energy services assets and liabilities from risk management activities for the year ended december  integrys energy services mark to market roll forward millions oil options natural gas electric total fair value of contracts at january  less contracts realized or settled during period plus changes in fair value of contracts in existence at december  fair value of contracts at december  the fair value of contracts at january   and december   reflects the values reported on the balance sheet for net mark to market current and long term risk management assets and liabilities as of those dates 
contracts realized or settled during the period includes the value of contracts in existence at january   that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of december   along with the amortization of those derivatives later designated as normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
changes in fair value of contracts in existence at december   includes unrealized gains and losses on contracts that existed at january   and contracts that were entered into subsequent to january   which are included in integrys energy services portfolio at december   as well as gains and losses at the inception of contracts when a liquid market exists 
there were  in many cases  offsetting positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period 
the realized gains or losses from these offsetting positions are not reflected in the table above 
market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts generally for contracts with a duration of less than five years 
the table below shows the sources of fair value and maturity of integrys energy services risk management instruments 
integrys energy services risk management contract aging at fair value as of december  millions source of fair value maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity in excess of years total fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by external sources total fair value we derive the pricing for most contracts in the above table from active quotes or external sources 
prices actively quoted includes exchange traded contracts such as nymex and ice contracts and a majority of basis swaps 
prices provided by external sources includes electric and natural gas contract positions for which pricing information  used by integrys energy services to calculate fair value  is obtained primarily through broker quotes and other publicly available sources 
integrys energy services employs a variety of physical and financial instruments offered in the marketplace to limit risk exposure associated with fluctuating commodity prices and volumes  enhance value  and minimize cash flow volatility 
however  the application of sfas no 
and its related hedge accounting rules causes integrys energy services to experience earnings volatility associated with electric and natural gas operations 
integrys energy services use of oil options to protect the value of a portion of integrys energy services section k federal tax credits also causes earnings volatility 
while risks associated with power generating facilities and power and natural gas contracts are economically hedged  certain transactions do not meet the definition of a derivative or do not qualify for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles 
consequently  gains and losses from these positions may not match with the income or loss on the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods 
the result causes volatility in integrys energy services reported period by period earnings  however  the income statement impact of such gains or losses will reverse at the time of physical delivery and or settlement 
the accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions 
see results of operations integrys energy group for information regarding earnings volatility caused by the natural gas storage cycle 
critical accounting policies integrys energy group we have identified the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
integrys energy group s management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
risk management activities integrys energy group has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
at december   those derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities  as well as oil options used to manage exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce the amount of section k federal tax credits we could recognize from integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel production facility 
cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when integrys energy group s contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery to protect future cash flows corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases 
fair value hedge accounting may be used when integrys energy group holds assets or firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk that the price of a commodity may change between the contract s inception and the physical delivery date of the commodity 
to the extent that the hedging instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge 
derivatives at the utility segments do not impact income available for common shareholders because regulatory assets or liabilities are recorded pursuant to sfas no 
in addition  integrys energy group may apply the normal purchases and sales exception  provided by sfas no 
 as amended  to certain contracts 
the normal purchases and sales exception provides that recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts 
derivative contracts that are determined to fall within the scope of sfas no 
 as amended  are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets of integrys energy group 
changes in fair value  except those related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges or qualifying for regulatory deferral  are generally included in the determination of income available for common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled 
when available  quoted market prices are used to determine a contract s fair value 
if no active trading market exists for a commodity or for a contract s duration  fair value is estimated through the use of internally developed valuation techniques or models using external information wherever possible 
such estimates require significant judgment as to assumptions and valuation methodologies deemed appropriate by integrys energy group s management 
like most commodity markets  after some length of time  markets for gas and power become relatively illiquid  making it difficult to obtain reliable price information 
as a component of the fair value determination  integrys energy group considers the requirements to service certain of its contracts as well as counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk 
this component of the fair value determination is especially subjective because limited liquid market information is available to estimate this component 
the effect of changing the underlying assumptions for this component of fair value is as follows change in component effect on fair value of risk management assets and liabilities at december  millions increase decrease decrease increase these potential changes in fair value would be included in current and long term liabilities from risk management activities on the consolidated balance sheets and as part of nonregulated revenue on the consolidated statements of income unless the related contracts are designated as cash flow hedges  in which case potential changes would be included in other comprehensive income cash flow hedges on the consolidated statements of common shareholders equity 
purchase accounting our acquisitions of mguc and merc were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as prescribed in sfas no 
 business combinations 
management makes assumptions of fair value based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
assumptions may be incomplete  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the validity of such assumptions  estimates  or actual results 
both mguc and merc are predominantly regulated utilities  therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  the fair value of the majority of the assets and liabilities did not change significantly as a result of applying purchase accounting 
material environmental related pre acquisition contingencies were identified at mguc related to required natural gas plant remediation  however  mguc received authorization from the mpsc to recover any prudently incurred costs related to this environmental liability in future rates 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 the environmental liability of approximately million recorded for natural gas plant remediation was offset by a corresponding regulatory asset 
in addition  pension and postretirement benefit obligations were identified at both mguc and merc 
liabilities of approximately million and million were recorded for mguc and merc  respectively and were offset with regulatory assets 
as discussed below within asset impairment  a significant amount of goodwill resulted from these acquisitions  which will require impairment testing on at least an annual basis 
asset impairment integrys energy group annually reviews its assets for impairment 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  form the basis for these analyses 
the review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to integrys energy services than to our other segments because of its significant investment in property  plant  and equipment and lack of access to cost of service based rate setting that is available to our regulated segments 
at december   the carrying value of integrys energy services property  plant  and equipment totaled million 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of power plants is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future market sales pricing  production costs  capital expenditures  and generation volumes and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
management s assumptions about future market sales prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual market sales prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs  environmental changes  and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the primary estimates used at integrys energy services in the impairment analysis are future revenue streams and operating costs 
a combination of inputs from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams 
integrys energy services forecasts future operating costs with input from external sources for fuel costs and forward energy prices 
these estimates are modeled over the projected remaining life of the power plants using the methodology defined in sfas no 
integrys energy services evaluates property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
these indicators include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the use of the assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
sfas no 
requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
for assets held for sale  impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value of such assets exceeds the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value or fair value less costs to sell if held for sale 
throughout  integrys energy services tested its power plants for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount might not be recoverable 
no impairment charges were recorded in as a result of the recoverability tests 
results of past impairment tests may not necessarily be an indicator of future tests given the criticality of the accounting estimates involved  as discussed more fully above 
changes in actual results or assumptions could result in an impairment 
wpsc recorded goodwill of million in its gas utility segment resulting from the wisconsin fuel and light acquisition in in  integrys energy group recorded million of goodwill in conjunction with the acquisition of the natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota 
the goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually based on the guidance of sfas no 
the test for impairment includes assumptions about future profitability of our gas utility reporting units and the correlation between our natural gas utility operations and published projections for other similar natural gas utility operations 
a significant change in the natural gas utility market and or our projections of future profitability could result in a loss being recorded on the income statement as a result of the impairment test 
receivables and reserves our regulated natural gas and electric utilities and integrys energy services accrue estimated amounts of revenue for services rendered but not yet billed 
estimated unbilled sales are calculated using actual generation and throughput volumes  recorded sales  and weather factors 
the estimated unbilled sales are assigned different rates based on historical customer class allocations 
at december  and  integrys energy group s unbilled revenues were million and million  respectively 
any difference between actual sales and the estimates are recorded in revenue in the next period 
integrys energy services  uppco  merc and mguc record reserves for potential uncollectible customer accounts as an expense on the income statement and an uncollectible reserve on the balance sheet 
wpsc  however  records a regulatory asset to offset its uncollectible reserve 
because the nonregulated energy marketing business involves higher credit risk  the reserve is more critical to integrys energy services than to our other segments 
integrys energy services calculates the reserve for potential uncollectible customer receivable balances by applying an estimated bad debt experience rate to each past due aging category and reserving for of specific customer receivable balances deemed to be uncollectible 
the basis for calculating the reserve for receivables from wholesale counterparties considers netting agreements  collateral  and guarantees 
if the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect  or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults  there could be significant changes to the expense and uncollectible reserve balance 
pension and postretirement benefits the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits  described in note  employee benefit plans  in integrys energy group s notes to consolidated financial statements  are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience 
pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plan  and earnings on plan assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  discount rates used in determining the projected benefit and other postretirement benefit obligations and pension and other postretirement benefit costs  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
integrys energy group s pension plan assets and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at our regulated segments through the ratemaking process 
the following chart shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported annual pension cost on the income statement as they relate to all of our defined benefit pension plans 
each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only 
actuarial assumption millions  except percentages percent change in assumption impact on projected benefit obligation impact on pension cost discount rate discount rate rate of return on plan assets n a rate of return on plan assets n a the following chart shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and the reported annual other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement

actuarial assumption millions  except percentages percent change in assumption impact on postretirement benefit obligation impact on postretirement benefit cost discount rate discount rate health care cost trend rate health care cost trend rate rate of return on plan assets n a rate of return on plan assets n a in selecting an assumed discount rate  we use the mercer pension discount yield curve  which considers bonds  rated by moody s as aa or better  selected from the lehman brothers database that are non callable 
regression analysis is applied to construct a best fit curve that makes coupon yields to maturity a function of time to maturity 
the pension or retiree medical cash flows are then matched to the appropriate spot rates and discounted back to the measurement date 
to select an assumed long term rate of return on qualified plan assets  we consider the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target allocation of the benefit trust portfolios 
the assumed long term rate of return was in  in  and in for   and  the actual rates of return on pension plan assets  net of fees  were   and  respectively 
we base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
cumulative gains and losses in excess of of the greater of the pension benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on plan assets are recognized for purposes of calculating benefit cost over a five year period 
because of this method  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  we consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
more information on health care cost trend rates can be found in note  employee benefit plans  in integrys energy group s notes to consolidated financial statements 
for a table showing future payments that integrys energy group expects to make for pension and other postretirement benefits  see note  employee benefit plans  in integrys energy group s notes to consolidated financial statements 
regulatory accounting the electric and gas utility segments of integrys energy group follow sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
we defer certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as expenses and revenues because our regulators have authorized deferral as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  but is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes  earnings at the utility segments  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  we amortize the regulatory assets and liabilities into income over the rate recovery period 
if recovery of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period income 
if our regulated electric and gas utility segments no longer meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
 we would discontinue its application as defined under sfas no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of sfas no 
assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred 
a write off of all of integrys energy group s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december   would result in a decrease in total assets  a decrease in total liabilities  and a decrease in income from continuing operations before taxes 
a write off of all of wpsc s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december   would result in a decrease in wpsc s total assets  a decrease in wpsc s total liabilities  and an decrease in wpsc s income before taxes 
tax provision as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance  which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in the income statement 
the interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty  since tax authorities may interpret them differently 
we establish liabilities for tax related contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and review them in light of changing facts and circumstances 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  our sfas tax contingency reserve and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the assumptions involved are supported by historical data and reasonable projections 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on integrys energy group s financial condition and results of operations 
impact of inflation integrys energy group our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
for our regulated operations  to the extent we are not recovering the effects of inflation  we will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions 
our nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs 
however  any increase from inflation is offset with projected business growth 
therefore  the estimated effect of inflation on our nonregulated businesses is minor 
results of operations wpsc wpsc is a regulated electric and natural gas utility as well as a holding company 
electric and natural gas operations contributed approximately and of revenues in  respectively 
compared with wpsc overview wpsc s earnings on common stock for the years ended december are shown in the following table wpsc s results millions change earnings on common stock wpsc s earnings on common stock were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as discussed in more detail below  the following factors impacted earnings for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric utility earnings increased million for the year ended december   compared to fuel and purchased power costs that were less than were recovered in rates during the year ended december   compared to fuel and purchased power costs that were more than were recovered in rates during the same period in the under collection in was primarily due to the impact the hurricanes had on natural gas prices  contributed an estimated million after tax year over year increase in earnings 
in addition  a pscw ruling  which disallowed recovery of costs that were deferred related to the kewaunee nuclear plant outage as well as a portion of the loss on the kewaunee sale  resulted in the write off of million of regulatory assets in  resulting in an after tax year over year increase in earnings of approximately million 
the electric rate increases at wpsc also had a positive year over year impact on earnings 
these increases were partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions in  compared to  which had an estimated million year over year negative after tax impact on electric utility earnings 
natural gas utility earnings decreased million  from earnings of million in  to earnings of million in  driven by unfavorable weather conditions and customer conservation efforts 
electric utility operations electric utility results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power margin sales in kilowatt hours residential commercial and industrial wholesale other total sales in kilowatt hours weather heating degree days actual cooling degree days actual electric utility revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  largely due to the approved electric rate increases for wpsc s retail electric customers see note  regulatory environment  in integrys energy group s notes to consolidated financial statements for more information related to these rate increases and rate increases for wpsc s wholesale customers resulting from the formula rate mechanism in place for these customers 
electric sales volumes also increased  primarily related to a increase in sales volumes to wholesale customers due to higher demand and new wholesale contracts 
unfavorable weather conditions during both the heating and cooling seasons for the year ended december   compared to  partially offset the increases discussed above 
the electric utility margin decreased million for the year ended december   compared to  primarily related to the sale of kewaunee on july   and the related power purchase agreement 
excluding the million increase in fixed payments made to dominion energy kewaunee during the year ended december   wpsc s electric utility margin increased million  driven by the retail electric and wholesale rate increases discussed above 
in addition  fuel and purchased power costs were less than were recovered in rates during the year ended december   compared to fuel and purchased power costs that were more than were recovered in rates during the same period in the under collection in was primarily due to the impact the hurricanes had on natural gas prices  which had an estimated million positive year over year impact on margin 
the margin was also positively impacted by higher wholesale electric sales volumes  driven by higher demand from existing customers and new wholesale customer contracts 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in margin related to the refund to retail customers and the accrual for the refund to wholesale customers of a portion of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to retail and wholesale customers 
pursuant to regulatory accounting  the decrease in margin related to this refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in operating and maintenance expense as explained below and  therefore  did not have an impact on earnings 
unfavorable weather conditions during both the heating and cooling seasons also negatively impacted margin by an estimated million 
gas utility operations gas utility results millions change revenues purchase costs margins throughput in therms residential commercial and industrial interruptible interdepartmental transport total sales in therms weather cooling degree days actual heating degree days actual natural gas utility revenue decreased million  from million for the year ended december   compared to million in lower natural gas revenues were driven by a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes  primarily related to a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes to the electric utility for electric generation and a combined decrease in throughput volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers 
the decrease in throughput volumes to the electric utility resulted from a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its natural gas fired peaking generation units during the year ended december   compared to  and from higher dispatch of these peaking generation units by miso in for reliability purposes 
the decrease in throughput volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers was also driven by unfavorable weather conditions in compared to  as well as customer conservation efforts 
particularly at the beginning of  customers were taking measures to conserve energy as a result of the high natural gas prices 
for the year ended december   natural gas prices were actually lower on a per unit basis  compared to  resulting from a large decline in the price of natural gas in the second half of  also contributing to the decrease in natural gas revenue 
partially offsetting the decrease in natural gas utility revenue was wpsc s natural gas rate increase see note  regulatory environment  in integrys energy group s notes to consolidated financial statements for more information related to this rate increase 
the natural gas utility margin decreased million  from million in  to million in as discussed in more detail above  a decrease in throughput volumes to higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers was partially offset by the natural gas rate increase 
the decrease in natural gas volumes sold to the electric utility did not have a significant impact on the natural gas utility margin as sales to the electric utility have very low margins 
operating expenses year ended december  operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense federal income taxes state income taxes other income year ended december  other income and deductions millions change allowance for equity funds used during construction other  net income taxes operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expenses decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in operating and maintenance expenses at wpsc partial amortization of the regulatory liability recorded for wpsc s obligation to refund proceeds received from the liquidation of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to retail and wholesale electric ratepayers contributed million to the decrease in operating expenses in  compared to pursuant to regulatory accounting  the decrease in operating expense related to this refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in margin as discussed in electric utility operations  above 
operating and maintenance related to the kewaunee nuclear plant decreased approximately million  driven by the sale of this facility in july the decrease in operating and maintenance expense related to kewaunee did not have a significant impact on income available for common shareholders as wpsc is still purchasing power from this facility in the same amount as its original ownership interest 
the cost of the power is included as a component of utility cost of fuel  natural gas  and purchased power 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw concluded that only half of the loss related to the sale of kewaunee could be collected from ratepayers 
as a result  in wpsc wrote off million of the regulatory asset established for the loss on the sale of kewaunee  creating a corresponding year over year decrease in operating expenses 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw also disallowed recovery of increased operating and maintenance expenses related to the extended outage at kewaunee  resulting in a million write off in of previously deferred costs  creating a corresponding year over year decrease in operating expenses 
salaries and employee benefits also decreased  in part due to the sale of kewaunee in software amortization increased million  driven by the late implementation of a new customer billing system 
excluding kewaunee  maintenance expenses at the electric utility segment were up million 
planned maintenance was required on certain combustion turbines  and maintenance expense related to electric distribution assets also increased 
electric transmission expense increased million 
depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense decreased million for the year ended december   compared to  driven by approximately million of decommissioning expense that was recorded during  compared to no decommissioning expense recorded in  and a million decrease in depreciation expense resulting from the sale of kewaunee in july subsequent to the sale of kewaunee  decommissioning expense is no longer recorded 
in  realized gains on decommissioning trust assets were substantially offset by decommissioning expense pursuant to regulatory practice see analysis of federal income taxes state income taxes other income below 
continued capital investment at wpsc also partially offset the overall decrease in depreciation and decommissioning expense 
federal income taxes state income taxes other income the period over period change in these categories was primarily related to the realized gains recognized on the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets in approximately million of the decrease in other income related to the realized gains recorded on the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets during the year ended december   compared to no gain or loss recorded on nonqualified decommissioning trust assets in  due to the liquidation of the nonqualified decommissioning trust in the third quarter of the nonqualified nuclear decommissioning trust assets were placed in more conservative investments in the second quarter of in anticipation of the sale of kewaunee  which closed on july  pursuant to regulatory practice  the increase in miscellaneous income related to the realized gains recorded in was offset by an increase in decommissioning expense during the same period discussed above 
income tax expense related to the realized gains was offset by a deferred tax benefit related to the decommissioning expense 
overall  the change in the investment strategy for the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets had no impact on earnings in  as summarized in the table below 
millions income expense depreciation and decommissioning expense federal income taxes state income taxes other  net income taxes total earnings impact the remaining increase in federal and state income taxes was driven by an increase in wpsc s earnings in  compared to the remaining decrease in other income was primarily related to fewer land sales occurring in  compared to for the year ended december   wpsc recognized pre tax land sale gains of million  compared to million in compared with wpsc overview wpsc s earnings on common stock for the years ended december are shown in the following table wpsc s results millions change earnings on common stock wpsc s earnings on common stock were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as discussed in more detail below  the following factors negatively impacted earnings for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric utility earnings decreased million for the year ended december   compared to electric utility earnings were negatively impacted by fuel and purchased power costs that were million in excess of what wpsc was allowed to recover from its customers due to inefficiencies in the fuel recovery process million related to retail customers and million related to wholesale customers 
in addition  the pscw s ruling in the rate case  which disallowed recovery of costs that were deferred related to the kewaunee outage and a portion of the loss on the kewaunee sale  resulted in the write off of million of regulatory assets 
natural gas utility earnings decreased million  driven by higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher depreciation expense 
pre tax gains on land sales at wpsc decreased million in  compared to wpsc recognized pre tax land sale gains of million in  compared to pre tax land sale gains of million in wpsc recognized an income tax benefit in from the donation of land to the wdnr 
electric utility operations electric utility results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric utility revenue increased largely due to an approved electric rate increase for wpsc s wisconsin retail customers and an increase in electric sales volumes 
on december   the pscw approved a retail electric rate increase of million  effective january  the rate increase was required primarily to recover increased costs related to fuel and purchased power  the construction of the weston power plant  and benefit costs 
electric sales volumes increased  primarily due to significantly warmer weather during the cooling season  compared to the same period in  and new power sales agreements that were entered into with wholesale customers 
as a result of the warm weather  wpsc set all time records for peak electric demand in the second and third quarters of the electric utility margin decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   largely driven by the sale of kewaunee on july   and the related power purchase agreement 
prior to the sale of kewaunee  only nuclear fuel expense was reported as a component of fuel and purchased power costs 
subsequent to the sale  all payments to dominion for power purchased from kewaunee are reported as a component of fuel and purchased power costs 
these include both variable payments for energy delivered and fixed payments 
as a result of the sale  wpsc no longer incurs operating and maintenance expense  depreciation and decommissioning expense  or interest expense for kewaunee 
excluding the million of fixed payments made to dominion in  wpsc s electric utility margin increased million compared to this increase in margin was primarily related to the approved retail electric rate increase discussed above and the warm summer weather conditions  partially offset by higher fuel and purchased power costs associated with high natural gas prices and the pscw s disallowance of certain costs in its decision on the rate case for for wpsc these costs were previously approved for deferral 
fuel and purchased power costs incurred in exceeded the amount recovered from ratepayers by million of which million related to wisconsin retail customers and million related to wholesale customers  negatively impacting margin 
the increase in fuel and purchased power costs resulted primarily from the destruction of certain natural gas production facilities in the gulf of mexico by hurricanes in the third quarter of  driving up the per unit cost of natural gas used in generation 
the quantity of power generated from wpsc s natural gas fired units was also up over the prior year  driven by the warm summer weather conditions experienced during  increased dispatch by the miso for reliability purposes  and purchases through a power purchase agreement from the fox energy center which began operating in june 
certain costs related to the miso were approved for deferral 
authorization was requested from the pscw to defer increased natural gas costs related to the hurricanes  but this request was denied  leaving the wisconsin fuel recovery mechanism as the only option for recovery 
however  because of the way the wisconsin fuel recovery mechanism works  the million increase in costs primarily related to the combination of rising natural gas prices caused by the hurricanes and the increase in natural gas fired generation were essentially unrecoverable since they were incurred late in the year 
to mitigate the risk of unrecoverable fuel costs in due to market price volatility  wpsc employed risk management techniques pursuant to its risk policy approved by the pscw  including the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options 
the pscw also disallowed recovery of million of increased fuel and purchased power costs related to an extended outage at kewaunee in  resulting in this deferral being written off in the fourth quarter of electric utility earnings decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the decrease in earnings resulted from the high fuel and purchased power costs that wpsc was unable to recover from its wisconsin retail and wholesale customers  the pscw s disallowance of previously deferred costs related to kewaunee  and an increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
gas utility operations gas utility results millions change revenues purchase costs margins throughput in therms gas utility revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to gas utility revenue increased primarily as a result of an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas  a natural gas rate increase  and higher natural gas throughput volumes 
natural gas costs increased on a per unit basis for the year ended december   compared to following regulatory practice  wpsc passes changes in the total cost of natural gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause  as allowed by the pscw and the mpsc 
the pscw issued an order authorizing a natural gas rate increase of million  effective january  the rate increase was primarily driven by higher benefit costs and the cost of natural gas distribution system improvements 
natural gas throughput volumes increased  driven by an increase in interdepartmental sales from the natural gas utility to the electric utility as a result of increased generation from combustion turbines 
higher natural gas throughput volumes from interdepartmental sales to the electric utility were partially offset by lower natural gas throughput volumes to residential customers  driven by milder weather conditions in compared to wpsc also believes customers were taking measures to conserve energy as a result of the high natural gas prices 
the natural gas utility margin increased million for the year ended december   compared to the higher natural gas utility margin was largely due to the rate increase mentioned above 
the increase in interdepartmental sales volumes to wpsc s electric utility also had a positive impact on the natural gas margin 
gas utility earnings for the year ended december   decreased million  primarily due to an increase in operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation expense incurred by the gas utility 
operating expenses operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared to the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in operating and maintenance expenses at wpsc the combined increase in pension expense  active and postretirement medical expense  salaries  and customer service expense was approximately million 
transmission related expenses increased million 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw concluded that only half of the loss related to the sale of kewaunee could be collected from ratepayers 
as a result  in wpsc wrote off million of the regulatory asset established for the loss on the sale of kewaunee 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw also disallowed recovery of increased operating and maintenance expenses related to the extended outage at kewaunee  resulting in a million write off in of previously deferred costs 
the increases discussed above were partially offset by a decrease in operating and maintenance expenses of approximately million related to kewaunee  due to the sale of this facility on july  depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to  driven by higher gains on decommissioning trust assets prior to the sale of kewaunee of approximately million 
realized gains on decommissioning trust assets included as a component of miscellaneous income offset the increased decommissioning expense pursuant to regulatory practice 
continued capital investment at wpsc also resulted in an increase in depreciation expense 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation resulting from the sale of the kewaunee assets in july federal income taxes state income taxes other income the period over period change in these account balances was primarily related to the increase in realized gains recognized on the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets in approximately million of the increase in other income related to the realized gains on the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets 
the nonqualified nuclear decommissioning trust assets were placed in more conservative investments in the second quarter of in anticipation of the sale of kewaunee  which closed on july  pursuant to regulatory practice  the increase in miscellaneous income related to the realized gains was offset by an increase in decommissioning expense 
income tax expense related to the realized gains was offset by a deferred tax benefit related to the decommissioning expense 
overall  the change in the investment strategy for the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets had no impact on earnings  as summarized in the table below 
millions income expense depreciation and decommissioning expense federal income taxes state income taxes other  net income taxes total earnings impact other income at wpsc increased million in compared to excluding the increase in other income related to higher realized gains on the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets in and the decrease in other income related to higher income taxes related to these realized gains  miscellaneous income decreased approximately million 
the remaining decrease was primarily driven by a million decrease in pre tax gains on land sales 
wpsc recognized pre tax land sale gains of million in  compared to pre tax land sale gains of million in this decrease was partially offset by dpc s reimbursement of million of carrying costs incurred by wpsc related to the weston power plant 
the reimbursement was recorded within miscellaneous income 
wpsc sold a interest in the weston power plant to dpc in the fourth quarter of proceeds received from the sale included a reimbursement for approximately million of carrying costs incurred by wpsc for capital expenditures related to dpcs portion of the facility  which were funded by wpsc in and balance sheet wpsc compared with net utility plant increased million  from  million at december   to  million at december  the major contributors to the change in net utility plant are summarized below capital expenditures recorded in were million  of which million related to the construction of weston depreciation expense of million was recorded in regulatory assets increased million  from million at december   to million at december   driven by an increase in the regulatory asset for pension and postretirement benefit items related to wpsc s adoption of sfas no

liquidity and capital resources wpsc wpsc believes that its cash  operating cash flows  and borrowing ability because of strong credit ratings  when taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  wpsc s operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside its control 
in addition  wpsc s borrowing costs can be impacted by its short term and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  which in part are based on certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
currently  wpsc believes these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry see liquidity and capital resources integrys energy group for more information

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks and other significant risks integrys energy group has potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk including regulatory recovery risk  interest rate risk  equity return risk  and principal preservation risk 
integrys energy group is also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries business and the environment in which we operate 
integrys energy group has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures  as further described below 
commodity price risk and regulatory recovery risk utilities the electric utilities of integrys energy group purchase natural gas and coal for use in power generation 
they also purchase power on the miso market at a price that is often reflective of the underlying cost of natural gas used in power generation 
as a result  the electric utilities are subject to commodity price risk  which they manage in a number of ways  the primary method being fuel recovery mechanisms 
prudent fuel and purchased power costs are recovered under one for one recovery mechanisms by uppco and by the michigan electric operations and wholesale operations of wpsc 
the costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utility subsidiaries are generally also recovered under one for one recovery mechanisms 
these recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities 
wpsc s wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations  but annual rate cases have mitigated the year to year price risk 
for intra year price risk  a fuel window mechanism is used to recover costs resulting from significant price volatility 
under the fuel window  if actual fuel and purchased power costs deviate by more than the range for and  a rate review can be triggered 
once a rate review is triggered  rates may be reset subject to pscw approval for the remainder of the year to recover  on an annualized basis  the projected increase in the cost of fuel and purchased power 
for  under the order approving the merger of integrys energy group with peoples energy  wpsc will be allowed to adjust wisconsin retail electric rates effective january   to take into account the impact of natural gas prices on purchased power costs  as well as changes in the price of coal  rail costs to ship the coal  and natural gas used for fuel 
however  for  wpsc will not be allowed to adjust retail electric rates for other changes 
to manage commodity price risk  our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
in addition  the electric operation of wpsc and the natural gas operation of merc are employing risk management techniques pursuant to the risk policies approved by their respective regulators  which include the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options 
nonregulated subsidiary for purposes of risk management disclosure  integrys energy services activities are classified as non trading 
integrys energy services has the ability to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from its merchant generation plants through the use of various financial and physical tools including forward contracts and options 
integrys energy services also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage market risks related to its retail supply portfolio 
to measure commodity price risk exposure  integrys energy group employs a number of controls and processes  including a value at risk var analysis of its exposures 
integrys energy services var calculation is utilized to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its marketing and trading portfolio primarily natural gas and power positions  which includes near term positions managed under its asset management strategy through tolling agreements with the merchant generating fleet  but excludes the long dated positions created by the merchant generating fleet and associated coal  sulfur dioxide emission allowances  and other ancillary fuels 
var is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk 
the var amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
var models are relatively sophisticated 
however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used 
var is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
in addition to var  integrys energy services employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations and stress testing 
in conjunction with the var  these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for integrys energy services risk exposure 
integrys energy services var is estimated using a delta normal approximation based on an one day holding period and a confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day  are normally distributed 
integrys energy services var calculation includes derivative financial and commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options as well as commodities held in inventory  such as natural gas held in storage to the extent such positions are significant 
the var for integrys energy services trading portfolio is presented in the following table millions confidence level  one day holding period  one tailed december average for twelve months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the var amount for integrys energy services decreased million from december   to december  at december   the var reflected extreme price volatility in the market  post hurricane production shut ins  and unusual fluctuations in the various portfolios 
the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the var amounts at each of the four quarter ends 
interest rate risk integrys energy group and wpsc are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from their variable rate long term debt and short term borrowings 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
integrys energy group and wpsc enter into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so 
integrys energy group and wpsc may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
in the second quarter of  a variable rate non recourse debt instrument used to finance the purchase of sunbury was restructured to an integrys energy group obligation 
subsequent to the restructuring  an interest rate swap that had been used to fix the interest on the sunbury non recourse debt was re designated as a cash flow hedge  along with an additional interest rate swap  to fix the interest rate on the integrys energy group obligation 
due to increases in short term borrowings during  integrys energy group has increased its exposure to variable interest rates 
based on the variable rate debt of integrys energy group and wpsc outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points in would have increased annual interest expense in by approximately million at integrys energy group and million at wpsc 
comparatively  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense in by approximately million at integrys energy group and million at wpsc 
this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates  with no other changes for the remainder of the period 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would take action to mitigate integrys energy group s and wpsc s exposure to the change 
equity return and principal preservation risk integrys energy group and wpsc currently fund liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds 
the trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
integrys energy group maintains a qualified pension plan for employees retirement 
declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future pension costs for the plan and possible future required contributions 
changes in the market value of investments related to other employee benefits could also impact future contributions 
integrys energy group monitors the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
most of the employee benefit costs relate to integrys energy group s regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
foreign currency exchange rate risk integrys energy group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of foreign operations owned and operated in canada and transactions denominated in canadian dollars for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity by our nonregulated subsidiaries 
forward foreign exchange contracts are utilized to manage the risk associated with currency fluctuations on certain firm sales and sales commitments denominated in canadian dollars and certain canadian dollar denominated asset and liability positions 
integrys energy group s exposure to foreign currency risk was not significant at december   or
