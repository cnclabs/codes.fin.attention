item a 
risk factors 
carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form k  including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
if any of the events or developments described below were actually to occur  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
loss of revenues from tenants would reduce the company s cash flow 
the company s five largest tenants accounted for an aggregate of approximately percent of the company s annual base rent as of december  the default  financial distress or bankruptcy of one or more of the company s tenants could cause substantial vacancies among the company s investment portfolio 
vacancies reduce the company s revenues until the company is able to re lease the affected properties and could decrease the ultimate sale value of each such vacant property 
upon the expiration of the leases that are currently in place  the company may not be able to re lease a vacant property at a comparable lease rate or without incurring additional expenditures in connection with such re leasing 
a significant portion of the source of the company s annual base rent is heavily concentrated in a specific industry classification and in specific geographic locations 
as of december   an aggregate of approximately percent of the company s annual base rent is generated from two retail lines of trade  convenience stores and restaurants  each representing more than percent 
in addition  as of december   an aggregate of approximately percent of the company s annual base rent is generated from properties in texas and florida  each representing more than percent 
any financial hardship and or changes in these industries or states could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 

table of contents there are a number of risks inherent in owning real estate and indirect interests in real estate 
factors beyond the company s control affect the company s performance and value 
changes in national  regional and local economic and market conditions may affect the company s economic performance and the value of the company s real estate assets 
local real estate market conditions may include excess supply and intense competition for tenants  including competition based on rental rates and attractiveness and location of the property 
in addition  other factors may adversely affect the performance and value of the company s properties  including i changes in laws and governmental regulations  including those governing usage  zoning and taxes  ii changes in interest rates  and iii the availability of financing 
the company s real estate investments are illiquid 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  the company s ability to adjust the portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions is limited 
certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions  including i debt service if any  ii real estate taxes  and iii operating and maintenance costs 
this combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result  under certain market conditions  in reduced income from investment 
such reduction in investment income could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the company may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 
the company may acquire a property that contains some level of contamination or potential contamination exists  subject to a determination of the level of risk and potential cost of remediation 
investments in real property create a potential for substantial environmental liability on the part of the owner of such property from the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property  regardless of fault 
it is the company s policy  as a part of its acquisition due diligence process  generally to obtain an environmental site assessment for each property 
in such cases that the company intends to acquire real estate where contamination or potential contamination exists  the company generally requires the seller or tenant to i remediate the problem  ii indemnify the company for environmental liabilities  or iii agree to other arrangements deemed appropriate by the company to address environmental conditions at the property 
the company has investment properties currently under some level of environmental remediation 
in general  the seller  the tenant or an adjacent land owner is responsible for the cost of the environmental remediation for each of these investment properties 
in the event of a bankruptcy or other inability on the part of these parties to cover these costs  the company may have to cover the costs of remediation  fines or other environmental liabilities at these and other properties 
the company may also own properties where required remediation has not begun or adverse environmental conditions have not yet been detected 
this may require remediation or otherwise subject the company to liability 
the company cannot assure that i it will not be required to undertake or pay for removal or remediation of any contamination of the properties currently or previously owned by the company  ii the company will not be subject to fines by governmental authorities or litigation  or iii the costs of such removal  remediation fines or litigation would not be material 
the company may not be able to successfully execute its acquisition or development strategies 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to implement its investment strategies successfully 
additionally  the company cannot assure that its property portfolio will expand at all  or if it will 
table of contents expand at any specified rate or to any specified size 
in addition  investment in additional real estate assets is subject to a number of risks 
because the company expects to invest in markets other than the ones in which its current properties are located or which may be leased to tenants other than those to which the company has historically leased properties  the company will also be subject to the risks associated with investment in new markets or with new tenants that may be relatively unfamiliar to the company s management team 
the company s development activities are subject to without limitation  risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals  the cost and timely completion of construction including risks from factors beyond the company s control  such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages  the risk of finding tenants for the properties and the ability to obtain both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms 
these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and  under certain circumstances  could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken or provide a tenant the opportunity to terminate a lease 
any of these situations delay or eliminate proceeds or cash flows the company expects from these projects  which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the company may not be able to dispose of properties consistent with its operating strategy 
the company may be unable to sell properties targeted for disposition including its inventory properties at a profit if interest rates increase  or adverse market conditions exist  thereby  rendering the company unable to sell these properties 
a change in the assumptions used to determine the value of mortgage residual interests could adversely affect the company s financial position 
as of december   the residuals had a carrying value of  the value of these residuals is based on delinquency  loan loss  prepayment and interest rate assumptions made by the company to determine their value 
if actual experience differs materially from these assumptions  the actual future cash flow could be less than expected and the value of the residuals  as well as the company s earnings  could decline 
the company may suffer a loss in the event of a default or bankruptcy of a structured finance loan borrower 
if a borrower defaults on a structured finance loan and does not have sufficient assets to satisfy the loan  the company may suffer a loss of principal and interest 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower  the company may not be able to recover against all of the assets of the borrower  or the assets of the borrower may not be sufficient to satisfy the balance due on the loan 
in addition  certain of the company s loans may be subordinate to other debt of a borrower 
the structured finance agreements are typically loans secured by a borrower s pledge of its ownership interests in the entity that owns the real estate 
these agreements are typically subordinated to senior loans secured by first mortgages encumbering the underlying real estate 
subordinated positions are generally subject to a higher risk of nonpayment of principal and interest than the more senior loans 
as of december   the structured finance investments had an outstanding principal balance of  if a borrower defaults on the debt senior to the company s loan  or in the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower  the company s loan will be satisfied only after the borrower s senior creditors claims are satisfied 
where debt senior to the company s loans exists  the presence of intercreditor arrangements may limit the company s ability to amend loan documents  assign the loans  accept prepayments  exercise remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers 

table of contents bankruptcy proceedings and litigation can significantly increase the time needed for the company to acquire underlying collateral in the event of a default  during which time the collateral may decline in value 
in addition  there are significant costs and delays associated with the foreclosure process 
certain provisions of the leases or structured finance loan agreements may be unenforceable 
the company s rights and obligations with respect to its leases or structured finance loans are governed by written agreements 
a court could determine that one or more provisions of an agreement are unenforceable  such as a particular remedy  a loan prepayment provision or a provision governing the company s security interest in the underlying collateral of a borrower 
the company could be adversely impacted if this were to happen with respect to an asset or group of assets 
property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit the company s control of those investments 
joint ventures or partnerships involve risks not otherwise present for direct investments by the company 
it is possible that the company s co venturers or partners may have different interests or goals than the company at any time and they may take actions contrary to the company s requests  policies or objectives  including the company s policy with respect to maintaining its qualification as a reit 
other risks of joint venture investments include impasses on decisions  because no single co venturer or partner has full control over the joint venture or partnership 
competition with numerous other reits  commercial developers  real estate limited partnerships and other investors may impede the company s ability to grow 
the company may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on advantageous terms due to competition for such properties with others engaged in real estate investment activities 
the company s inability to successfully acquire new properties may affect the company s ability to achieve anticipated return on investment  which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
uninsured losses may adversely affect the company s ability to pay outstanding indebtedness 
the company s properties are generally covered by comprehensive liability  fire  flood  extended coverage and business interruption insurance 
the company believes that the insurance carried on its properties is adequate in accordance with industry standards 
there are  however  types of losses such as from hurricanes  wars or earthquakes which may be uninsurable  or the cost of insuring against these losses may not be economically justifiable 
if an uninsured loss occurs  the company could lose both the invested capital in and anticipated revenues from the property 
in that event  the company s cash flow could be reduced 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york city and washington  dc  on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which the company operates and the company s results of operations 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
these attacks may directly impact the company s physical facilities or the businesses of the company s tenants 

table of contents also  the united states has been engaged in armed conflict  which could have an impact on the company s tenants 
the consequences of armed conflict are unpredictable  and the company may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on its business 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economies 
they also could result in  or cause a deepening of  economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
vacant properties or bankrupt tenants could adversely affect the company 
as of december   the company owned nine vacant  unleased investment properties  which accounted for approximately two percent of the total gross leasable area of the company s investment portfolio and four unleased land parcels 
the company is actively marketing these properties for sale or lease but may not be able to sell or lease these properties on favorable terms or at all 
the lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from the rejection by any bankrupt tenant of any of their respective leases with the company could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations of the company if the company is unable to re lease the investment properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner 
less than one percent of the total gross leasable area of the company s investment portfolio is leased to one tenant that has filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  the tenant has the right to reject or affirm its lease with the company 
the amount of debt the company has and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect the company s business and financial condition 
as of december   the company had total mortgage debt and secured notes payable outstanding of approximately  total unsecured notes payable of  and  outstanding on the credit facility 
the company s organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that it may incur 
if the company incurs additional indebtedness and permits a higher degree of leverage  debt service requirements would increase and could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations  as well as the company s ability to pay principal and interest on the outstanding indebtedness or dividends to its stockholders 
in addition  increased leverage could increase the risk that the company may default on its debt obligations 
the credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions to the company s common and preferred stockholders 
the amount of debt outstanding at any time could have important consequences to the company s stockholders 
for example  it could require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on company debt  thereby reducing funds available for operations  real estate investments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future  limit the company s ability to obtain any additional financing it may need in the future for working capital  debt refinancing  capital expenditures  real estate investments  development or other general corporate purposes  make it difficult to satisfy the company s debt service requirements  
table of contents limit the company s ability to pay dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock  require the company to dedicate increased amounts of cash flow from operations to payments on its variable rate  unhedged debt if interest rates rise  limit the company s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the factors that affect the profitability of its business  and limit the company s flexibility in conducting its business  which may place the company at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on its debt  or to refinance such debt will depend primarily on its future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to the creditworthiness of its tenants  competition  as well as economic  financial  and other factors beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that the company s business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt or meet its other cash needs 
if the company is unable to generate this cash flow from its business  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its existing debt  sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet its debt obligations and other cash needs 
the company cannot assure you that any such refinancing  sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms and conditions  including but not limited to the interest rate  which the company would find acceptable 
the company is obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in its debt that could restrict its operating activities  and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment under its debt 
the company s unsecured debt contains various restrictive covenants which include  among others  provisions restricting the company s ability to incur or guarantee additional debt  make certain distributions  investments and other restricted payments  including dividend payments on its outstanding common and preferred stock  limit the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to the company  enter into transactions with certain affiliates  create certain liens  and consolidate  merge or sell the company s assets 
the company s secured debt generally contains customary covenants  including  among others  provisions relating to the maintenance of the property securing the debt  restricting its ability to sell  assign or further encumber the properties securing the debt  restricting its ability to incur additional debt  restricting its ability to amend or modify existing leases  and relating to certain prepayment restrictions 

table of contents the company s ability to meet some of the covenants in its debt  including covenants related to the condition of the property or payment of real estate taxes  may be dependent on the performance by the company s tenants under their leases 
in addition  certain covenants in the company s debt  including its credit facility  require the company and its subsidiaries  among other things  to maintain certain maximum leverage ratios  maintain certain minimum interest and debt service coverage ratios  limit dividends declared and paid to the company s common and preferred stockholders  and limit investments in certain types of assets 
the company s failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes could result in significant tax liability 
the company intends to operate in a manner that will allow the company to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit 
the company believes it has been organized as  and its past and present operations qualify the company as a reit 
however  the irs could successfully assert that the company is not qualified as such 
in addition  the company may not remain qualified as a reit in the future 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company s control 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit  it would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing taxable income and would become subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
in this event  the company could be subject to potentially significant tax liabilities 
unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  the company would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost 
even if the company maintains its reit status  the company may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and property 
compliance with reit requirements  including distribution requirements  may limit the company s flexibility and negatively affect the company s operating decisions 
to maintain its status as a reit for us federal income tax purposes  the company must meet certain requirements  on an on going basis  including requirements regarding its sources of income  the nature and diversification of its assets  the amounts the company distributes to its stockholders and the ownership of its shares 
the company may also be required to make distributions to its stockholders when it does not have funds readily available for distribution or at times when the company s funds are otherwise needed to fund capital expenditures or to fund debt service requirements 
the company generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on amounts distributed to stockholders  providing it distributes percent of its reit taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a reit 
for each of the years in the three year period ended december   the company believes it has qualified as a reit 
notwithstanding the company s qualification for taxation as a reit  the company is subject to certain state taxes on its income and real estate

the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit developed ffo as a relative non gaap financial measure of performance of a reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has 
table of contents not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
ffo is defined by nareit and is used by the company as follows net earnings computed in accordance with gaap plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry  excluding gains or including losses on the disposition of real estate held for investment  and the company s share of these items from the company s unconsolidated partnerships 
ffo is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of operating performance of real estate companies 
ffo does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of operating performance of an equity reit because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted it as an operating performance measure 
the company s computation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo used by other equity reits  and therefore  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the company has earnings from discontinued operations in each of its segments  investment assets and inventory assets  real estate held for investment and real estate held for sale 
all property dispositions from the company s investment segment are classified as discontinued operations 
in addition  certain properties in the company s inventory segment that have generated revenues before disposition are classified as discontinued operations 
these inventory properties have not historically been classified as discontinued operations  therefore  prior period comparable consolidated financial statements have been restated to include these properties in its earnings from discontinued operations 
these adjustments resulted in a decrease in the company s reported total revenues and total and per share earnings from continuing operations and an increase in the company s earnings from discontinued operations 
however  the company s total and per share net earnings available to common stockholders is not affected
