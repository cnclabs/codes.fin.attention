item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and operating philosophy regency is a qualified real estate investment trust reit  which began operations in our primary operating and investment goal is long term growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return  which we work to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning  operating and developing high quality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted by market dominant grocers  category leading anchors  specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities 
all of our operating  investing and financing activities are performed through our operating partnership  regency centers  lp rclp  rclp s wholly owned subsidiaries  and through its investments in joint ventures with third parties 
regency currently owns of the outstanding operating partnership units of rclp 
at december   we directly owned shopping centers the consolidated properties located in states representing million square feet of gross leasable area gla 
our cost of these shopping centers is billion before depreciation 
through joint ventures  we own partial interests in shopping centers the unconsolidated properties located in states and the district of columbia representing million square feet of gla 
our investment  at cost  in the unconsolidated properties is million 
certain portfolio information described below is presented a on a combined basis  which is a total of the consolidated properties and the unconsolidated properties  b for our consolidated properties only and c for the unconsolidated properties that we own through joint ventures 
we believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we wholly own versus those that we partially own  but for which we provide full property management  asset management  investing and financing services 
the shopping center portfolio that we manage  on a combined basis  represents shopping centers located in states and the district of columbia and contains million square feet of gla 
we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to market leading grocers  major retail anchors  specialty side shop retailers  and restaurants  including ground leasing or selling building pads out parcels to these tenants 
we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers  and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers 
community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering daily necessities and services 
this high traffic generates increased sales  thereby driving higher occupancy and rental rate growth  which we expect will sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 
we seek a range of strong national  regional and local specialty retailers  for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs 
we have created a formal partnering process the premier customer initiative pci to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our specialty retailers 
the objective of pci is for regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the best in class operators in their respective merchandising categories 
such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center s anchor  help to stabilize a center s occupancy  reduce re leasing downtime  reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 
we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development  where we acquire the land and construct the building 
development is customer driven  meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction 
developments serve the growth needs of our anchors  and specialty retailers  resulting in modern shopping centers with long term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital 
this development process can require up to months  or longer  from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction  lease up and stabilization of rental income  depending upon the size of the project 
generally  anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center  resulting in rental income during the development phase 

table of contents we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth programs  which should preserve our investment grade ratings 
our approach is founded on our self funding business model 
this model utilizes center recycling as a key component  which requires ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it continues to meet our investment standards 
we sell the operating properties that no longer measure up to our standards 
we also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive profit margins with the intent of selling them to joint ventures or other third parties upon completion 
these sale proceeds are re deployed into new  higher quality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns 
joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new developments and acquisitions  as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services 
as asset manager  we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating  investment  and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the joint ventures 
joint ventures grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from regency 
although selling properties to joint ventures reduces our ownership interest  we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our high quality standards and long term investment strategy 
we have no obligations or liabilities of the joint ventures beyond our ownership interest percentage 
we have identified certain significant risks and challenges affecting our industry  and we are addressing them accordingly 
an economic downturn could result in declines in occupancy levels at our shopping centers  which would reduce our rental revenues  however  we believe that our investment focus on neighborhood and community shopping centers that conveniently provide daily necessities will minimize the impact of a downturn in the economy 
increased competition from super centers and industry consolidation could result in retailer store closings  however  we closely monitor the operating performance and tenants sales in our shopping centers that operate near super centers as well as those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition or business practice 
we also continue to monitor retail trends and merchandise our shopping centers based on consumer demand 
a significant slowdown in retailer demand for new stores could cause a corresponding reduction in our shopping center development program that would likely reduce our future rental revenues and profits from development sales  as well as  increase our operating expenses as a result of reducing our capitalized employee costs see critical accounting policies and estimates capitalization of costs described further below 
however  based upon our current pipeline of development projects undergoing due diligence  which is our best indication of retailer expansion plans  the presence of our development teams in key markets in combination with their excellent relationships with leading anchor tenants  we believe that we will be able to sustain our development program at current averages in the foreseeable three to five year period 

table of contents shopping center portfolio the following tables summarize general operating statistics related to our shopping center portfolio  which we use to evaluate and monitor our performance

b gla and annualized base rent include the consolidated properties plus regency s pro rata share of the unconsolidated properties 
although base rent is supported by long term lease contracts  tenants who file bankruptcy are able to cancel their leases and close their related stores 
in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases  we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues 
we continually monitor industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties 
we continue to monitor the video rental industry while its operators transition to different rental formats including on line rental programs 
at december   we had leases with video rental stores representing million of annual rental income pertaining to consolidated properties and our pro rata share of the unconsolidated properties 
we are not aware at this time of the current or pending bankruptcy of any of our tenants that would cause a significant reduction in our revenues  and no tenant represents more than of the total of our annual base rental revenues and our pro rata share of the base revenues of the unconsolidated properties 
liquidity and capital resources we expect that cash generated from operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our operating expenses  interest expense  scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our shopping centers  and dividends to stockholders 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  and  we incurred capital expenditures of million  million and million to improve our shopping centers  we paid scheduled principal payments of million  million and million to our lenders on mortgage loans  and we paid dividends to our stockholders and unit holders of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in dividends during was primarily related to a million equity offering completed during  as described below under equity capital transactions  and an increase in our annual dividend rate of 
we intend to continue to grow our portfolio by investing in shopping centers through ground up development of new centers or acquisition of existing centers 
because development and acquisition activities are discretionary in nature  they are not expected to burden the capital resources we have currently available for liquidity requirements 
we expect to meet our long term capital investment requirements for development and acquisitions  as well as  the redemption of preferred stock and the repayment of maturing debt from i residual cash generated from operating activities after the payments described above  ii proceeds from the sale of real estate  iii joint venturing of real estate  iv refinancing of debt  and v equity raised in the capital markets 

table of contents the following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating  investing and financing activities in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and equivalents at december   we had an unlimited amount under our shelf registration for equity securities based on the new securities and exchange commission sec rules and rclp had million available for debt under its shelf registration 
we believe that our ability to access the capital markets as a source of funds to meet capital requirements is good 
at december  we had properties under construction or undergoing major renovations on a combined basis  which when completed  will represent a net investment of billion after projected sales of adjacent land and out parcels 
this compares to projects that were under construction at the end of representing an investment of million upon completion 
we estimate that we will earn an average return on our investment on our current development projects of on a fully allocated basis including direct internal costs and the cost to acquire any residual interests held by minority development partners 
these average returns are approximately basis points less than the projected yields on the developments that were under construction at the end of  which is primarily the result of higher costs associated with the acquisition of land and construction 
while the average return on investment has declined from historical levels  the company believes that our development returns are sufficient on a risk adjusted basis 
costs necessary to complete the current development projects  net of projected land sales are estimated to be million and will likely be expended through the costs to complete these developments will be funded from our million line of credit  which had million of available funding at december   and from expected proceeds from the future sale of shopping centers as part of the capital recycling program described above 
in february  we increased the commitment of our line of credit to million with the ability to expand it to million as discussed further below in notes payable

table of contents equity transactions from time to time  we issue equity in the form of exchangeable operating partnership units or preferred units of rclp  or in the form of common or preferred stock of regency centers corporation 
as previously discussed  these sources of long term equity financing allow us to fund our growth while maintaining a conservative capital structure 
preferred units we have issued preferred units in various amounts since  the net proceeds of which were used to reduce the balance of the line 
we issue preferred units primarily to institutional investors in private placements 
generally  the preferred units may be exchanged by the holders for cumulative redeemable preferred stock at an exchange rate of one share for one unit 
the preferred units and the related preferred stock are not convertible into regency common stock 
at december  and  only the series d preferred units were outstanding with a face value of million and a fixed distribution rate of 
these units may be called by us in  and have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption 
included in the series d preferred units are original issuance costs of  that will be expensed if they are redeemed in the future 
preferred stock as of december  we had three series of preferred stock outstanding  two of which underlie depositary shares held by the public 
the depositary shares each represent th of a share of the underlying preferred stock and have a liquidation preference of per depository share 
in  we issued series cumulative redeemable preferred stock underlying million depositary shares 
in  we issued series cumulative redeemable preferred stock underlying million depositary shares 
in  we issued million shares  or million of series preferred stock  with a liquidation preference of per share 
all series of preferred stock are perpetual  are not convertible into common stock of the company and are redeemable at par upon our election five years after the issuance date 
the terms of the preferred stock do not contain any unconditional obligations that would require us to redeem the securities at any time or for any purpose 
common stock on april   we entered into an agreement to sell  shares of common stock to an affiliate of citigroup global markets inc citigroup at per share  in connection with a forward sale agreement the forward sale agreement 
on august   we issued  shares to citigroup for net proceeds of approximately million and on september   the remaining  shares were issued for net proceeds of million 
the proceeds from these sales were used to reduce the unsecured line of credit and redeem the series e and series f preferred units 
critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results  and discussion and analysis of these results 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based upon  but not limited to  our judgments about historical results  current economic activity  and industry accounting standards 
they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness 
however  the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition and tenant receivables tenant receivables represent revenues recognized in our financial statements  and include base rent  percentage rent  and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes 
we analyze tenant receivables  historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  we analyze the accounts of tenants in bankruptcy  and we estimate the recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
our reported net income is directly affected by our estimate of the recoverability of tenant receivables 
recognition of gains from the sales of real estate we account for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance with sfas statement no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
profits from sales of real estate will not be recognized by us unless i a sale has been consummated  ii the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  iii we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and iv we do not have significant continuing involvement with the property 
recognition of gains from sales to joint ventures is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest 
capitalization of costs we capitalize the acquisition of land  the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development on our consolidated balance sheets 
other development costs include pre development costs essential to the development of the property  as well as  interest  real estate taxes  and direct employee costs incurred during the development period 
pre development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits  legal  engineering and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center 
if we were to determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence was no longer probable  we would immediately expense all related capitalized pre development costs not considered recoverable 
interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended 
we cease interest capitalization when the property is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements 
we have a large staff of employees who support the due diligence  land acquisition  construction  leasing  financial analysis and accounting of our development program 
all direct internal costs related to development activities are capitalized as part of each development project 
if future accounting standards limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized  or if our development activity were to decline significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs  we could incur a significant increase in our operating expenses 
real estate acquisitions upon acquisition of operating real estate properties  we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets  liabilities consisting of above and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations statement 
based on these estimates  we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities 
we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful life 
valuation of real estate investments our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
the review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods such as i estimating future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate  tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores 
if we determine that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we will write down the asset to fair value for held and used assets and to fair value less costs to sell for held for sale assets 

table of contents discontinued operations the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held for sale on the balance sheet  or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued  requires management to make certain significant judgments 
in evaluating whether a property meets the criteria set forth by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets statement  the company makes a determination as to the point in time that it can be reasonably certain that a sale will be consummated 
given the nature of all real estate sales contracts  it is not unusual for such contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract 
in addition  certain other matters critical to the final sale  such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance 
as a result  properties under contract may not close within the expected time period  or may not close at all 
due to these uncertainties  it is not likely that the company can meet the criteria of statement prior to the sale formally closing 
therefore  any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are likely to close within the requirements set forth in statement the company also makes judgments regarding the extent of involvement it will have with a property subsequent to its sale  in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued 
consistent with statement  any property sold to an entity in which the company has significant continuing involvement most often joint ventures is not considered to be discontinued 
in addition  any property which the company sells to an unrelated third party  but retains a property or asset management function  is also not considered discontinued 
therefore  only properties sold  or to be sold  to unrelated third parties that the company  in its judgment  has no significant continuing involvement with are classified as discontinued 
investments in real estate joint ventures in addition to owning real estate directly  we invest in real estate through our co investment joint ventures 
joint venturing provides us with a capital source to acquire real estate  and to earn our pro rata share of the net income from the joint ventures in addition to fees for services 
as asset and property manager  we conduct the business of the unconsolidated properties held in the joint ventures in the same way that we conduct the business of the consolidated properties that are wholly owned  therefore  the critical accounting policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the joint ventures

income tax status the prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that we will continue to operate in order to qualify as a reit  as defined under the internal revenue code 
we are required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that we continue to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders 
we evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our reit status 
determining our taxable income  calculating distributions  and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the internal revenue code 
because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations  our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities

environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry  the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers  and underground petroleum storage tanks ust s 
we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and 
table of contents regulations 
generally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to non chlorinated solvent systems 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against third party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination 
we have also placed environmental insurance  where possible  on specific properties with known contamination  in order to mitigate our environmental risk 
we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites 
we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 
we estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be approximately million  all of which has been reserved 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material affect on our financial position  liquidity  or operations  however  we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  that any previous owner  occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by unrelated third parties  or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers  however  substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily related to the variable interest rate on the line and the refinancing of long term debt  which currently contain fixed interest rates 
the objective of our interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands  weighted average interest rates of remaining debt  and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december   by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate for all fixed rate debt variable rate libor debt average interest rate for all variable rate debt we currently have million of fixed rate debt maturing in and on march   the company entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps totaling million with fixed rates of   and 
the company designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to fix million of fixed rate financing expected to occur in and  the proceeds of which will be used to repay debt maturing in those years 
the change in fair value of these swaps from inception has generated a liability of million at december   which is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented above has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and actual interest rates
