item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company develops  produces  markets and sells innovative  over the counter otc healthcare products with an emphasis on those that utilize unique  novel and or proprietary delivery systems that provide consumers with better ways to get better 
the company currently markets its products within the billion overall cough and cold category at retail 
our zicam products are sold in the cold nasal delivery products and oral delivery products  allergy sinus zicam nasal delivery  cough cough sprays and rapidmelt tablets  and multi symptom relief oral delivery products market groups of the overall cough and cold category 
our nasal comfort products are generally sold within the space allocated for allergy and sinus products at retail 
we expect that our mix of products sold will change due to seasonality and varying growth rates within the market groups 
our products are currently available at all of the major food  drug  and mass merchant retailers 
the following table details our sales by product class with further details below product class cold remedy allergy sinus nasal comfort cough multi symptom cold flu   n a total net sales net sales for increased to approximately million  or above net sales in of million 
the increase in net sales is primarily attributable to increased sales of our cold remedy line of products  which 
table of contents include the two new zicam cold remedy items that we began shipping in the third quarter of zicam cold remedy rapidmelts vitamin c and zicam cold remedy chewcaps 
sales of zicam cold remedy products grew and represented approximately of our net sales 
additionally  sales of allergy sinus products grew in  returns of nasal comfort products in exceeded sales by approximately  cough and multi symptom cold flu product sales declined approximately and  respectively  in we began television advertising of our cough and multi symptom cold flu products in january of we expect the zicam brand will continue to grow as we promote consumer awareness of our products  increase distribution of our products  and introduce new items 
net income for was approximately million compared to million in net income for included the impact of settling the arizona litigation and recording a reserve for the remaining product liability lawsuits 
the settlement impact was million to settle the arizona litigation and million as a reserve for the remaining litigation  less approximately million for insurance reimbursement  resulting in an million million net of tax charge see part i  item legal proceedings 
we expect net income in future periods will be significantly affected by the level of sales  the timing and amount of our advertising and research and development expenses  and the timing and amount of expenses incurred in the defense of product liability matters 
expenditures for advertising and research and development will vary by quarter throughout the year and could be significantly different in future periods than the amounts incurred in the same period in earlier years 
we expect that advertising expenses will be highest in the fourth and first calendar quarters in conjunction with the cough and cold season 
we anticipate quarterly earnings will continue to vary along with the seasonality of sales and the level of marketing and research and development activities 
because of the seasonality of our business  our board of directors has approved a change in our fiscal year in order to better align our operations and financial results with the entire cold season our current fiscal year ends in the middle of the cold season 
our new fiscal year will begin april  and end on march  as in prior years  we believe the second calendar quarter of will result in a loss 
the company s management reviews several key indicators in evaluating overall performance we compare our year to date sales and net income performance against our stated annual goal for each 
for fiscal  our stated goal was to grow sales to and net income to above the level realized in excluding the impact of an million charge  net of expected recovery from insurance programs  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal for settling the arizona litigation and recording a reserve for the remaining product liability lawsuits 
we realized net sales growth of in we believe the lower than expected sales growth is attributable to a slow start to the cold season  sales of cough and multi symptom cold flu items not achieving expected growth rates  and low acceptance of nasal comfort 
the lower than originally anticipated net income growth is directly related to the lower sales growth we recorded 
we monitor our share of the cough and cold market 
for the weeks ended december   retail sales of our products as measured by three outlet syndicated scanner data  not including our largest customer  wal mart increased approximately over the comparable period in the previous year  while the entire cough and cold category increased approximately over the same period 
the increased sales of our products for the weeks ended december  achieved a share of approximately of the entire cough and cold market compared to a share of in  and in we measure our ability to maintain strong gross margins on our products 
during  we achieved an average gross margin of  which is below our goal of  and below the average gross margin of realized in gross margins on our existing products vary between and 
average gross margins in were negatively impacted by higher than expected returns of nasal comfort and discontinued items  as well as start up costs related to new products and enhancements to existing items 
we evaluate our operating performance by reviewing  over time  our ability to decrease administrative and general costs as a percentage of net sales 
for  our operating expenses excluding r d and product liability litigation related charges were approximately of our net sales compared to in operating expenses for the year  as a percentage of net sales  have been negatively impacted by lower than

additionally  in  we recorded approximately  or of net sales  for expense related to responding to the ftc inquiry  which the ftc recently advised us it is no longer pursuing see part i  item legal proceedings ftc inquiry 
we review the distribution of our products by key national retailers 
our ten largest retail customers based on sales carry  on average  of our products zicam nasal comfort 
those customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in and of net sales in seasonality and quarterly results the products we currently market are seasonal in nature  and sales at retail generally increase as the level of population suffering from colds rises 
the company records sales when we ship products from our warehouse facilities 
during the third calendar quarter  the company usually realizes increased sales volume as retailers stock our products and order displays to prepare for the upcoming cough and cold season 
additional sales re orders to retailers are highly dependent upon the incidence of illness within the population 
retail consumption of our products is highest during the cough and cold season  which usually runs from october through march 
the company begins extensive advertising campaigns to coincide with the cough and cold season and generally realizes higher advertising expense in the fourth and first quarters of each year 
the april to june quarter of each year generally accounts for less than of annual sales 
further  the company records the expense for annual bonuses awards when goal attainment for the bonus is reached  which is generally reflected in fourth quarter results 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year

q q q q fy ns ns ns ns ns s net sales marketing sales expense general administrative legal product liability total op expenses r d critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  revenue recognition  accounting for sales returns and allowances associated with our products  and accounting for legal contingencies 
intangible assets and goodwill we recorded approximately million in goodwill in connection with the zicam  llc interest acquired from zensano  inc in december under sfas no 
 goodwill must be tested when a triggering event occurs or at least annually to identify a potential impairment and the amount of any impairment loss 
factors that could affect this analysis would be significant loss of market share  a general decline in zicam product sales  higher than expected increases in expenses and various other matters 
any change in key assumptions about the business or prospects of zicam  llc  or any change in market conditions or other externalities affecting zicam  llc  could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our annual valuation of goodwill was completed in the third quarter of and no impairment was identified 
no triggering events have occurred subsequent to the valuation performed in the third quarter of income taxes in and  we recorded income tax expense based on our estimated effective income tax rate for the year and will continue to do so in future periods 
in  we fully utilized the tax loss carryforward from prior years 
in  we recognized a tax benefit related to the charitable donation of cough products in the second quarter of we ended with a tax loss carryforward that we expect to fully utilize in revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when earned  that is  when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is considered to have occurred upon shipment of finished product 
sales incentives  promotional allowances  and returns are estimated and recognized at 
table of contents the date of shipment based upon historical activity and agreements with customers 
the company evaluates these estimates on a monthly basis and revises them as necessary 
customer sales returns and allowances the estimate for product returns reflects our historical experience of sales to retailers and is reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects potential product returns 
prior to july  we recorded a returns provision of for products in distribution over a year and for new items 
we regularly review the similarities and differences of the new products relative to products for which we now have several years of product return experience 
in july  we adjusted our returns provision to of gross sales for all of our products  including the new items that began shipping in the third quarter of additionally  during  we recorded a million adjustment to our returns provision to account for increased returns of nasal comfort and discontinued products from a large customer 
we will review the return provision at least quarterly and adjust the reserve amounts as actual product return experience continues to develop 
should the actual level of product returns vary significantly from our estimates  our operating and financial results would be materially affected 
legal contingencies we are subject to lawsuits  investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of our business 
see part i  item legal proceedings for information regarding our pending litigation 
while we are vigorously defending ourself in these proceedings  the outcome of these and any other proceedings that may arise cannot be predicted with certainty 
at the end of fiscal  the company has established a reserve of approximately million solely for any future payment of settlement or losses related to the cold remedy litigation 
this reserve was based on certain assumptions and was the amount that the company believed that it could reasonably estimate would be spent to resolve the remaining cases 
some of the significant factors that were considered in the establishment of the reserve were the actual costs incurred by the company up to that time in resolving several claims  the development of the company s legal defense strategy and structure in light of the arizona settlement  and the number of cases that remain pending against the company 
there are events  such as the dismissal of any cases  the outcome of a trial  or rulings on pending evidentiary motions  that may have an impact on the company s conclusions as to the adequacy of the reserves for the pending product liability lawsuits 
based on the number of pending and settled cases  the company maintained a reserve of approximately million on december  the company will continue to review the adequacy of the associated reserves on a quarterly basis 
the company followed the guidance of sfas  accounting for contingencies  which states the company is required to accrue a contingent loss when the loss is deemed probable

the company records an estimated allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts  which is reviewed on a monthly basis 
we believe our allowance as of december  is adequate 
the change in accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses largely reflects the increase in the company s business and reflects the seasonal nature of the company s business 
the company records the bulk of its sales  which is reflected in higher accounts receivable  in the third  fourth and first calendar quarters  builds inventory during the second through fourth quarter periods  and advertises its products  which is the largest component of accrued expenses  in the fourth and first quarters 
although affected by the build up of inventory in the second through fourth quarters  accounts payable and accrued expenses are more significantly affected by advertising spending  which largely occurs in the fourth and first quarters

the terms of the program required us to maintain an irrevocable  evergreen letter of credit issued by a bank or other financial institution to secure our reimbursement obligations to our insurer 
we had a million letter of credit with comerica bank and had reserved an equal amount of cash to secure repayments of amounts that become due under the letter of credit 
the million reserve was classified as restricted cash on the december  consolidated balance sheet and was invested in an interest bearing certificate of deposit 
the settlement of the consolidated arizona litigation in january of exhausted this policy 
in april  we replaced the self funded insurance program with a limited traditional insurance program 
this new insurance program does not cover lawsuits existing prior to april  and only applies to any new claims made after the new policy became effective 
the new policy requires a  letter of credit instead of a million letter of credit  as was required under the previous policy 
we have a million credit facility with comerica bank that was renewed in and expires in july the interest rate under the new credit facility is prime plus or at december  
in july  we borrowed million under the facility to support our working capital requirements in the third quarter of we fully repaid the debt in the fourth quarter of we are in compliance with the earnings and financial covenants contained in the credit facility

in july  we borrowed million against our credit facility with comerica bank 
the primary purpose for the borrowing was to provide additional liquidity as we built inventory for expected increases in sales during the second half of we generally extend payment terms for customers during the third quarter as customers purchase new products and build inventory for the upcoming cough and cold season 
we repaid the debt in the fourth quarter of and ended fiscal with no debt 
consequently  we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position in the foreseeable future 
as of december  and december   we did not participate in any market risk sensitive commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk or foreign customer purchases of which there were none in fiscal or commodity price risk
