item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on december   we issued a press release and held a conference call to review the results of operations for our fiscal year ended october  and to discuss the current state of our business 
the information contained in this report is the same information given in the press release and on the conference call on december   and we are not reconfirming or updating that information 
overview in fiscal  we recognized billion of revenues  as compared to billion of revenues in fiscal and billion in fiscal net income in fiscal was million  as compared to million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we recognized million of inventory impairment charges and write offs in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  we recognized million of impairment charges on two of our investments in unconsolidated entities in our quarter ended october  and a million goodwill impairment charge in our quarter ended january  in our quarter ended october   we recorded our first loss since becoming a public company in this loss was due to the continued deterioration of the market that resulted in inventory impairment charges and write offs in our quarter ended october  of million and the aforementioned million of impairment charges related to two of our investments in unconsolidated entities 
the impairment charges and write offs recognized on inventory and investments in unconsolidated entities in the quarter were primarily located in our arizona  california  florida  nevada  and washington  dc markets 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing throughout fiscal and and into the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced a slowdown in new contracts signed 
the value of net new contracts signed in fiscal of billion  homes was a decline of from the value of net new contracts signed in fiscal and a decline of from the value of net new contracts signed in fiscal our backlog of billion at october  decreased compared to our backlog of billion at october  and decreased compared to our backlog of billion at october  backlog includes a the value of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers which are accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting  and b the value of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers for which we use the percentage of completion accounting method less the amount of revenues we have recognized related to those homes 
we believe this slowdown is attributable to a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes  an oversupply of homes available for sale  the inability of some of our home buyers to sell their current home and the direct and indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market 
we attribute the reduction in demand to concerns on the part of prospective home buyers about the direction of home prices  due in part to the constant media attention with regard to the potential of mortgage foreclosures  many home builders advertising price reductions and increased sales incentives  and concerns by prospective home buyers about being able to sell their existing homes 
in addition  we believe speculators and investors are no longer helping to fuel demand 
we try to avoid selling homes to speculators  and we generally do not build detached homes without having a signed agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from a buyer 
nonetheless  we have been impacted by an overall increase in the supply of homes available for sale in many markets  as speculators attempt to sell the homes they previously purchased or cancel contracts for homes under construction  and as those builders that as part of their business strategy were building homes in anticipation of capturing additional sales in a demand driven market  attempt to reduce their inventories by lowering prices and adding incentives 
in addition  based on the high cancellation rates reported by us and by other builders  non speculative buyer cancellations are also adding to the supply of homes in the marketplace 
during fiscal  and  our customers signed gross contracts of   and  respectively 
they cancelled   and contracts during fiscal  and  respectively 
contract cancellations include contracts signed in the fiscal year reported as well as contracts signed in prior fiscal years 
when we report contracts signed  the number and value of contracts signed is reported net of any cancellations occurring during the reporting period  whether signed in that reporting period or in a prior period 
only outstanding agreements of sale that have been signed by both the home buyer and us as of the 
table of contents end of the period on which we are reporting are included in backlog 
of the value of backlog reported on october   and  home buyers subsequently cancelled approximately  and  respectively 
despite this slowdown  we believe our industry demographics remain strong due to the continuing regulation induced constraints on lot supplies and the growing number of affluent households 
we continue to seek a balance between our short term goal of selling homes in a tough market and our long term goal of maximizing the value of our communities 
we believe that many of our communities are in locations that are difficult to replace and in markets where approvals are increasingly difficult to achieve 
we believe that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that will be realizable in the future and that this value should not necessarily be sacrificed in the current soft market 
we are concerned about the dislocation in the secondary mortgage market 
we maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage providers  most of which are among the largest and  we believe  most reliable in our industry 
with few exceptions  the mortgage providers that provide our customers with mortgages continue to issue new commitments 
our buyers generally have been able to obtain adequate financing 
nevertheless  tightening credit standards will likely shrink the pool of potential home buyers 
mortgage market liquidity issues and higher borrowing rates may impede some of our home buyers from closing  while others may find it more difficult to sell their existing homes as their buyers face the problem of obtaining a mortgage 
however  we believe that our buyers generally should be able to continue to secure mortgages  due to their typically lower loan to value ratios and attractive credit profiles compared to the average american home buyer 
although we cannot predict the short and long term liquidity of the loan markets  we caution that  with the uncertainties in the mortgage markets right now  the pace of home sales could slow further until the credit markets settle down 
in the current challenging environment  we believe our access to reliable capital and our strong balance sheet give us an important competitive advantage 
based on our experience during prior downturns in the housing market  we have learned that unexpected opportunities may arise in difficult times for those that are well prepared 
we believe that our solid financial base  our broad geographic presence  our diversified product lines and our national brand name all position us well for such opportunities now and in the future 
at october   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately billion available under our bank revolving credit facility which extends to march  we believe we have the resources available to fund these opportunities 
notwithstanding the current market conditions  we believe geographic and product diversification  access to lower cost capital  and strong demographics have in the past and will in the future  as market conditions improve  benefit those builders that can control land and persevere through the increasingly difficult regulatory approval process 
we believe that this evolution in our industry favors the large publicly traded home building companies with the capital and expertise to control home sites and gain market share 
we believe that as home builders reduce the number of home sites being taken through the approval process and the process continues to become more difficult  and as the political pressure from no growth proponents continues to increase  our expertise in taking land through the approval process and our already approved land positions will allow us to grow in the years to come  as market conditions improve 
because of the length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property  complete the land improvements on it  and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale  we are subject to many risks 
we attempt to reduce certain risks by controlling land for future development through options whenever possible  thus allowing us to obtain the necessary governmental approvals before acquiring title to the land  generally commencing construction of a detached home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from a buyer  and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed price basis 
in response to current market conditions  we have been reevaluating and renegotiating many of our optioned land positions 
as a result  we have reduced our land position from a high of approximately  at april  to approximately  lots at october  in the ordinary course of doing business  we must make estimates and judgments that affect decisions on how we operate and on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  those related to the recognition of income and expenses  impairment of assets  estimates of future improvement and amenity costs  capitalization of costs to inventory  provisions for litigation  insurance and 
table of contents warranty costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate and adjust our estimates based on the information currently available 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions or conditions 
at october   we were selling from communities compared to communities at october  we expect to be selling from approximately communities at october  given the current business climate that we are operating in and the numerous uncertainties related to sales paces  sales prices  mortgage markets  cancellations  market direction and the potential for and size of future impairments  it is difficult to provide guidance for fiscal subject to our caveats and risks reported elsewhere and the preceding caveats  we currently estimate that we will deliver between  and  homes in fiscal at an average home price of between  and  per home 
we believe that  as a result of continuing incentives and slower sales per community  our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues  before taking into account write downs  will be higher in fiscal than in fiscal additionally  based on fiscal s lower projected revenues  our selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  which we expect to be lower in absolute amounts in fiscal than in fiscal  will likely be higher as a percentage of revenues 
the foregoing estimates are identical to those given in our press release and conference call on december  and we are not reconfirming or updating those estimates herein 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
in addition to direct land acquisition  land development and home construction costs  costs include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead related to development and construction  which are capitalized to inventories during the period beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction 
once a parcel of land has been approved for development  it generally takes four to five years to fully develop  sell and deliver all the homes in one of our typical communities 
longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community and the sales and delivery pace of the homes in a community 
our master planned communities  consisting of several smaller communities  may take up to ten years or more to complete 
because of the downturn in our business  the aforementioned estimated community lives may be significantly longer 
because our inventory is considered a long lived asset under us generally accepted accounting principles  we are required  under sfas  to regularly review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities for which we believe the values are not recoverable 
current communities when the profitability of a current community deteriorates  the sales pace declines significantly or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset  the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flow for the community to its carrying value 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flow is less than the community s carrying value  the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value 
fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community 
the impairment is charged to cost of revenues in the period the impairment is determined 
in estimating the cash flow of a community  we use various estimates such as a the expected sales pace in a community based upon general economic conditions that will have a short term or long term impact on the market in which the community is located and competition within the market  including the number of homes home sites available and pricing and incentives being offered in other communities owned by us or by other builders  b the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community  c costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future  including  but not limited to  land and land development costs  home construction costs  interest costs and overhead costs  d alternative product offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace  sales price  building cost or the number of homes that 
table of contents can be built on a particular site  and e alternative uses for the property such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites 
future communities we evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of current communities  whether owned or under contract  to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated 
this evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for current communities described above as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals  the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain the approvals and the possible concessions that will be required to be given in order to obtain them 
concessions may include cash payments to fund improvement to public places such as parks and streets  dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built 
based upon this review  we decide a as to land under contract to be purchased  whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated  and b as to land we own  whether the land will likely be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner  or should be sold 
we then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off 
the write off is charged to cost of revenues in the period that the need for the write off is determined 
the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of a community are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future  we may be required to recognize additional write downs write offs related to current and future communities 
variable interest entities we have a significant number of land purchase contracts  sometimes referred to herein as land purchase contracts  purchase agreements  options or option agreements  and several investments in unconsolidated entities which we evaluate in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 as amended by fin r fin 
pursuant to fin  an enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected residual returns of a variable interest entity vie is considered to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
a vie is an entity with insufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors lack some of the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
for land purchase contracts with sellers meeting the definition of a vie  we perform a review to determine which party is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
this review requires substantial judgment and estimation 
these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the entity s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of the land under contract 
at october   we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of two vies related to land purchase contracts and recorded inventory of million and accrued expenses of million 
revenue and cost recognition home sales completed contract method the construction time of our homes is generally less than one year  although some may take more than one year to complete 
revenues and cost of revenues from these home sales are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer 
closing normally occurs shortly after construction is substantially completed 
in addition  we have several high rise mid rise projects which do not qualify for percentage of completion accounting in accordance sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas  which are included in this category of revenues and costs 
land  land development  home construction and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
the estimated land  common area development and related costs of master planned communities  including the cost of golf courses  net of their estimated residual value  are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis 
any changes resulting from a 
table of contents change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master planned community 
home sales percentage of completion method we are developing several high rise mid rise projects that will take substantially more than one year to complete 
under the provisions of sfas  revenues and costs for these projects are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting when construction is beyond the preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for nondelivery of the unit  sufficient units in the project have been sold to ensure that the property will not be converted to rental property  the sales proceeds are collectible and the aggregate sales proceeds and the total cost of the project can be reasonably estimated 
revenues and costs of individual projects are recognized on the individual project s aggregate value of units for which the home buyers have signed binding agreements of sale  less an allowance for cancellations  and are based on the percentage of total estimated construction costs that have been incurred 
total estimated revenues and construction costs are reviewed periodically  and any change is applied to current and future periods 
land sales land sales revenues and cost of revenues are recorded at the time that title and possession of the property have been transferred to the buyer 
we recognize the pro rata share of land sales revenues and cost of land sales revenues to entities in which we have a or less interest based upon the ownership percentage attributable to the non company investors 
any profit not recognized in a transaction reduces our investment in the entity or is recorded as an accrued liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
off balance sheet arrangements we have investments in and advances to several joint ventures and to toll brothers realty trust group trust and toll brothers realty trust group ii trust ii 
at october   we had investments in and advances to these entities of million  were committed to invest or advance an additional million in the aggregate to these entities if needed and had guaranteed approximately million of these entities indebtedness and or loan commitments 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities and related party transactions for more information regarding these entities 
our investments in these entities are accounted for using the equity method 

table of contents results of operations the following table compares certain income statement items related to our operations amounts in millions revenues completed contract percentage of completion land sales costs of revenues completed contract percentage of completion land sales interest selling  general and administrative goodwill impairment loss income from operations loss earnings from unconsolidated entities interest and other expenses related to early retirement of debt income before income taxes income taxes net income note percentages for cost of revenues for completed contract  percentage of completion and land sales are based on the corresponding item under revenues 
percentages for interest expense and selling  general and administrative expenses are based on total revenues 
amounts may not add due to rounding 
fiscal compared to fiscal unless otherwise stated  contracts signed represents a number or amount equal to the gross number or amount of contracts signed during the relevant period  less the number or amount of contracts cancelled during the relevant period  which includes contracts that were signed during the relevant period and contracts signed in prior periods 
revenues and costs completed contract revenues for fiscal were lower than those of fiscal by approximately billion  or 
the decrease was attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered and a decrease in the average price of the homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered was primarily due to the lower backlog of homes at october  as compared to october   which was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of contracts signed in fiscal versus fiscal  and a decline of in the number of contracts signed in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in the average price of the homes delivered was due primarily to the increased sales incentives given to buyers on the homes delivered in fiscal as compared to fiscal offset in part by a slight change in the mix of homes delivered to higher priced homes 
the value of contracts signed in fiscal was billion  homes 
this represented a decrease compared to the value of contracts signed in fiscal of billion  homes 
the decrease was 
table of contents attributable to a decrease in the number of contracts signed in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and a decrease in the average value of each contract signed in fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe the decrease in the number of contracts signed is attributable to the increased number of cancellations  a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes and an oversupply of homes available for sale 
the value of contracts cancelled in fiscal including those signed in fiscal and those signed in prior periods but not cancelled until fiscal as a percentage of the gross value of contracts signed in fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal we believe this slowdown is attributable to a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes  an oversupply of homes available for sale  the inability of some of our home buyers to sell their current home and the direct and indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market 
we attribute the reduction in demand to concerns on the part of prospective home buyers about the direction of home prices  due in part to the constant media attention with regard to the potential of mortgage foreclosures  many home builders advertising price reductions and increased sales incentives  and concerns by prospective home buyers about being able to sell their existing homes 
in addition  we believe speculators and investors are no longer helping to fuel demand 
we try to avoid selling homes to speculators  and we generally do not build detached homes without having a signed agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from a buyer 
nonetheless  we have been impacted by an overall increase in the supply of homes available for sale in many markets  as speculators attempt to sell the homes they previously purchased or cancel contracts for homes under construction  and as those builders that as part of their business strategy were building homes in anticipation of capturing additional sales in a demand driven market  attempt to reduce their inventories by lowering prices and adding incentives 
in addition  based on the high cancellation rates reported by us and by other builders  non speculative buyer cancellations are also adding to the supply of homes in the marketplace 
the decline in the average sales price of new sales contracts signed was due primarily to a shift in the number of contracts signed to less expensive areas and or smaller homes and the effect of increased sales incentives in fiscal as compared to fiscal at october   our backlog of homes under contract accounted for under the completed contract method of accounting was billion  homes  lower than the billion  homes in backlog at october  the decrease in backlog at october  compared to the backlog at october  is primarily attributable to a lower backlog at october  as compared to the backlog at october   and the decrease in the value and number of contracts signed in fiscal as compared to fiscal  offset in part by the lower number of deliveries in fiscal as compared to fiscal home costs as a percentage of revenue were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in the fiscal percentage was primarily the result of the higher amount of inventory impairment charges recognized  increased sales incentives given to home buyers on the homes delivered and higher overhead costs per home delivered 
in fiscal and  we recognized inventory impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased by approximately due to the increased sales incentives and by due to higher overhead costs per home 
revenues and costs percentage of completion we are developing several projects for which we are recognizing revenues and costs using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenues and costs of individual projects are recognized on the individual project s aggregate value of units for which home buyers have signed binding agreements of sale and are based on the percentage of total estimated construction costs that have been incurred 
total estimated revenues and construction costs are reviewed periodically  and any change is applied to current and future periods 
in fiscal and  we recognized million and million of revenues  respectively  and million and million of costs  respectively  on these projects 
in fiscal  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues recognized of was slightly higher than the fiscal percentage of 
the increase was due primarily to cost increases and a change in the mix of revenues recognized in fiscal to more costly projects 
in fiscal  we delivered million homes in projects for which we are using the percentage of completion method of accounting 

table of contents at october   our backlog of homes in communities that we account for using the percentage of completion method of accounting was million net of million of revenue recognized compared to million at october  net of million of revenue recognized 
the decline in the backlog at october  is primarily the result of the recognition of revenues and a decline in contracts signed 
we expect that this decline will continue as we recognize revenues in the two remaining projects where we use percentage of completion accounting  and as we sell out of these projects without replacing them with new ones that qualify under the accounting rules for the application of the percentage of completion accounting method 
see new accounting pronouncements in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
revenues and costs land sales we are developing several communities in which we expect to sell a portion of the land to other builders or entities 
the amount and profitability of land sales will vary from year to year depending upon the sale and delivery of the specific land parcels 
in fiscal and  land sales revenues were million and million  respectively  and the cost of land sales revenues was approximately and of land sales revenues  respectively 
interest expense in our communities accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting  we determine interest expense on a specific lot by lot basis  and for land sales we determine interest expense on a parcel by parcel basis 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense varies depending on many factors  including the period of time that we owned the land  the length of time that the homes delivered during the period were under construction  and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by us in proportion to the amount of our inventory during those periods 
for projects using the percentage of completion method of accounting  interest expense is determined based on the total estimated interest for the project and the percentage of total estimated construction costs that have been incurred to date 
any change in the estimated interest expense for the project is applied to current and future periods 
interest expense as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a spending decreased by million  or in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the reduction in spending was due primarily to cost reductions  offset in part by the expenses resulting from the increased number of communities from which we were operating during fiscal as compared to fiscal at october   we had selling communities  a increase over the selling communities we had at october  goodwill impairment during the three month period ended january   due to the continued decline of the detroit market  we re evaluated the carrying value of goodwill associated with a acquisition 
we estimated the fair value of our assets in this market  including goodwill 
fair value was determined based on the discounted future cash flow expected to be generated in this market 
based upon this evaluation and our expectation that this market would not recover for a number of years  we determined that the related goodwill was impaired 
we recognized a million impairment charge in the three month period ended january  after recognizing this charge  we did not have any goodwill remaining from this acquisition 
loss earnings from unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in the trust and trust ii 
we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings from these entities 
many of our joint ventures are land development projects or high rise mid rise construction projects and do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property 
once development is complete  the joint ventures will generally  over a relatively short period of time  generate revenues and earnings until all the assets of the entities are sold 
because there is not a steady flow of 
table of contents revenues and earnings from these entities  the earnings recognized from these entities will vary significantly from period to period 
in fiscal  we recognized million of losses from unconsolidated entities as compared to million of earnings in fiscal the fiscal loss was attributable to million of impairment charges on two of our investments in unconsolidated entities in our quarter ended october  interest and other income in fiscal  we recognized million of interest and other income as compared to million in fiscal the million increase in fiscal was primarily the result of the recognition into income of million of retained customer deposits in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  a million gain realized from the sale of our security business  a million gain realized from the sale of our cable tv and broadband internet business  and an million increase in interest income in fiscal as compared to income before income taxes income before taxes in fiscal was million  a decrease of from the billion earned in fiscal income taxes income taxes were provided at an effective rate of in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to lower pretax income reported in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the greater impact of individual components of the provision for income taxes on the overall rate in fiscal as compared to the fiscal rate 
the effective state income tax rate for fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the increase in the state tax rate was the result of the allocation of our income and losses to the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and the tax rates in those jurisdictions 
in addition  in fiscal  we reported higher tax free income  an increase in our estimated interest provided on anticipated tax assessments and a lower amount of expiring state tax provisions as compared to fiscal we also recognized million and million of manufacturing and other tax credits in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as a percentage of income before taxes  the credits were significantly higher then the fiscal percentage 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional information regarding the change in the income tax rates and the impact on the financial statements 
geographic segments we operate in four geographic segments around the united states the north  consisting of connecticut  illinois  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  new jersey  new york  ohio and rhode island  the mid atlantic  consisting of delaware  maryland  pennsylvania  virginia and west virginia  the south  consisting of florida  georgia  north carolina  south carolina  and texas  and the west  consisting of arizona  california  colorado and nevada 
we stopped selling homes in ohio in fiscal and delivered our last home in that state in fiscal the operations in ohio were immaterial to the north segment 
we acquired and opened for sale our first communities in georgia in fiscal 
table of contents the following table summarizes by geographic segments total revenues and income loss before income taxes for each of the years ended october  and amounts in millions income loss before revenues income taxes units units north a mid atlantic b south c west corporate and other total a includes percentage of completion revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and land sales revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
b includes land sales revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
c includes percentage of completion revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and land sales revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
north revenues in fiscal were lower than those for fiscal by million  or 
the decrease in revenues was attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered and a reduction in percentage of completion revenues of million  offset  in part  by a increase in the average price of the homes delivered 
approximately of the decrease in revenues related to the new jersey suburban markets  where the number of homes delivered decreased and the average price of the homes delivered decreased 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the lower backlog of homes at october  as compared to october   which was the result of a decrease in the number of new contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal  and the increased cancellation rates by home buyers in fiscal as compared to the rates in fiscal the value of new contracts signed in fiscal was billion  a decline from the billion of contracts signed in fiscal the number of net new contracts signed and the average value of each contract decreased and  respectively 
the decline in new contracts signed in fiscal was primarily due to a slowdown in the housing market  predominantly in illinois  michigan and the suburban new jersey markets 
however  in new york and the urban markets of northern new jersey  net new signed contracts increased by million for the year ended october   as compared to the same period in the contract cancellation rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
income before income taxes in fiscal was million  a decrease of million from the million reported for fiscal this decrease was due to less profit realized on the lower revenues in fiscal  higher costs of revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and a million decrease in income realized from unconsolidated entities in fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenues before interest as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal versus in fiscal the increase in the fiscal percentage was primarily the result of the higher inventory impairment charges recognized  increased sales incentives given to home buyers on the homes delivered and higher land and direct costs as a percentage of the revenues from homes delivered 
in fiscal and  we recognized inventory impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  the higher land and direct costs increased cost of revenues approximately and sales incentives increased cost of revenues approximately 
mid atlantic revenues in fiscal were lower than those for fiscal by million  or 
the decrease in revenues was attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered primarily in virginia  and a 
table of contents decrease in the average sales price of the homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered was primarily due to the lower backlog of homes at october  as compared to october  the decrease in the backlog of homes was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of net new contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal  due to weak demand and a significantly higher number of contract cancellations in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in the average price of the homes delivered in the fiscal year as compared to fiscal was primarily related to a change in the mix of communities delivering homes in maryland to a lower price point product 
the value of net new contracts signed during the year ended october  of million decreased from the net new contracts signed of billion in the comparable period of fiscal the decline was due primarily to a decrease in the number of net new contracts signed and a decrease in the average value of each contract 
the decline in the number of net new contracts signed was due primarily to continued weak demand and an increase in contract cancellation rates 
the contract cancellation rates for the years ended october  and were and  respectively 
income before income taxes in fiscal was million  a decrease of million from the million reported for fiscal this decrease was attributable to lower revenues and higher cost of revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal for the years ended october  and  cost of revenues before interest as a percentage of revenues was and  respectively 
the increase in the fiscal percentage was primarily the result of the higher amount of inventory impairment charges recognized  increased sales incentives given to home buyers on the homes delivered and higher land costs as a percentage of the revenues from homes delivered 
we recognized inventory impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the higher sales incentives and land costs increased cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues approximately and  respectively 
south revenues in fiscal were lower than those of fiscal by million  or 
the decrease in revenues was attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered and a reduction in percentage of completion revenues of million  partially offset by a increase in the average selling price of the homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to our florida operations  where we had a lower number of homes in backlog at october  as compared to october  and increased cancellations rates by homebuyers in versus for the year ended october   the value of net new contracts signed was million compared to million in the comparable period of fiscal  a decrease of 
the decline was due to decreases in the number of net new contracts signed and the average value of each contract of and  respectively 
the decrease in the number of net new contracts signed was attributable to weak market conditions  especially in florida  and a significantly higher number of contract cancellations 
in fiscal years and  the cancellation rate in florida was and  respectively 
for the entire region  the cancellation rate was and for the years ended october  and  respectively 
the decrease in the average sales price was primarily due to a shift in the number of contracts to areas with lower priced homes in fiscal compared to fiscal we reported a loss before income taxes for the year ended october  of million  as compared to income before taxes of million for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues in the fiscal as compared to fiscal  partially offset by higher retained customer deposits on contract cancellations 
cost of revenues before interest as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in the fiscal percentage was primarily due to the higher amount of inventory impairment charges recognized  increased sales incentives given to home buyers on the homes delivered  offset  in part  by lower overhead costs

the decrease in revenues was attributable to declines in the number of homes delivered and in the average price of homes delivered of and  respectively 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered was primarily attributable to the lower number of homes in backlog at october  as compared to october   a significantly higher number of contract cancellations in fiscal than in fiscal and higher sales incentives in fiscal versus the value of net new contracts signed in the year ended october  of million decreased from the net new contracts signed of billion in fiscal the decline was primarily due to a decrease in the number of net new contracts signed in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which was attributable to weak demand and higher than normal contract cancellations 
the cancellation rate for the year ended october  was as compared to for the year ended october  for fiscal  we reported a loss before income taxes of million  compared to income before income taxes of million for fiscal this decrease was attributable to lower revenues and higher cost of revenues in as compared to and a million impairment charge in fiscal related to two unconsolidated entities in which we have investments

the increase in the fiscal percentage was primarily the result of the higher amount of inventory impairment charges recognized and increased sales incentives given to home buyers on the homes delivered 
we recognized inventory impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the higher sales incentives increased cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue approximately 
other other loss before income taxes for fiscal was million  a decrease of million from the million loss before income taxes reported for fiscal this decline was primarily the result of lower general and administrative costs attributable to lower compensation expenses  a million gain realized from the sale of our security business  a million gain realized from the sale of our cable tv and broadband internet business  and higher interest income 
fiscal compared to fiscal home sales revenues and costs completed contract home sales revenues for fiscal were higher than those for fiscal by approximately million  or 
the increase in revenues was attributable to a increase in the average price of the homes delivered offset in part by a decrease in the number of homes delivered 
the increase in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal was the result of higher selling prices of homes in backlog at october  compared to the homes in backlog at october  and the delivery in fiscal of fewer attached homes and age qualified homes  which had lower average selling prices  as compared to the decrease in the number of homes delivered was primarily due to the slowdown in new contracts signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal and a significant number of cancellations of contracts for homes scheduled to be delivered during fiscal from our backlog at october  the value of new sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  a decrease compared to the value of contracts signed in fiscal of billion  homes 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of new contracts signed despite having a significantly higher number of communities open for sale in fiscal compared to fiscal at october  and  we had and selling communities  respectively 
the decrease in the value of new sales contracts signed was partly offset by a increase in the average value of each contract 
we believe this slowdown was attributable to a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes and an oversupply of homes available for sale 
we attribute the reduction in demand to concerns on the part of prospective home buyers about the direction of home prices  due in part to many home builders advertising price reductions and increased sales incentives  and concerns by the prospective home 
table of contents buyer about being able to sell their existing homes 
in addition  we believe speculators and investors are no longer helping to fuel demand 
we try to avoid selling homes to speculators  and we generally do not build detached homes without having a signed agreement of sale 
nonetheless  we have been impacted by an overall increase in the supply of homes available for sale in many markets as speculators attempt to sell the homes they previously purchased or cancel contracts for homes under construction  and as builders  who  as part of their business strategy  were building homes in anticipation of capturing additional sales in a demand driven market attempt to reduce their inventories by lowering prices and adding incentives 
in addition  based on the high cancellation rates reported by us and by other builders  non speculative buyer cancellations are also adding to the supply of homes in the marketplace 
at october   our backlog of traditional homes under contract was billion  homes  lower than the billion  homes backlog at october  the decrease in backlog at october  compared to the backlog at october  was primarily attributable to the decrease in the value of new contracts signed in fiscal as compared to fiscal and to the million more of deliveries in fiscal as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by a higher backlog at october  as compared to the backlog at october  cost of revenues before interest expense as a percentage of home sales revenue was higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher inventory write offs  the cost of land and construction increasing faster than selling prices  higher sales incentives given on the homes delivered in fiscal as compared to those delivered in fiscal and higher overhead costs 
we recognized million of write downs and or write offs of costs related to current and future communities in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the fiscal write offs were attributable primarily to the write off of deposits and predevelopment costs attributable to a number of land purchase contracts that we decided not to go forward with primarily in california and florida and the write down of the carrying cost of several active communities primarily in california and michigan 
home sales revenues and costs percentage of completion we are developing several projects for which we are recognizing revenues and costs using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenues and costs of individual projects are recognized on the individual project s aggregate value of units for which home buyers have signed binding agreements of sale and are based on the percentage of total estimated construction costs that have been incurred 
total estimated revenues and construction costs are reviewed periodically and any change is applied to current and future periods 
we began recognizing revenue and costs using percentage of completion accounting on several projects in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized million of revenues and million of costs before interest expense on these projects 
at october   our backlog of homes in communities that we account for using the percentage of completion method of accounting was million net of million of revenue recognized compared to million at october  land sales revenues and costs we are developing several communities in which we expect to sell a portion of the land to other builders or entities 
the amount and profitability of land sales will vary from period to period depending upon the timing of the sale and delivery of the specific land parcels 
land sales revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal cost of land sales revenues before interest expense was approximately million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal interest expense we determine interest expense on a specific lot by lot basis for our traditional homebuilding operations and on a parcel by parcel basis for land sales 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense varies depending on many factors  including the period of time that we owned the land  the length of time that the homes delivered during the period were under construction  and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by us in proportion to the amount of our inventory during those periods 
interest expense for projects using the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition is determined based on the total estimated interest for the project and the percentage 
table of contents of total estimated construction costs that have been incurred to date 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a spending increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increased spending was principally due to the costs associated with the increase in the number of selling communities that we had during fiscal as compared to fiscal and the expensing of stock option awards pursuant to sfas no 
revised  share based payment in fiscal of million  which expense we did not have in fiscal income from operations income from operations decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  income from operations was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal earnings from unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures with unrelated parties and in the trust and trust ii 
we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings from these entities 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities and note  related party transactions for more information regarding our investments in and commitments to these entities 
many of our joint ventures are land development projects or high rise mid rise construction projects and do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property 
once development is complete  the joint ventures will generally  over a relatively short period of time  generate revenues and earnings until all the assets of the entities are sold 
because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities  the earnings recognized from these entities will vary significantly from year to year 
in fiscal  we recognized million of earnings from unconsolidated entities as compared to million in fiscal interest and other income interest and other income was million in fiscal  an increase of million from the million recognized in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher forfeited customer deposits and higher interest income  offset  in part  by lower broker fees and lower income realized from our ancillary businesses 
income before income taxes fiscal income before income taxes was billion  a decrease from the billion realized in fiscal income taxes income taxes were provided at an effective rate of for fiscal compared to for fiscal the difference in rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a manufacturing tax credit that we first became eligible for in fiscal  the reversal of prior year tax provisions in the fiscal period that we no longer need due to the expiration of tax statutes  offset in part by an increase in the blended state income tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal  the recognition of a higher amount of estimated interest expense net of estimated interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal on expected tax assessments and recoveries due to ongoing tax audits and the effect on the fiscal rate due to recomputing our net deferred tax liability to reflect the increase in our fiscal state tax rate

at october   we had selling communities compared to selling communities at october  income before income taxes in fiscal was million  an increase of million from fiscal income before income taxes of million 
this increase was due to the profits realized on the increased revenues in fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs decreasing as a percentage of revenues as the result of efficiencies gained from the increase in the number of homes delivered and lower cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues 
the lower cost of revenues percentage was principally due to selling prices increasing faster than costs of land and construction  offset in part by higher inventory write downs and write offs

the increase in the average sales price of the homes delivered in fiscal was the result of higher selling prices of homes in backlog at october  compared to the homes in backlog at october   and the delivery of fewer lower priced homes 
the value of net new contracts signed in fiscal  approximately billion  decreased from fiscal new contracts signed of approximately billion 
the decline was due primarily to weak demand and higher than normal contract cancellations in fiscal  offset in part by the higher number of selling communities 
income before income taxes in fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal income before income taxes of million 
this decrease was due to the decrease in revenues in fiscal  the higher cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues principally related to the write downs and write offs of communities under development and land owned or controlled for future communities and higher costs related to the inefficiencies related to the slowdown in construction and higher selling  general and administrative costs  partially offset by increased income realized from unconsolidated entities in fiscal compared to fiscal we recognized inventory write downs and write offs of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal 
table of contents capital resources and liquidity funding for our business has been provided principally by cash flow from operating activities  unsecured bank borrowings and the public debt and equity markets 
we have used our cash flow from operating activities  bank borrowings and the proceeds of public debt and equity offerings to acquire additional land for new communities  fund additional expenditures for land development  fund construction costs needed to meet the requirements of our backlog and the increasing number of communities in which we were offering homes for sale  invest in unconsolidated entities  repurchase our stock  and repay debt 
in fiscal  we generated approximately million of cash including million of cash flow from operating activities 
cash flow from operating activities in fiscal was generated primarily from net income  the commencement of deliveries of units accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting and the decrease in home sites owned during the period from  lots at october  to  at october   offset  in part  by our spending for inventory as we continued to improve land that we owned  continued construction spending in existing communities and the opening of additional high density communities and the funding of the cost of the increased number of speculative units that we had in our inventory as a result of contract cancellations 
at october   the aggregate purchase price of land parcels under option and purchase agreements was approximately billion including billion of land to be acquired from joint ventures in which we have invested 
of the billion of land purchase commitments  we had paid or deposited million and had invested in or guaranteed loans on behalf of the aforementioned joint ventures of million 
the purchases of these land parcels are scheduled over the next several years 
in general  cash flow from operating activities assumes that  as each home is delivered  we will purchase a home site to replace it 
because we own several years supply of home sites  we do not need to buy home sites immediately to replace the ones delivered 
in addition  we generally do not begin construction of our single family detached homes until we have a signed contract with the home buyer  although in fiscal and  due to an extremely high cancellation rate of customer contracts and the increase in the number of attached home communities that we were operating from  the number of speculative homes in our inventory increased significantly 
in fiscal  the value of net new contracts signed decreased versus fiscal in fiscal  the value of net new contracts signed with home buyers decreased by from fiscal should our business continue to decline significantly  we believe that our inventory levels would continue to decrease  as we complete and deliver the homes under construction but do not commence construction of as many new homes  complete the improvements on the land we already own and sell and deliver the speculative homes that are currently in inventory  resulting in an increase in our cash flow from operations 
in addition  we might continue to delay or curtail our acquisition of additional land  as we did in fiscal and the second half of fiscal  which would further reduce our inventory levels and cash needs 
we decreased our home sites owned and controlled at october  by approximately from the october  level and by from the april  level  the high point of lots owned and controlled  in response to the deterioration of the housing market 
during the past several years  we have had a significant amount of cash invested in either short term cash equivalents or short term interest bearing marketable securities 
in addition  we have made a number of investments in unconsolidated entities related to the acquisition and development of land for future home sites or in entities that are constructing or converting apartment buildings into luxury condominiums 
our investment activities related to marketable securities and investments in and distributions of investments from unconsolidated entities are contained in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the section cash flow from investing activities 
we have a billion credit facility consisting of a billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility collectively  the credit facility with banks  which extends to march at october   interest was payable on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at subject to adjustment based upon our corporate debt rating and leverage ratios above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
at october   we had no outstanding borrowings against the revolving credit facility but had letters of credit of approximately million outstanding under it 
under the term loan facility  interest is payable at subject to adjustment based upon our corporate debt rating and 
table of contents leverage ratios above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
at october   interest was payable on the term loan at 
we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources and our existing sources of credit 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our estimated contractual payment obligations at october  amounts in millions thereafter total senior and senior subordinated notes a loans payable a mortgage company warehouse loan a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b retirement plans c other a amounts include estimated annual interest payments until maturity of the debt 
of the amounts indicated  billion of the senior and senior subordinated notes  million of loans payable  and million of the mortgage company warehouse loan were recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
b amounts represent our expected acquisition of land under options or purchase agreements and the estimated remaining amount of the contractual obligation for land development agreements secured by letters of credit and surety bonds 
c amounts represent our obligations under our k  deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plans 
of the total amount indicated  million has been recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land  land development  construction and overhead  as well as in increased sales prices 
we generally contract for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect our profits 
because the sales price of each of our homes is fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to acquire a home  and because we generally contract to sell our detached homes before we begin construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
we generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting our prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally 
table of contents do not affect the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our earnings and cash flow 
we do not have the obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until we are required to refinance such debt 
at october   our debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates  and estimated fair value were as follows amounts in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt a b weighted weighted average average fiscal year of maturity amount interest rate amount interest rate thereafter discount total fair value at october  a we have a billion credit facility consisting of a billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility collectively  the credit facility with banks  which extends to march  at october   interest was payable on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at subject to adjustment based upon our corporate debt rating and leverage ratios above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
at october   we had no outstanding borrowings against the revolving credit facility  but had letters of credit of approximately million outstanding under it 
under the term loan facility  interest is payable at subject to adjustment based upon our corporate debt rating and leverage ratios above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
at october   interest was payable on the million term loan at 
b at october   our mortgage subsidiary had a million line of credit with four banks to fund mortgage originations 
the line is due within days of demand by the banks and bears interest at the banks overnight rate plus an agreed upon margin 
at october   the subsidiary had million outstanding under the line at an average interest rate of 
borrowings under this line are included in the fiscal maturities 
in november  the bank line was reduced to million and three banks 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at october   and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by us by approximately million per year
