overview nature of the business 
learning tree international is a leading worldwide vendor independent provider of training and education to managers and information technology professionals working in business and government organizations 
since our founding in  we have provided high quality training to million managers and it professionals 
in fiscal year we provided training to  course participants from more than  organizations worldwide  including large national and multinational companies  government organizations  and small and medium size companies 
we offer a broad proprietary library of intensive instructor led courses from one to five days in length  comprising different course titles representing over  hours of training as of september  learning tree courses provide both breadth and depth of education across a wide range of technical and management disciplines  including operating systems  databases  computer networks  computer and network security  web development  programming languages  software engineering  open source applications  project management  business skills  and leadership and professional development 
we use a well defined  systematic approach in developing and updating the learning tree course library to provide training that is immediately relevant to course participants working in a broad range of applications and industries 
after assessing market need  courses are translated into french  swedish and japanese 
our proprietary development process also allows us to customize our courses for delivery at customer sites 
we design our own vendor independent it courses to provide participants an unbiased perspective of software and hardware products with the ability to compare and integrate multiple platforms and technologies from various vendors in a single course 
while addressing core concepts and theory  all our technical and management courses focus primarily on providing skills  tools  and techniques which participants can apply immediately upon returning to their jobs 
to accomplish this objective  our proprietary realityplus courses utilize extensive multi media simulations to teach practical management techniques 
this innovative methodology provides an environment in which realityplus course participants learn entirely by doing 
throughout these courses  they gain extensive experience applying new management skills in life like challenging situations  within the confines of the classroom and under the guidance of an expert instructor 
as a result  realityplus course participants achieve greater mastery of effective management techniques as well as the confidence needed to apply them  and thus return to their jobs both ready and willing to immediately apply their expanded skills in their workplaces 
learning tree courses are highly interactive 
based on their sophistication and quality  all learning tree courses are recommended for one or two semester hours of college credit by the american council on education 
we are a trusted cpe provider of the isc in addition  we are on the national association of state boards of accountancy national registry of cpe sponsors and are a registered education provider of the pmi 
we had instructors as of september   each of whom was a practicing professional combining expert knowledge with extensive practical experience 
on average  each expert instructor teaches approximately course events per year for us on an as needed basis 
when they are not teaching  learning tree instructors are using and honing their management and it skills as either full time employees for other companies or as independent consultants 

table of contents we offer our proprietary courses through wholly owned local subsidiaries in the united states  the united kingdom  france  canada  sweden and japan  and generate over half of our revenues internationally 
each operating subsidiary is staffed by local personnel responsible for the sale and delivery of our courses in that country 
our infrastructure and logistical capabilities allow us to coordinate  plan and deliver our courses at learning tree education centers  external hotel and conference facilities and customer sites worldwide 
during fiscal year  we presented courses in countries 
we have structured our business so that the majority of our course delivery costs are variable and depend primarily upon the number of course events conducted 
we schedule our course events throughout the year based on our assessment of demand 
since learning tree instructors typically work full time or as consultants for other business and industry employers  or in the case of management instructors as industry consultants and facilitators  they teach our course events as needed and thus  our instructor related costs are largely variable 
however  expenses associated with our own education centers and course equipment are largely fixed 
we adjust our expenditures for sales and marketing depending on our strategic objectives  which generally include an assessment of our expectations for influencing future customer demand  market conditions and other factors 
however  if our expectations regarding the results of our marketing efforts prove to be wrong  any significant revenue shortfall would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
recent trends 
as we have for more than years  we continue to focus on enhancing quality levels through our core strengths our expert instructors  proprietary and innovative content library and pedagogical technique  state of the art classrooms and worldwide course delivery systems 
we believe that quality and customer satisfaction remain the underlying driving force for our long term success 
in fiscal year  course participants continued to give our instructors and courses their highest quality ratings in our history 
learning tree customers have continued to respond positively to our increase in the breadth and depth of our management course offerings 
at september   we offered titles in our management curriculum representing of our entire course library  compared to titles  which represented of the learning tree course library at the same point in fiscal year we intend to meet the demand for management education by continuing to develop additional management course titles  and by increasing the sales and marketing for our management course programs 
in response to customer demand and the expressed need for management education that is more relevant to real world business challenges  in fiscal year we introduced our reality plus line of management courses 
we believe that these courses represent a significant advancement in providing state of the art management education 
our business continues to be influenced by world events  the economy  and corporate spending trends for it  among other factors 
we use a strong  focused  integrated marketing and sales strategy that clearly and visibly helps our customers identify specific applications of training services to improve their business performance 
accordingly  we continue to assess alternative approaches to sales and marketing with the objective of improving our performance under current market conditions 
however  there is no guarantee that these approaches will be successful 
see item a 
we follow a or week fiscal year 
our year end and quarter end dates are on the friday nearest the end of the calendar quarter 
accordingly  our fiscal year ended on september   fiscal year ended on september   and fiscal year ended on september  each of those years comprised weeks 
fiscal year will be a week year  and will end on october  
table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year ended september  september  september  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses course development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss fiscal year compared with fiscal year in fiscal year  our revenues were million compared to million in fiscal year income from operations was million in fiscal year compared to a loss from operations of million in fiscal year net income for fiscal year was million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal year revenues 
our fiscal year revenues increased by compared to fiscal year this increase was the result of a increase in revenue per participant which was partially offset by a decrease in the number of participants for our courses 
the increase in revenue per participant was primarily the result of a positive effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  price increases  and lower attendance under the discounted passport programs and higher attendance under the higher priced regular and voucher programs 
during fiscal year  we trained  course participants  a decrease from the  participants that were trained during the prior fiscal year 
for fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training versus the  attendee days in fiscal year in our management courses during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  a increase over the  attendee days in the corresponding period during fiscal year in our technology courses during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of it training  a decrease from the  attendee days during fiscal year we continue to believe in the inherent strength of the it training market  and we intend to continue to develop and deliver courses that help learning tree customers improve their productivity by making the most of their investment in technology products  services and people 
as a result  we continue to invest in developing new it course titles  in addition to increasing the number of course titles in our management curriculum 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues primarily includes the costs of course instructors and their travel expenses  course materials and equipment  freight  classroom facilities and refreshments 
during fiscal year  we presented  events  compared to  events in fiscal year our cost of revenues for fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year our cost of revenues as a percentage of our revenues was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year changes in exchange rates do not materially affect our gross profit percentages since exchange rates have essentially the same impact on both revenues and cost of revenues in any time period 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year compared to the prior year is due to an increase in average revenue per event of offset slightly by an increase of in average cost per event 
the increase in our average revenue per event results principally from the increase in average revenue per participant discussed above  a increase in average participants per event  and a slight decrease in the number of events held at customer locations  which typically have a lower average revenue per event than events held in our own education centers 
the increase in average cost per event results from the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates  mostly offset by reductions in education center costs and reduced instructor expenses  compared to the prior year 

table of contents course development expenses 
we maintain a disciplined process to develop new courses and update our existing courses 
all costs incurred in that process  principally for internal product development staff and for subject matter experts  are expensed when incurred and are included in course development expenses 
during fiscal year  course development expenses were of revenues compared to during the prior year 
in fiscal year  we decreased our overall spending on course development by to million compared with million in fiscal year beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year  we had significantly increased our spending on course development primarily in conjunction with the development and updating of our management course curriculum 
during fiscal year we converted management course titles to the realityplus methodology compared to management courses converted in fiscal year we introduced new management course titles in fiscal year compared with new management course titles introduced in fiscal year during fiscal year we introduced it courses  comparable with at the end of fiscal year  the learning tree library of instructor led courses numbered titles  comprising over  hours of training compared with titles at the end of fiscal year the increase in the number of titles in fiscal year reflects the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
in general  titles are retired when the profits they generate no longer justify the ongoing cost of marketing them and maintaining their content 
thus  we may or may not develop more titles than we retire in any period 
at september   we had management titles in the learning tree course library  compared with management titles at the same point a year earlier 
our library of it titles numbered as of september  compared to titles at the end of fiscal year we plan to increase our investment in course development during fiscal  which should result in an increased rate of new course introductions toward the end of that year 
additionally  we continue to be excited about extending our proprietary realityplus instructional technology within our management curriculum 
we have also initiated a research program to explore adapting our existing courses to a blended learning format that would combine classroom instruction and on line learning 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include the cost of designing  producing and distributing direct mail and media advertisements  marketing e mails and our website  compensation and travel related costs for sales and marketing personnel  and the cost of information systems to support these activities 
our sales and marketing expense  and in particular our expenditure on course catalogs  is one of our largest expenditures 
we have adjusted the market segments to which we mail our catalogs  and are presently evaluating a number of additional ways to increase the efficiency of our marketing expenditures by spending less without materially affecting the response to that marketing 
at the same time  we have been increasing our sales staff in certain operating units 
based on our experience to date  in those operating units  we intend to continue expanding our sales staffing in order to implement this strategy in all operating units 
our sales and marketing expenses were and of revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease due to a reduction in the quantity of catalogs mailed  offset by a million increase in sales compensation expense including incentive compensation  a million increase in use taxes due on catalogs and the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased by million over the prior fiscal year  from million to million and represented of revenues compared to in fiscal year the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  a million increase in salary expense  a million increase in incentive compensation expense  a one time increase of million in personnel expense  an expense of million associated with subleasing and facilities arrangements in our united kingdom education center  offset by a decrease of million in professional service fees 
for fiscal year  total expenses associated with stock option compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
revised share based payment sfas r was million  approximately the same as in fiscal year in fiscal year  million of sfas r expense was recorded to general and administrative expense  also about the same as in fiscal year the remainder of our sfas r expense is apportioned among other expense categories  based on where we record the compensation costs for the individuals with whom the stock option compensation expense is associated 

table of contents other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is primarily comprised of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
during fiscal year  other income  net totaled million  compared to million in fiscal year the increase principally relates to higher interest rates earned on higher invested balances 
income taxes 
in fiscal year  our income tax provision was million compared to million in fiscal year our effective rate for fiscal year is compared to in fiscal year the low effective rate for fiscal year is attributable to the reversal of the valuation allowance related to our us deferred tax assets which reduced our tax provision by million and million from favorable adjustments from an audit of our canadian subsidiary 
the effective tax rate in fiscal year is unusually high because of the provision related to the canadian transfer pricing tax examination  a worldwide transfer pricing contingency reserve  and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for our us and french operating subsidiaries 
during fiscal year  our canadian subsidiary underwent a transfer pricing tax examination by the canada revenue agency cra with respect to fiscal years and in september  cra proposed a preliminary assessment in the amount of million for additional taxes and interest 
in december  we accepted the proposed assessment and included this amount in our tax provision for fiscal year in july  we requested that cra adjust our canadian income taxes for fiscal years    and in a manner consistent with the adjustments cra required for tax years and in addition  we filed our canadian income tax return for tax year consistent with that methodology 
the impact of adjusting the four additional years and filing the return consistently with the adjusted years  when netted against the assessments for and  resulted in a net benefit to us of approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal year  we established valuation allowances for portions of the deferred tax assets of our us entities and one entity in a foreign jurisdiction 
as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of these deferred tax assets are recoverable  based on the improved financial performance of the us entities during fiscal year and our expectations for the future 
accordingly  we released the valuation allowance for the assets of the us entities  except for the assets related to foreign tax credit carryovers and the deferred tax assets for certain state jurisdictions 
this release of the valuation allowance resulted in a net benefit of approximately million recognized in the fiscal year tax provision 
our total valuation allowance decreased by million  with the additional decrease attributable to fiscal year results from operations 
as of september   we continued to maintain valuation allowances in the us related to the foreign tax credit carryovers and certain state deferred tax assets  and we continued to maintain a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in a foreign jurisdiction 
we intend to maintain these valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal 
profits or losses incurred in the us and in the foreign jurisdiction will affect the ongoing amount of the valuation allowances 
we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes of international subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of september   because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely 
the undistributed earnings were approximately million as of september  if these earnings were distributed  we would incur approximately million of foreign withholding taxes 
because of the availability of us foreign tax credits  it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested 
geographic data 
we have learning tree education centers in six countries and have historically derived approximately half of our revenues from outside the united states 
the united states operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year revenues from our european operations were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year canadian operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year and our asian operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on segment reporting 

table of contents although our consolidated financial statements are stated in us dollars  all of our subsidiaries other than in the us have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
gains and losses arising from the translation of the balance sheets of our subsidiaries from the functional currencies to us dollars are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity 
fluctuations in exchange rates may also have an effect on our results of operations 
since both revenues and expenses are generally denominated in the subsidiary s local currency  changes in exchange rates that have an adverse effect on our foreign revenues are partially offset by a favorable effect on our foreign expenses  and vice versa 
the impact of future exchange rates on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore we continue to be subject to such risks 
in the future  we may undertake such hedging transactions 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques we implement would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
see item a 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year in fiscal year  our revenues were million compared to million in fiscal year we reported a loss from operations of million in fiscal year compared to a loss from operations of million in the prior year 
net loss for fiscal year was million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal year revenues 
our fiscal year revenues increased by compared to fiscal year this increase was the result of a increase in the number of participants in our courses offset by a decrease in revenue per participant 
the decline in revenue per participant was the result of a negative effect from changes in foreign exchange rates as well as an increase in the percentage of courses being held at customer locations and an increase in the percentage of participants in our management courses 
courses held at customer locations are typically sold at prices that result in lower average revenue per participant than courses held in our own education centers 
the average management course is shorter than the average it course  and thus generally has lower average revenue per participant 
during fiscal year  we trained  course participants  a increase from the  participants that were trained during the prior fiscal year 
for fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  versus the  attendee days in fiscal year for management courses during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  a increase over the  attendee days in the corresponding period in fiscal year for technology courses for fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of it training  a decrease from the  attendee days in fiscal year cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues primarily includes the costs of course instructors and their travel expenses  course materials and equipment  freight  classroom facilities and refreshments 
during fiscal year  we presented  events compared to  events conducted during fiscal year our cost of revenues for fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year our cost of revenues as a percentage of our revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
excluding the effect of exchange rates  the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year reflects a decrease in average cost per event  which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue per event 
the decrease in average cost per event  excluding the effect of exchange rates  primarily reflects a slight increase in the proportion of course events held at customer locations during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year largely offset by one time costs of million associated with our move to our new education center in new york city in august the decrease in our average revenue per event  excluding the effect of exchange rates  resulted principally from an increase in the proportion of events held at customer locations  which typically have a lower average revenue per event than events held in our own education centers  partially offset by the increase in our average revenue per attendee day discussed above 
changes in exchange rates do not materially affect gross profit percentages since exchange rates have essentially the same impact on both revenues and cost of revenues in any time period 
course development expenses 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year  we significantly increased our spending on course development primarily in conjunction with the development and updating of our management 
table of contents course curriculum to incorporate our new realityplus methodology 
during fiscal year  course development expenses were of revenues as compared to during the prior year 
in fiscal year  we increased our overall spending on course development by to million compared with million in fiscal year during fiscal year we converted management course titles to the realityplus methodology 
additionally  we introduced new management course titles in fiscal year compared with new management course titles introduced in fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  the learning tree library of instructor led courses numbered titles  comprising over  hours of training compared with titles at the end of fiscal year the increase in the number of titles in fiscal year reflects the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
at september   we had management titles in the learning tree course library  compared with management titles at the same point a year earlier 
our library of it titles remained unchanged  numbering titles at the end of both fiscal years and sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses were and of revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses remained relatively constant at million and million  respectively during fiscal years and this slight increase was a result of million related to the addition of new sales staff offset by a reduction of million associated with reduced catalog mailings  postage and lower fulfillment costs and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased by million over the prior fiscal year  and represented of revenues in both years 
during fiscal year the increase in our general and administrative expenses compared to fiscal year  was principally due to a million increase in professional service fees  an increase of million for stock compensation expense  partially offset by a reduction of million in costs associated with lease termination costs and impairments of certain assets related to our united kingdom education center in fiscal year as well as an increase of million related to miscellaneous expenses and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
total sfas r expense for fiscal year was million  of which million is recorded as general and administrative expense  as noted above 
the remainder of our sfas r expense is apportioned among other expense categories  based on where we record the compensation costs for the individuals with whom the stock option compensation expense is associated 
we do not expect the distribution of sfas r expense among expense categories to differ significantly from one year to the next 
because we adopted sfas r effective october   the first day of our fiscal year  we did not report stock option compensation expense in fiscal year in fiscal year  we entered into a series of subleases for new subtenants to occupy three and one half floors of vacated space in our united kingdom education facility 
based on the subleases signed at various points in fiscal year  the actual terms and additional expenses of readying the space for lease were revised from the initial assumptions made in fiscal year we recorded a net change of million in our deferred rent facilities and other account to account for the revised assumptions 
no similar liabilities were recorded in fiscal year  although a nominal amount of accretion expense related to the lease termination costs was recorded as an increase in our general and administrative expenses both in fiscal year and fiscal year other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is primarily comprised of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
during fiscal year  other income  net totaled million  compared to million in fiscal year the increase principally relates to higher interest rates earned on invested balances 
income taxes 
in fiscal year our income tax provision increased to million from million in fiscal year the fiscal year income tax provision was increased by million relating to a canadian income tax settlement  million relating to a contingency reserve for worldwide transfer pricing and an additional million relating to a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for our us and french operating subsidiaries 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared to  in fiscal year the effective tax rate in fiscal year was unusually high because of the provision related to the canadian transfer pricing tax audit  the worldwide transfer 
table of contents pricing contingency reserve  and the us and french valuation allowances 
the effective tax rate in fiscal year was extraordinarily high as a result of the impact of permanent differences  which had an extraordinary percentage impact in fiscal year when pre tax income was near breakeven and significantly lower than in fiscal year additionally  the fiscal year effective tax rate was impacted by a million one time charge relating to an unutilized fiscal year tax deduction 
inflation 
inflation and changing prices do not have a significant impact on our net sales  revenues and income from continuing operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to financial accounting standards board statement no

fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin in fiscal year we are currently assessing the potential effect of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year  although early adoption is permitted 
in september  the fasb provided a one year deferral for the implementation of sfas only with regard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
we are currently assessing the potential effect of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year we are currently assessing the potential effect of sfas on our consolidated financial statements  but do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth unaudited quarterly financial data for the eight fiscal quarters ended september  we believe that this information includes all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly information when read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements

the fluctuations may be caused by many factors such as i the frequency of course events  ii the number of weeks during which courses can be conducted in a quarter  iii the timing  timely delivery  frequency and size of and response to our direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns  iv the timing of the introduction of new course titles  v the mix between course events held at customer sites and course events held in our education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins  vi competitive forces within markets we serve  vii our ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  viii currency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations  ix natural disasters  external strikes  acts of war or terrorism and other external factors  and x general economic conditions and industry specific slowdowns 
fluctuations in quarter to quarter results also occur as a result of differences in the timing of our spending on the marketing and development of our courses 
see item a 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million to sales and marketing expense for use taxes due on catalogues as well as million of marketing expense that relates to the third quarter 
also in the fourth quarter of we recorded a reduction in tax expense associated with a transfer pricing examination by the canada revenue agency and we released the deferred tax valuation allowance previously recorded for us entities 
see note liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations  and our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents plus available for sale securities which totaled million as of september  
table of contents cash flows 
during fiscal year  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million from million at september  the increase primarily relates to million from cash provided by operations partially offset by million due to investing activities

cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities our cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million in fiscal year during trade accounts receivable and deferred revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues and the related increase in prepaid revenues 
income tax receivables increased significantly due to the canadian tax examination 
asset retirement obligations declined primarily due to the fulfillment of such obligations in conjunction with subleasing the th and th floors of our united kingdom education center 
other accrued liabilities increased due to accrued royalties and payroll 
cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended september   was million  a decrease of million over the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in capital expenditures of million  a net increase of million relating to purchases of available for sale securities  a decrease of million in lease deposits and proceeds from liquidation of investment in collegis  inc of million 
we did not make any repurchases of shares of our common stock in fiscal year in fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of our common stock on the open market at a cost of million 
liquidity 
at september   our working capital was million  an increase of million from september  we do not have any outstanding indebtedness or open lines of credit 
we anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on our balance of cash and cash equivalents  available for sale securities and cash flows from operations to finance our cash needs 
we believe that these sources will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
capital requirements 
during the year ended september  we made capital expenditures of million  of which leasehold improvements accounted for million and purchases of course and office equipment amounted to million 
we will continue to invest in our infrastructure to accommodate any increased customer demand  to continue improving the quality and effectiveness of our course delivery  and to incorporate significant changes in technology 
we expect that our estimated capital expenditures in fiscal year will be approximately million 
we have a number of operating leases for our administrative offices and education center classroom facilities located worldwide 
these leases expire at various dates over the next years 
in addition to requiring monthly payments for rent  some of the leases contain asset retirement provisions whereby we are required to return the leased facilities back to specified conditions at the expiration of the leases

critical accounting estimates and policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following list of critical accounting estimates and policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting estimates and policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition 
we offer our customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a learning tree training passport 
a learning tree training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of courses over a one to two year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each attendance in a course is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken  the average list price of all courses taken and the estimated average number of courses passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of each individual training passport  we record the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and that specific training passport s selling price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
the actual training passport attendance rate is reviewed quarterly  and if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for active training passports and for training passports sold thereafter is adjusted prospectively 
we believe it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to most closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of our passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passports 
we believe that the use of recent historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by passport holders 
the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate we utilize 
although we have seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has changed  we monitor such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 
if the estimates are wrong  we would record the difference between the revenues previously recognized for that training passport and the training passport selling price upon expiration of that training passport 
thus  the timing of revenue recognition may be affected by an inaccurate estimation  but the inaccuracy would have no effect on the aggregate revenue recognized over the one to two year life of each training passport 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
we use estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  based on our analysis of various factors  including our historical collection experience  current trends  specific identification of invoices which are considered doubtful and a percentage of our past due accounts receivable 
although our estimates for this reserve have in the past been reasonably accurate  these estimates could differ from actual collection experience and are subject to adjustment 
our trade accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible 
lease termination costs 
we lease education center and administrative office space under various operating lease agreements 
certain of these operating leases include space that is not used and which is currently subleased 
we calculate and record a liability related to those leases based on the difference between the present value of the net aggregate sublease rental income and the present value of the prime lease costs for the subleased space throughout the remaining term of the leases 
periodically  we evaluate the nature and extent of each of the individual provisions and make adjustments as appropriate  as new information becomes available or subsequent developments occur 
in  we entered into a year lease on a building in london to house our united kingdom education center 
this building has space in addition to that required for our current needs  which we attempt to sublet 
when space is vacant from time to time  we must estimate the fair value of the liability for the vacant space based upon the remaining lease costs as defined by our operating lease agreement reduced by estimated future sublease rental income that could be reasonably obtained for the property based upon prevailing real estate market conditions 
the computed long term portion of such liabilities is recorded as deferred facilities rent and other in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with the short term portion being recorded in other accrued liabilities 
amounts are paid under the master lease to the landlord net of subtenant monthly sublease receipts  and applied to our accrued lease liability  reducing the amount of liability recorded with an offset to general and administrative expenses 
asset retirement obligations 
we have adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas which requires us to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated future cost to retire an asset 
for us  most asset retirement obligations aro liabilities are primarily associated with education facilities leasehold improvements which  at the end of a lease  we are obligated to remove in order to restore the facility back to a condition specified in the lease agreement 
at the inception of such a lease  we record the aro as a liability and also record a leasehold improvement asset in an amount equal to the fair value of the liability 
the capitalized leasehold improvement asset is then depreciated on a straight line basis over years or the term of the lease  whichever is shorter 
any difference between the actual costs incurred for the eventual retirement and the estimated liability previously recorded will be recognized as a gain or loss in our statement of operations at the termination of the lease 
the fair value of any such aro liability is estimated in three steps the costs of leasehold restoration are estimated as if they were to be performed at the inception of the lease  the cost is forecast into the future by applying an inflation rate in effect at the time of adoption together with a market risk premium for a contractor s risk for performing the work in the future  and the present value of this future cost is computed by discounting it at our credit worthiness interest rate determined at the inception of the lease 
the aro liability is subsequently increased annually by interest accretion throughout the term of the lease 
in future periods we may also make adjustments to the aro liability as a result of the availability of new information  technology changes  changes in labor costs and other factors 
the estimate of aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
we cannot predict what revisions to these assumptions will be required in future periods 
the aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
these include estimates for expected future cash flows related to contractual obligations  primarily to restore leased space back to open floor layouts as required by the lease agreements  our credit adjusted risk free rate that considers our estimated credit rating as of the date of lease inception  the market risk premium that we determine based on the length of the individual leases  and the relevant inflation factor in each impacted country 
for the more significant aros we obtain third party restoration estimates specific to those leases 
we cannot predict the type of revisions to these assumptions that will be required in future periods due to the availability of additional information  technology changes  the price of labor costs and other factors 

table of contents critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
learning tree course events range from two to five days  with an average duration of approximately four days 
we use a or week fiscal year in order to better align our external financial reporting with the way we operate our business 
under this method  each fiscal quarter ends on the friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter 
since all courses have a duration of five days or less  and all courses begin and end within the same calendar week  under the or week fiscal year method all revenues and related direct costs for each course event are recognized in the week and the fiscal quarter in which the event takes place 
we offer our customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a learning tree training passport 
a learning tree training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of courses over a one to two year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each attendance in a course is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken  the average list price of all courses taken and the estimated average number of courses passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of each individual training passport  we record the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and that specific training passport s selling price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
the actual training passport attendance rate is reviewed quarterly  and if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for active training passports and for training passports sold thereafter is adjusted prospectively 
we believe it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to most closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of our passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passports 
we believe that the use of recent historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by passport holders 
the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate we utilize 
although we have seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has changed  we monitor such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 
if the estimates are wrong  we would record the difference between the revenues previously recognized for that training passport and the training passport selling price upon expiration of that training passport 
thus  the timing of revenue recognition may be affected by an inaccurate estimation  but the inaccuracy would have no effect on the aggregate revenue recognized over the one to two year life of each training passport 
in addition to our learning tree training passports  we also offer a multiple course sales discount referred to as learning tree training vouchers 
with learning tree training vouchers  a customer buys the right to send a specified number of attendees to learning tree courses over a six to twelve month period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance 
if a training voucher has unused seats at the time of expiration of the voucher  we record the pro rata selling price of the expired unused seat as revenue 
at times we make a business decision to extend a voucher beyond the normal month expiration date 
to provide additional flexibility to meet our customers training needs  we offer a multiple training day sales discount referred to as learning tree day passes 
with learning tree day passes  a customer buys the right to take up to days of training over a one year period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance day 
if a day pass has unused days at expiration  we record the pro rata value of the unused days as revenue 

table of contents stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r on the first day of our fiscal year and as a result changed our critical accounting policy regarding stock based compensation 
this change had a material effect on our results of operations as described below 
we changed the accounting for our stock option plans from the intrinsic value method used prior to october  to the fair value method as required by sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
our consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility  expected term  risk free interest rates  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we analyzed our historical volatility to estimate the expected volatility consistent with sfas r 
the risk free interest rate assumption is an average of the three and five year us treasury rates at the date of grant  which most closely resembles the four year expected life of our options 
the estimated expected life represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and has been determined based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated pre vesting forfeitures 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
we adopted the alternative transition method detailed in fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  which is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
long lived assets 
we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets  such as equipment  property and leasehold improvements  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in making such evaluations  we compare the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the total of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the long lived assets in order to calculate the impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
we make significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  such as estimating cash flows  remaining useful lives  discount rates and growth rates 
the resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time  which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuation of long lived assets 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the basis reported in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations 

table of contents in the normal course of business  we are subject to audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and these authorities may challenge the amount of taxes due 
while we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  we evaluate exposures associated with various tax filing positions and we record reserves for uncertain tax positions 
we believe these reserves are adequate 
our effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if we were to determine the reserves are not required  or if we were to be required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
outlook if foreign exchange rates as of november  remain constant for the remainder of our first quarter of fiscal year  we expect an effect of approximately on our revenues and costs compared with the first quarter of fiscal year we currently anticipate that our revenues for our first quarter of fiscal year will be approximately to million  compared to million in the first quarter of fiscal year we expect that the gross profit as a percentage of revenues for our first quarter of fiscal year will be between and compared to in our first quarter of fiscal year we also expect that our future gross profit percentages will continue to reflect the normal quarterly patterns which we have experienced in prior years 
we expect overall operating expenses for our first quarter of fiscal year to be between million and million  compared with million in the first quarter of fiscal year we thus expect operating income for our first quarter of fiscal year to be between million and million compared with million in our first quarter of fiscal year our interest income reflects changes in interest rates as well as changes in our cash balance 
we expect our first quarter interest income will be approximately million compared with million in our first quarter of fiscal year we thus expect our pre tax income for our first quarter of fiscal to be between million and million compared with million in our first quarter of fiscal year we estimate that our effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal year will be approximately  compared to an effective tax rate of approximately for the first quarter of fiscal year based on the above  we anticipate net income for the quarter ending december  to be between million and million  or earnings per share between and respectively  compared to net income of million  or per share  in the same quarter of fiscal year fiscal year and beyond 
during fiscal year we concentrated on achieving a sustainable increase in our level of profitability  with a secondary focus on revenue growth 
we are proud of the progress we have made toward both of these goals 
even with the reductions in our expenses  we believe that our infrastructure remains capable of handling a significantly greater volume of business activity without a proportionate increase in operating expense 
with respect to revenue  throughout fiscal we achieved year on year revenue growth in each quarter as a result of favorable exchange rates and increased revenue per attendee 
in our fourth quarter of fiscal year  as discussed above  our increased revenues additionally reflected a increase in the number of attendee days of training compared to the same quarter of fiscal year during the coming year we intend to focus on achieving sustainable attendee growth 
while we are currently projecting an increase in attendees during our first quarter of fiscal compared to the prior year  our enrollment rate in the last two months has been about the same as it was in the same period of the prior year  and this trend will partly influence attendance in our second quarter course events 
at the same time  because of the holiday season  attendance at course events in our second fiscal quarter typically includes more enrollments taken after the start of that quarter than do the other three quarters of the year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have 
interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents and available for sale securities are diversified and consist primarily of investment grade securities of high quality financial institutions and corporations 
the fair value of our portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly affected by either a increase or decrease in the rates of interest due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the exposure to exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries 
subsidiaries with material foreign currency exposure are in canada  the united kingdom  sweden and france 
for our foreign subsidiaries  exchange rates can have an impact on the united states dollar value of their reported earnings as well as on the intercompany transactions with the united states and other subsidiaries 

table of contents our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states dollars  while the operations of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the united states dollar may have a significant impact on our reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated monthly into united states dollars at the weighted average exchange rate 
consequently  as the value of the dollar strengthens or weakens relative to other currencies in our major markets the resulting translated revenues  expenses and operating profits become lower or higher respectively 
a hypothetical appreciation of the canadian dollar  euro and british pound of would result in a million increase to our consolidated fiscal year results 
this was estimated using a appreciation factor to the average monthly exchange rates applied to the net income or loss for each of our subsidiaries in the respective period 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates also can have an impact on the united states dollar amount of our stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate of the balance sheet for the respective reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
the canadian dollar  euro and british pound were stronger relative to other currencies  consequently the accumulated other comprehensive income component of the stockholders equity increased million during fiscal year additionally  we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency gains or losses due to short term intercompany transactions between the united states and its consolidated subsidiaries 
while these intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation  exchange rate changes do affect consolidated earnings 
these balances generated a foreign exchange gain of million in fiscal year to perform a sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of a hypothetical change in the value of foreign currencies  assuming no change in interest rates 
as of september   the result of a uniform change in the values of foreign currency exchange rates against the united states dollar for intercompany exposures with all other variables held constant would be immaterial to our results of operations 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
in the future  we may undertake such transactions  however  any hedging techniques we might implement might not be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
see item a 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in available for sale securities  restricted interest bearing long term investments and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments in investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables since most of our customers are large  well established companies and government agencies 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified both by geography and industry  and no single customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues on an annual or quarterly basis 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for any potential credit losses related to our trade receivables 
we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies and we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
