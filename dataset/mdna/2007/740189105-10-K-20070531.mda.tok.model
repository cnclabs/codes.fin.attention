item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions  except per share data business overview precision castparts corp 
pcc or the company completed another very successful year in fiscal  attaining for the third consecutive year record levels of sales  operating income  net income from continuing operations  and earnings per share 
these results were principally driven by exceptional performance from special metals corporation smc following its acquisition  by continuing strong conditions in pcc s core aerospace and power generation markets  and by the company s never ending focus on cost reduction and operational improvements across all of its businesses 
also  during the year  the company successfully acquired gsc foundries  inc gsc and cherry aerospace cherry  two strategically important tuck in acquisitions for the investment cast products and fastener products segments  respectively  and the company added critical production capacity in its investment casting and forging operations to meet the increasing demand for aerospace products 
on the acquisition front  in may pcc acquired smc  a world leader in the production of high performance nickel based alloys and super alloys 
these alloys are principally used to make forged components that operate under extreme conditions in gas turbines and other critical applications 
while smc currently provides our forging operations with a limited quantity of nickel based alloys for manufacturing aerospace components  it is expected that this internal supply will grow substantially over time  enabling us to manage our overall value stream more cost effectively from raw material to forged components 
in addition  smc supplies nickel based alloys to companies other than pcc that serve both aerospace and non aerospace markets 
these non aerospace markets  which represent approximately of smc s sales  provide diversification and additional growth opportunities for pcc 
smc has performed well beyond our initial projections  making rapid progress in improving yields  increasing production volumes  reducing inventories  and leveraging operational efficiencies 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  pcc completed the acquisitions of gsc and cherry  both of which fit strategically into our current framework of companies by expanding our product portfolio and market position 
gsc will enhance our portfolio of small structural investment casting products  enabling us to produce larger aluminum and smaller steel components than those in our current product line  thereby extending our product reach 
cherry will fill a significant gap in our line of critical aerospace fasteners with its rivets and blind bolts  and will open up potential synergies and economies of scale with our other fastener operations 
also  during the year  pcc increased manufacturing capacity to support higher demand for aerospace products by completing key large scale capital expenditure projects  which included the expansion of the titanium facility at pcc structurals  additional ds furnaces at pcc airfoils  a second isothermal forging press at wyman gordon  and a gfm rotary forging machine at smc 
these projects  which required approximately million of capital spending during fiscal  will provide approximately million of incremental sales capacity in fiscal pcc expects fiscal capital expenditures to approximate fiscal spending levels  with approximately percent of spending allocated to capacity expansion projects 
pcc has positioned itself on new and expanding aerospace and igt platforms  and continues to capitalize on its strong foundation across all of its markets 
this robust market position  coupled with the company s relentless focus on cost reduction and performance improvement  has converged with positive market forces to create an environment for profitable growth 
looking ahead to fiscal and beyond  we believe the company will continue to benefit from increases in oem aircraft build rates  which include new high content wide body commercial aircraft models and new military aircraft  and from continuing high aircraft utilization rates 
the company also expects solid growth in demand for

sales of extruded pipe increased percent year over year  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal sales also include approximately million of higher pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs  compared to million last year 

table of contents operating income for the forged products segment was million  or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal operating income as a percent of sales benefited from increased sales volume of higher margin aircraft turbine components  as well as from the impact of successful cost reduction initiatives 
in addition to continuing improvements from base businesses  smc exceeded initial projections and rapidly accelerated its progress in improving yields  increasing production volumes and reducing inventories  thereby significantly improving operating margins each quarter in its first months of operation under pcc 
as a result of improving margins at smc  coupled with more modest improvements in the base business  the segment reported operating margins of in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter  and in the fourth quarter 
these improvements were partially offset by higher material costs  primarily nickel and titanium  which have increased approximately percent and percent  respectively  on the london metals exchange bloomberg and the ti bulk weldables index metalprices 
com  respectively  compared to fiscal the pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by percentage points for both fiscal and fiscal sales in fiscal within this segment are expected to increase principally due to continuing strength in the commercial aerospace cycle and smc s market share gains in non aerospace markets 
we also expect continued growth in extruded pipe sales and regaining strength in the igt market 
additional production capacity has been provided at wyman gordon and smc to accommodate expected growth in fiscal operating income as a percent of sales for smc is expected to show continued improvement  although trending at a more moderate pace than the first three quarters of ownership

operating margins  as a percent of sales  benefited from cost take outs and improved manufacturing processes  as well as increased higher margin aerospace aftermarket business 
interest and taxes net interest expense in fiscal was million  as compared with million in fiscal the higher interest expense is primarily due to higher borrowing levels in fiscal  partially offset by a lower effective interest rate resulting from lower borrowing costs associated with the company s commercial paper program 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent  compared with percent in fiscal the increase in the fiscal tax rate was driven by the phase out of us export incentives  taxes on incremental domestic earnings that are taxed at a higher rate  and decreased tax holiday benefits in foreign jurisdictions as a percentage of pretax income 
the fiscal effective rate reflects a percentage point million tax benefit from tax audit settlements compared to a percentage point million tax benefit in fiscal liquidity and capital resources total assets of  million at april  represented a  million increase from the  million balance at april  this increase was driven by the addition of smc  gsc and cherry assets totaling  million and by increased inventories and receivables to support expected revenue growth in the base businesses

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to pcc s business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on pcc s business operations are discussed throughout the management s discussion and analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
note that the preparation of this annual report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  the company recognizes revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing aftermarket repair and maintenance and engineering activities  are recognized as services are performed 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue 

table of contents accounts receivable reserve the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where pcc is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount the company reasonably expects will be collected 
in addition  the company records reserves for bad debts based on other quantitative measures  which include the analysis of historical write offs and the age of outstanding receivables 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although the company considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates could have a material effect on the required reserve balances 
valuation of inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of the cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
cost for work in process and metal inventories at a significant number of the company s operations is determined on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age  historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a significant impact on the value of pcc s inventories and reported operating results 
goodwill and acquired intangibles from time to time  the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements 
environmental costs the estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of amounts is established  and no amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable 
adjustments to the company s accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in a given period  but any amounts  and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued  are not reasonably estimable at this time 
total environmental reserves accrued at april  and april  were million and million  respectively 
generally  the increase in environmental reserves over the last year reflects existing liabilities associated with the company s acquisitions  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and is not the result of newly discovered environmental liabilities 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarified the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of 
table of contents the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligations covered by this interpretation include those for which an entity has a large obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
in accordance with fas and fin  pcc will record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
currently  pcc has identified a known asset retirement obligation associated with environmental contamination at one of its manufacturing facilities 
the company  however  has not recognized a liability under fin for this retirement obligation because the fair value of remediation at this site cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time 
the settlement date is unknown because remediation of this site is not required until production ceases  and the company has no current or future plans to cease production 
this asset retirement obligation  when estimable  is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or business 
income taxes provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include  in the current period  the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin establishes a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions 
the provisions of fin are effective for our fiscal beginning april  the company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
