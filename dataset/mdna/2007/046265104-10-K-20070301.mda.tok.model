one to four family mortgage lending our primary lending emphasis is on the origination and purchase of first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties that serve as the primary residence of the owner 
to a much lesser degree  we make loans secured by non owner occupied one to four family properties acquired as an investment by the borrower 
we also originate a limited number of second mortgage loans which are underwritten according to the same standards as first mortgage loans 
at december   billion  or  of our total loan portfolio consisted of one to four family mortgage loans  of which billion  or  were adjustable rate mortgage  or arm  loans 
our arm loan portfolio consists primarily of interest only hybrid and hybrid arm loans 
we do not originate negative amortization or payment option arm loans 
we currently offer interest only hybrid arm loans  generally with thirty year terms  which have an initial fixed rate for three  five or seven years and convert into one year interest only arm loans at the end of the initial fixed rate period 
our interest only arm loans require the borrower to pay interest only during the first ten years of the loan term 
after the tenth anniversary of the loan  principal and interest payments are required to amortize the loan over the remaining loan term 
the market for interest only arm loans has expanded rapidly over the past several years to meet consumer mortgage demand 
our portfolio of one to four family interest only arm loans totaled billion  or of our one to four family mortgage loans  at december  we also offer hybrid arm loans which initially have a fixed rate for three  five  seven or ten years and convert into one year arm loans at the end of the initial fixed rate period 
the three  five and seven year hybrid arm loans have terms of up to forty years and the ten year hybrid arm loans have terms of up to thirty years 
our hybrid arm loans require the borrower to make principal and interest payments during the entire loan term 
within our one to four family mortgage loan portfolio of interest only hybrid arm loans  hybrid arm loans and fixed rate loans  we have reduced documentation loan products 
reduced documentation loans include stated income  full asset  or sifa  loans  stated income  stated asset  or sisa  loans  and super streamline loans 
sifa and sisa loans require a prospective borrower to complete a standard mortgage loan application while the super streamline product requires the completion of an abbreviated application and is  in effect  considered a no documentation loan 
at december  our portfolio of one to four family reduced documentation loans totaled billion  or of our one to four family mortgage loans  and was comprised primarily of sifa loans 
all arm loans we offer have annual and lifetime interest rate ceilings and floors 
arm loans may be offered with an initial interest rate which is less than the fully indexed rate for the loan at the time of origination 
we determine the initial discounted rate in accordance with market and competitive factors 
we underwrite arm loans using the initial rate  which may be a discounted rate 
to recognize the credit risks associated with interest only arm loans  during the second quarter  we began underwriting our interest only arm loans based on a fully amortizing thirty year loan 
additionally  effective in  in accordance with federal banking regulatory requirements  we began underwriting our interest only arm loans at the fully indexed rate 
we use the same underwriting standards for our retail  broker and third party mortgage loan originations 
our policy on owner occupied  one to four family loans is to lend up to of the appraised value of the property securing the loan 
generally  for mortgage loans which have a loan to value ratio of greater than  we require the mortgagor to obtain private mortgage insurance 
in addition  we offer a variety of proprietary products which allow the borrower to obtain financing of up to loan to value without private mortgage insurance  through a combination of a first mortgage loan with an loan to value and a home equity line of credit for the additional 
this type of financing does not comprise a significant portion of our lending activities 
arm loans pose credit risks somewhat greater than the risks posed by fixed rate loans primarily because  as interest rates rise  the underlying payments of the borrower increase when the loan is beyond its initial fixed rate period  increasing the potential for default 
interest only arm loans have an additional potential risk element when the loan payments adjust after the tenth anniversary of the loan to include principal payments resulting in a further increase in the underlying payments 
we continue to prudently manage the greater risk posed by arm and interest only arm loans through the application of sound underwriting practices and strong risk management systems 
our reduced documentation loans also have additional elements of risk since not all of the information provided by the borrower is verified and in the case of the super streamline product  the information provided by the borrower is limited 
however  each of these products requires the receipt of an appraisal of the real estate used as collateral for the mortgage loan and a credit report on the prospective borrower 
the loans are priced according to our internal risk assessment of the loan giving consideration to the loan to value ratio  the potential borrower s credit scores and various other credit criteria 
sifa loans require the verification of a potential borrower s asset information on the loan application  but not the income information provided 
sifa loans comprised approximately of our one to four family loan originations in and had an average loan to value ratio at origination of 
the sisa and super streamline loans were not a significant portion of our originations 
generally  we originate fifteen year and thirty year fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans for sale to various gses or other investors with servicing either retained or released 
the sale of such loans is generally arranged through a master commitment either on a mandatory delivery or best efforts basis 
loans serviced for others totaled billion at december  one to four family loan originations and purchases totaled billion in and billion in one to four family loan originations include originations of loans held for sale totaling million in and million in multi family and commercial real estate lending while we are primarily a one to four family mortgage lender  we also emphasize the origination of multi family and commercial real estate loans 
at december   billion  or  of our total loan portfolio consisted of multi family mortgage loans and billion  or  of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans 
during  we originated million of multi family  commercial real estate and mixed use loans compared to million in mixed use loans are secured by properties which are intended for both residential and business use and are classified as multi family or commercial real estate based on the greater number of residential versus commercial units 
the multi family and commercial real estate loans in our portfolio consist of both fixed rate and adjustable rate loans which were originated at prevailing market rates 
multi family and commercial real estate loans are generally five to fifteen year term balloon loans amortized over fifteen to thirty years 
during  we began originating interest only multi family and commercial real estate loans to qualified borrowers 
multi family and commercial real estate interest only loans differ from one to four family interest only loans in that the interest only period for multi family and commercial real estate loans generally ranges from one to five years 
our portfolio of multi family and commercial real estate interest only loans totaled million  or of our multi family and commercial real estate loans  at december   and was comprised primarily of multi family loans 
our policy generally has been to originate multi family and commercial real estate loans in the new york metropolitan area  which includes new york  new jersey and connecticut  although we also originate loans in various other states  including florida and pennsylvania 
originations in states other than new york  new jersey and connecticut represented of our total originations in we are authorized by our board of directors to further expand the areas in which we originate multi family and commercial real estate loans 
in making such loans  we primarily consider the ability of the net operating income generated by the real estate to support the debt service  the financial resources  income level and managerial expertise of the borrower  the marketability of the property and our lending experience with the borrower 
our current policy is to require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of times for multi family and commercial real estate loans 
additionally  on multi family loans  our current policy is to finance up to of the lesser of the purchase price or appraised value of the property securing the loan on purchases or of the appraised value on refinances 
on commercial real estate loans  our current policy is to finance up to of the lesser of the purchase price or appraised value of the property securing the loan on purchases or of the appraised value on refinances 
the majority of the multi family loans in our portfolio are secured by six to fifty unit apartment buildings and mixed use properties more residential than business units 
as of december   our single largest multi family loan had an outstanding balance of million and was current and secured by a unit apartment complex in staten island  new york 
at december   the average balance of loans in our multi family portfolio was approximately  commercial real estate loans are typically secured by retail stores  office buildings and mixed use properties more business than residential units 
as of december   our single largest commercial real estate loan had an outstanding principal balance of million and was current and secured by a three story office building in darien  connecticut 
at december   the average balance of loans in our commercial real estate portfolio was approximately million 
historically  multi family and commercial real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one to four family loans because they typically have larger balances and may be affected to a greater degree by adverse conditions in the economy 
as such  these loans require more ongoing evaluation and monitoring 
because payments on loans secured by multi family properties and commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them  repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower s control  such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation 
construction loans at december   million  or  of our total loan portfolio consisted of construction loans 
we offer construction loans for all types of residential properties and certain commercial real estate properties 
generally  construction loan terms run between one and two years and are interest only  adjustable rate loans indexed to the prime rate 
we generally offer construction loans up to a maximum of million 
as of december   our average construction loan commitment was approximately million and the average outstanding balance of loans in our construction loan portfolio was approximately million 
construction lending involves additional credit risk to the lender as compared with other types of mortgage lending 
this additional credit risk is attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  predicated on the present value of the property and the anticipated future value of the property upon completion of construction or development 
construction loans are funded monthly  based on the work completed  and are generally monitored by a professional construction engineer and our commercial real estate lending department 
to a lesser extent  qualified bank appraisers and certified home inspectors are utilized to monitor less complex projects 
consumer and other loans at december   million  or  of our total loan portfolio consisted of consumer and other loans which were primarily home equity lines of credit 
our home equity lines of credit are originated on one to four family owner occupied properties 
these lines of credit are generally limited to aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by up to of the appraised value of the property 
such lines of credit are underwritten based on our evaluation of the borrower s ability to repay the debt 
home equity lines of credit are adjustable rate loans which are indexed to the prime rate and generally reset monthly 
we also offer overdraft protection  lines of credit  commercial loans  passbook loans and student loans 
consumer and other loans  with the exception of home equity and commercial lines of credit  are offered primarily on a fixed rate  short term basis 
the underwriting standards we employ for consumer and other loans include a determination of the borrower s payment history on other debts and an assessment of the borrower s ability to make payments on the proposed loan and other indebtedness 
in addition to the creditworthiness of the borrower  the underwriting process also includes a review of the value of the collateral  if any  in relation to the proposed loan amount 
our consumer and other loans tend to have higher interest rates  shorter maturities and are considered to entail a greater risk of default than one to four family mortgage loans 
included in consumer and other loans were million of commercial business loans at december  these loans are underwritten based upon the cash flow and earnings of the borrower and the value of the collateral securing such loans  if any 
loan approval procedures and authority except for individual loans in excess of million or when the overall lending relationship exceeds million unless the board of directors has set a higher limit with respect to a particular borrower  mortgage loan approval authority has been delegated by the board of directors to our underwriters and loan committee  which consists of certain members of executive management and other astoria federal officers 
for loans between million and million  the approval of two non officer directors is also required 
for mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties  upon receipt of a completed application from a prospective borrower  we generally order a credit report  verify income and other information and  if necessary  obtain additional financial or credit related information 
as previously discussed  reduced documentation loans have varied verification and documentation requirements 
for mortgage loans secured by multi family properties and commercial real estate  we obtain financial information concerning the operation of the property 
personal guarantees are generally not obtained with respect to such loans 
an appraisal of the real estate used as collateral for mortgage loans is also obtained as part of the underwriting process 
all appraisals are performed by licensed or certified appraisers  the majority of which are licensed independent third party appraisers 
we have an internal appraisal review process to monitor third party appraisals 
the board of directors annually reviews and approves our appraisal policy

asset quality general one of our key operating objectives has been and continues to be to maintain a high level of asset quality 
our concentration on one to four family mortgage lending and the maintenance of sound credit standards for new loan originations have resulted in our maintaining a low level of non performing assets relative to the size of our loan portfolio 
through a variety of strategies  including  but not limited to  aggressive collection efforts and marketing of non performing loans and foreclosed properties  we have been proactive in addressing problem and non performing assets which  in turn  has helped maintain the strength of our financial condition 
the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower s ability to continue to make required loan payments and  in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so  the value of the collateral securing the loan  if any 
a borrower s ability to pay typically is dependent  in the case of one to four family mortgage loans and consumer loans  primarily on employment and other sources of income  and in the case of multi family and commercial real estate loans  on the cash flow generated by the property  which in turn is impacted by general economic conditions 
other factors  such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets  may also impact a borrower s ability to pay 
collateral values  particularly real estate values  are also impacted by a variety of factors including general economic conditions  demographics  maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays 
non performing assets non performing assets include non accrual loans  mortgage loans delinquent days or more and still accruing interest and real estate owned  or reo 
total non performing assets decreased to million at december   from million at december  non performing loans  the most significant component of non performing assets  decreased million to million at december   from million at december  these decreases were primarily due to a reduction in non performing multi family mortgage loans  partially offset by an increase in non performing one to four family mortgage loans 
at december   non performing multi family mortgage loans totaled million and non performing one to four family mortgage loans totaled million 
during the third quarter  we sold million of non performing loans  primarily multi family and one to four family mortgage loans 
our non performing loans continue to remain at low levels in relation to the size of our loan portfolio 
the ratio of non performing loans to total loans decreased to at december   from at december  our ratio of non performing assets to total assets was at december  and at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non performing loans increased to at december   from at december  for a further discussion of the allowance for loan losses and non performing assets and loans  see item  md a 
we discontinue accruing interest on mortgage loans when such loans become days delinquent as to their interest due  even though in some instances the borrower has only missed two payments 
at december   million of mortgage loans classified as non performing had missed only two payments  compared to million at december  we discontinue accruing interest on consumer and other loans when such loans become days delinquent as to their payment due 
in addition  we reverse all previously accrued and uncollected interest through a charge to interest income 
while loans are in non accrual status  interest due is monitored and income is recognized only to the extent cash is received until a return to accrual status is warranted 
in some circumstances  we continue to accrue interest on mortgage loans delinquent days or more as to their maturity date  but not their interest due 
such loans totaled  at december  and  at december  in general  days prior to a loan s maturity  the borrower is reminded of the maturity date 
where the borrower has continued to make monthly payments to us and where we do not have a reason to believe that any loss will be incurred on the loan  we have treated these loans as current and have continued to accrue interest 
the net carrying value of our reo totaled  at december  and million at december  and consisted primarily of one to four family properties 
reo is carried net of allowances for losses at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs 
classified assets our asset review department reviews and classifies our assets and independently reports the results of its reviews to our board of directors quarterly 
our asset classification committee establishes policy relating to the internal classification of loans and also provides input to the asset review department in its review of our assets 
federal regulations and our policy require the classification of loans and other assets  such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality  as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
an asset classified as special mention has potential weaknesses  which  if uncorrected  may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects or in our credit position at some future date 
an asset classified as substandard is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full satisfaction of the loan amount  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
those assets classified as substandard  doubtful or loss are considered adversely classified 
see the table on page for additional information on our classified assets 
if a loan is classified  an estimated value of the property securing the loan  if any  is determined through an appraisal  where possible 
in instances where we have not taken possession of the property or do not otherwise have access to the premises and therefore cannot obtain a complete appraisal  a real estate broker s opinion as to the value of the property is obtained based primarily on a drive by inspection and a comparison of the property securing the loan with similar properties in the area 
in such cases  an internal cash flow analysis may also be performed 
in circumstances for which we have determined that repayment of the loan will be based solely on the collateral and the unpaid balance of the loan is greater than the estimated fair value of such collateral  a specific valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value less estimated selling costs 
impaired loans a loan is normally deemed impaired when it is probable we will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a valuation allowance is established when the fair value of the property that collateralizes the impaired loan  if any  is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
our impaired loans at december   net of their related allowance for loan losses of million  totaled million 
interest income recognized on impaired loans amounted to  for the year ended december  for further detail on our impaired loans  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in
