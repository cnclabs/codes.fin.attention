our business we receive revenues primarily from the delivery of residential  training  educational and support services to various populations with special needs 
as of december   we had three reportable operating segments i community services  ii job corps training services and iii employment training services 
management s discussion and analysis of each segment is included below 
further information regarding our segments is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues for our community services operations are derived primarily from state medicaid programs  other government agencies  commercial insurance companies and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state government agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid program 
our services include social  functional and vocational skills training  supported employment and emotional and psychological counseling for individuals with intellectual or other disabilities 
we also provide respite  therapeutic and other services to individuals with special needs and to older people in their homes 
these services are provided on an as needed basis or hourly basis through our periodic in home services programs that are reimbursed on a unit of service basis 
reimbursement varies by state and service type  and may be based on a variety of methods including flat rate  cost based reimbursement  per person per diem  or unit of service basis 
generally  rates are adjusted annually based upon historical costs experienced by us and by other service providers  or economic conditions and their impact on state budgets 

table of contents at facilities and programs where we are the provider of record  we are directly reimbursed under state medicaid programs for services we provide and such revenues are affected by occupancy levels 
at most facilities and programs that we operate pursuant to management contracts  the management fee is negotiated with the provider of record 
we operate vocational training centers under the federal job corps program administered by the dol through our job corps training services operations 
under job corps contracts  we are reimbursed for direct facility and program costs related to job corps center operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee 
the management fee takes the form of a fixed contractual amount plus a computed amount based on certain performance criteria 
all of such amounts are reflected as revenue  and all such direct costs are reflected as facility and program costs 
final determination of amounts due under job corps contracts is subject to audit and review by the dol  and renewals and extension of job corps contracts are based in part on performance reviews 
we operate job training and placement programs that assist disadvantaged job seekers in finding employment and improving their career prospects through our employment training services operations 
these programs are administered under contracts with local and state governments 
we are typically reimbursed for direct facility and program costs related to the job training centers  allowable indirect costs plus a fee for profit 
the fee can take the form of a fixed contractual amount rate or price or be computed based on certain performance criteria 
the contracts are funded by federal agencies  including the dol and department of health and human services 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection  and application of our critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from medicaid programs  other government agencies and commercial insurance companies 
an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including historical loss rates  age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors  general economic conditions and the status of state budgets 
complex rules and regulations regarding billing and timely filing requirements in various states are also a factor in our assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change of estimate 
there were no material changes in our method of providing for reserves for doubtful accounts during insurance losses we self insure a substantial portion of our professional  general and automobile liability  workers compensation and health benefit risks 

table of contents provisions for losses for these risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates and include an amount determined from reported claims and an amount based on past experiences for losses incurred but not reported 
these liabilities are necessarily based on estimates and  while we believe that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the amounts recorded 
the liabilities are reviewed quarterly and any adjustments are reflected in earnings in the period known 
there have been no material changes to our method of providing reserves for insurance risks during further information regarding our insurance programs is contained elsewhere in this document under risk factors 
legal contingencies we are party to numerous claims and lawsuits with respect to various matters 
the material legal proceedings in which rescare is currently involved are described in item of this report and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably determinable 
we confer with outside counsel in estimating our potential liability for certain legal contingencies 
while we believe our provision for legal contingencies is adequate  the outcome of legal proceedings is difficult to predict and we may settle legal claims or be subject to judgments for amounts that exceed our estimates 
there were no material changes to our method of providing reserves for legal contingencies during valuation of long lived assets we regularly review the carrying value of long lived assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  loss of contracts  significant census declines  reductions in reimbursement levels and significant litigation 
our evaluation is based on cash flow  profitability and projections that incorporate current or projected operating results  as well as significant events or changes in the reimbursement and regulatory environment 
if circumstances suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value based upon various techniques to estimate fair value 
during  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling million in connection with our withdrawal from the district of columbia district and the state of new mexico 
these changes  which were primarily related to the write down of leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment  are reported as part of discontinued operations 
unrelated to the withdrawal  in the second quarter of we recorded a charge of million related to asset impairment of certain land and buildings 
we recorded no other material asset valuation losses during goodwill with respect to businesses we have acquired  we evaluate the costs of purchased businesses in excess of net assets acquired goodwill for impairment at least annually as of year end  unless significant changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may have occurred sooner 
we are required to test goodwill on a reporting unit basis 
we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment and recognize an impairment charge for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
fair values are established using a weighted average of comparative market multiples in the current market conditions and discounted cash flows 
discounted cash flow computations depend on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
the discount rates used as of our year end annual impairment evaluation for the community services  job corps training services  employment training services and other reporting units were   and  respectively 
a variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the analysis 
in addition  we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in determining market multiples in valuing our reporting units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate values for each of our reporting units 
no goodwill impairment charges were recorded during 
table of contents at december   we had approximately million of goodwill related to our employment training services operating segment 
recently  this operation has performed unfavorably as compared to our internal forecasts and expectations 
management has developed plans to improve the operating results of this operating segment 
if these plans ultimately prove unsuccessful  we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge associated with this operation 
revenue recognition community services 
revenues are derived primarily from state medicaid programs  other government agencies  commercial insurance companies and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid programs 
revenues are recorded at rates established at or before the time services are rendered 
revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered 
job corps training services 
revenues include amounts reimbursable under cost reimbursement contracts with the dol for operating job corps centers 
the contracts provide reimbursement for all facility and program costs related to operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee  normally a combination of fixed and performance based 
final determination of amounts due under the contracts is subject to audit and review by the applicable government agencies 
revenue is recognized in the period associated costs are incurred and services are rendered 
employment training services 
revenues are derived primarily through contracts with local and state governments funded by federal agencies 
revenue is generated from contracts which contain various pricing arrangements  including cost reimbursable  performance based  and hybrid  which are a combination of cost reimbursable and performance based contracts 
with cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized for the direct costs associated with functions that are specific to the contract  plus an indirect cost percentage that is applied to the direct costs  plus a profit 
revenue is recognized in the period the associated costs are incurred and services are rendered 
under a performance based contract  revenue is generally recognized as earned based upon the attainment of a unit performance measure times the fixed unit price for that specific performance measure 
typically  there are many different performance measures that are stipulated in the contract that must be tracked to support the billing and revenue recognition 
revenue may be recognized prior to achieving a benchmark as long as reliable measurements of progress to date activity can be obtained  indicating that it is probable that the benchmark will be achieved 
this requires judgment in determining what is considered to be a reliable measurement 
revenues for hybrid contracts are generally recognized based on the specific contract language 
the most common type of hybrid contract is cost plus  which provide for the reimbursement of direct and indirect costs with profit tied to meeting certain performance measures 
revenues for cost plus contracts are recognized in the period the associated costs are incurred with an estimate made for the performance based portion  as long as reliable measurements of progress to date activity can be obtained  indicating that it is probable that the benchmark will be achieved 
this requires judgment in determining what is considered to be a reliable measurement 
laws and regulations governing the government programs and contracts are complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
for each operating segment  expenses are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for potential adjustments arising from such examinations 
there were no material changes in the application of our revenue recognition policies during 
table of contents results of operations year ended december dollars in thousands revenues community services job corps training services employment training services other consolidated operating income community services job corps training services employment training services other total operating expenses consolidated operating margin community services job corps training services employment training services consolidated excludes results for washington  dc and new mexico  which were reclassified to discontinued operations for all years presented 
represents corporate general and administrative expenses  other operating income and expenses  and a loss on refinancing in consolidated consolidated revenues increased million in  compared to  for an increase of 
the increase is primarily related to acquisitions completed in and organic growth 
consolidated revenues increased million  or in from revenues are more fully described in the segment discussions below 
consolidated operating income increased in and operating margin increased to from 
the operating income included a debt refinancing charge of million  which negatively impacted the operating margin for the operating margin improved in the community services segment  primarily due to growth in higher margin periodic services and favorable insurance expense trends  but were offset by a decrease in employment training services margin  primarily due to unfavorable leverage on lost contracts 
these issues are discussed further in the segment sections which follow 
operating income increased in from and operating margin decreased from to 
as noted above  the operating income included a debt refinancing charge of million 
the operating income increase is primarily attributable to revenue growth and operating margin improvement in the community services segment 
as a percentage of total revenues  total operating expenses were in  in  and in the improvement in was primarily related to leverage on increased revenue  offset partially by share based compensation of million in the percentage was higher due to the refinancing charge 
net interest expense increased million in compared to due primarily to higher average debt balances  which was partially offset by a full year s lower interest rate due to the debt refinancing in october net interest expense decreased million in compared to due primarily to higher interest rates on investments  the debt refinancing in october and the redemption of the convertible subordinated notes in march 
table of contents our effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for is higher due to increased income and less non taxable investment income than the effective rate for is lower than the statutory rate principally due to non taxable investment income and the benefit of increased job credits  as compared to community services community services revenues increased in over compared to a increase in over these increases were due primarily to acquisitions and growth in periodic in home services 
in  our community services segment acquired operations with annual revenues of million  and in acquired operations with annual revenues of million 
periodic in home service revenues increased million in over operating margin increased in over  to from  as a result of acquisitions and growth in higher margin periodic in home services  and favorable insurance trends  primarily workers compensation expense 
operating margin increased in over to from  as a result of continued growth in the periodic in home services  multiple acquisitions in and continued cost controls 
further  insurance costs  including workers compensation  decreased as a percentage of revenue approximately basis points as compared to there is current legislation  which has already passed the senate  that would increase the federal minimum wage to per hour over the course of two years 
if approved by the house and signed by the president  this legislation would increase our labor costs in the future 
job corps training services job corps training services revenues increased in over and in over due primarily to the addition of the northlands job corps center in july and contractual increases 
operating margins in  and were similar for all periods 
employment training services employment training services revenues increased million in over  due primarily to the workforce services acquisition in january  which accounted for approximately million  and increases of nearly million related to the new york city wecare contract 
operating income for this segment increased million for over operating margin decreased from in to in effective in the third quarter of  the results include a decline in revenues and a basis point decline in operating margin from the second quarter of the decrease in the third quarter of is primarily attributable to contract non renewals and fewer contract awards in addition to unfavorable modifications to existing contracts  generally effective july  in particular  two significant workforce services contracts were not renewed when their terms ended shortly after the january acquisition 
the contract for dallas  texas was not renewed as of april   due primarily to prior performance issues 
at that time  we were not given an opportunity to implement improvements 
we were able to immediately reduce our overhead expenses  which helped to reduce the negative impact of this non renewal 
we also lost a workforce services contract in tampa  florida  which was not renewed as of july  this contract was lost primarily due to the local political environment during our post acquisition transition 
for this tampa contract  we were not able to reduce our overhead expenses in a timely fashion  which contributed to the unfavorable impact on operating income 
the combined annual revenues of the dallas and tampa contracts was approximately million  of which only million was recorded in our revenues due to the non renewals 
these issues have not surfaced in our other contracts obtained with the workforce services acquisition 
the operating results included higher amortization expense due to the intangible assets acquired in the workforce services acquisition which was completed in the first quarter of 
table of contents employment training services revenues increased in over due primarily to the acquisition of the operations of tti america tti in the fourth quarter of and a new contract in new york city in tti and the new york city contract added combined revenues of million in operating income for this segment increased for over  however operating margins decreased basis points primarily due to the start up of the new york city contract 
other a small portion of our business is dedicated to operating charter schools and international job training and placement agencies 
revenues from this segment more than doubled over the prior year periods 
the primary reason for the increase is the new education contracts that were acquired with the workforce services acquisition in january discontinued operations net loss from discontinued operations was million for  million in and million in included in net loss from discontinued operations for the  is a pre tax charge of million for impaired assets and abandoned leased facilities and pretax operational losses of million  offset by a tax benefit of million 
the discontinued operations relate to the community services segment s exit from the district of columbia and the state of new mexico  which were effective on march  and october   respectively 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total assets increased in over accounts receivable increased primarily due to the workforce services acquisition and other growth 
primarily as a result of the workforce services acquisition  and other acquisitions during  goodwill increased million from december  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million for and million for the decrease in was the result of funding working capital requirements for the acquisitions  offset by an increase in net income 
the increase in from was primarily the result of higher net income excluding the refinancing charge  offset by net working capital needs 
days revenue in net accounts receivable were days at december  compared with days at december  and days at december  the increase in the number of days is attributable to a few states extending payment terms and to the growth in the employment training services segment 
net accounts receivable at december  increased to million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in net accounts receivable from to is primarily due to revenue growth associated with the acquisitions and contract awards 
approximately  and of the total net accounts receivable balance was greater than days at december   december  and december   respectively 
capital expenditures were consistent with our historical experience  comprised principally of maintenance capital expenditures  with a less significant amount expended for strategic systems 
we invested million million cash and million in seller notes in  of which the acquisition of workforce services was million and all other acquisitions totaled million 
we invested over million million in cash and million in seller notes in acquiring various businesses in our community services group 
similarly  approximately million million in cash and million in seller notes was expended in on businesses operating in both employment training services and community services 

table of contents our financing activities during included net borrowings of million on the revolver and million in proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions 
these inflows were offset by payments of debt of million and million in debt issuance costs associated with amending our credit facility 
option exercise activity resulted in million in proceeds and million in tax benefits 
our financing activities during include the repayment of the million senior notes  the million term loan and the convertible subordinated notes  offset by proceeds from the new million senior notes 
we also incurred various costs in connection with the october refinancing 
option exercise activity resulted in million in proceeds in cash provided by financing activities in was attributable primarily to the june issuance of preferred stock to onex partners 
our capital requirements relate primarily to our plans to expand through selective acquisitions and the development of new facilities and programs  and our need for sufficient working capital for general corporate purposes 
since most of our facilities and programs are operating at or near capacity  and budgetary pressures and other forces are expected to limit increases in reimbursement rates we receive  our ability to continue to grow at the current rate depends directly on our acquisition and development activity 
we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments from our operating cash flow and utilization of our credit facility 
as of december   we had irrevocable standby letters of credit in the principal amount of million issued primarily in connection with our insurance programs 
on june   we amended our existing senior secured credit facility 
the amendment reduced certain borrowing cost margins and increased the revolving credit facility by million to a total of million 
additional capacity of million remains in place  which allows us to expand our total borrowing capacity to million 
the credit facility expires on october  and will be used primarily for working capital purposes  letters of credit required under our insurance programs and for acquisitions 
the credit facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets and  through secured guarantees  on all of our domestic subsidiaries assets 
as of december   we had million available under the revolver with an outstanding balance of million 
outstanding balances bear interest at over the libor or other bank developed rates at our option 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate was 
letters of credit had a borrowing rate of as of december  the commitment fee on the unused balance is 
the margin over libor and the commitment fee are determined quarterly based on our leverage ratio  as defined by the revolving credit facility 
the amended and restated credit facility contains various financial covenants relating to net worth  capital expenditures and rentals and requires us to maintain specified ratios with respect to our interest and leverage 
we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of december  our ability to achieve the thresholds provided for in the financial covenants largely depends upon the maintenance of continued profitability and or reductions of amounts borrowed under the facility  and continued cash collections 
on october   we issued million of senior notes due october  in a private placement under rule a of the securities act of the new senior notes  which had an issue price of of the principal amount  are unsecured obligations ranking equal to existing and future debt and are subordinate to existing and future secured debt 
the senior notes are jointly  severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our owned us subsidiaries 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the senior notes to repurchase our senior notes due november  the new senior notes were registered under the securities act of in february operating funding sources for were approximately through medicaid reimbursement  from the dol and from other payors 

table of contents we believe our sources of funds through operations and available through the credit facility described above will be sufficient to meet our working capital  planned capital expenditure and scheduled debt repayment requirements for the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and commitments information concerning our contractual obligations and commercial commitments follows in thousands payments due by period twelve months ending december and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases fixed interest payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations total contractual obligations excludes any interest payments on our variable rate debt 
amount of commitments expiring per period twelve months ending december other commercial total amounts and commitments committed thereafter standby letters of credit surety bonds we had no significant off balance sheet transactions or interests in new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of any outstanding variable rate debt  we do not currently utilize any derivative financial instruments related to our interest rate exposure 
our senior secured credit facility  which has an interest rate based on margins over libor or prime  tiered based upon leverage calculations  had an outstanding balance of million as of december  and no borrowings as of december  a basis point movement in the interest rate would result in an approximate million annualized effect on interest expense and cash flows
