table of contents heco the information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to selected financial data on page of heco exhibit item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with hei s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the general discussion of hei s consolidated results should be read in conjunction with the segment discussions of the electric utilities and the bank that follow 
hei consolidated executive overview and strategy the company s three strategic objectives  currently  are to operate the electric utility and bank subsidiaries for long term growth  maintain the annual dividend and increase the company s financial flexibility by strengthening the balance sheet and maintaining credit ratings 
hei  through heco and its electric utility subsidiaries  hawaii electric light company  inc helco and maui electric company  limited meco  provide the only electric public utility service to approximately of hawaii s population 
hei also provides a wide array of banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses through its bank subsidiary  asb  hawaii s third largest financial institution based on asset size 
in  income from continuing operations was million  compared to million in basic earnings per share from continuing operations were per share in  down from per share in due to lower earnings at the bank and other segments  partly offset by slightly higher earnings at the electric utilities 
the electric utilities earnings benefited from interim rate relief and slightly higher kilowatthour kwh sales  but were also impacted by higher expenses  which were expected and are expected to continue 
the bank s earnings were hurt by the challenging interest rate environment a flat or inverted yield curve throughout and higher legal and litigation related expenses  but the core business performed well as loans grew and deposits stabilized 
the other segment s million loss in was larger than the million loss in primarily due to a one time net gain of million on the sale of a leveraged lease investment in the company s operations are heavily influenced by hawaii s economy  which is driven by tourism  the federal government including the military  real estate and construction 
per the state of hawaii department of business  economic development and tourism dbedt  hawaii real gross state product grew by an estimated in and is expected to grow by a forecasted in shareholder dividends are declared and paid quarterly by hei at the discretion of hei s board of directors 
hei and its predecessor company  heco  have paid dividends continuously since the dividend has been stable at per share annually since split adjusted 
the indicated dividend yield as of december  was 
hei s board believes that hei should have a payout ratio of or lower on a sustainable basis and that cash flows should support an increase before it considers increasing the common stock dividend above its current level 
the dividend payout ratios based on net income for  and were  and payout ratios of  and based on income from continuing operations  respectively 
the payout ratio for was higher due to the lower net income 
the payout ratio for was impacted by a charge to net income of million due to a june adverse tax ruling and subsequent settlement and an increased number of shares outstanding from the sale of million shares pre split of common stock in march without the bank franchise tax charge  the payout ratio for would have been based on income from continuing operations 
in the first half of  hei strengthened its balance sheet through a common stock sale and repayment and refinancing of debt 
hei s subsidiaries from time to time consider various strategies designed to enhance their competitive positions and to maximize shareholder value 
these strategies may include the formation of new subsidiaries or the acquisition or disposition of businesses 
the company may from time to time be engaged in preliminary 
table of contents discussions  either internally or with third parties  regarding potential transactions 
management cannot predict whether any of these strategies or transactions will be carried out or  if so  whether they will be successfully implemented 
see the electric utility and bank sections for their respective executive overviews and strategies 
economic conditions note the statistical data in this section is from public third party sources eg  dbedt  eg census bureau and bloomberg 
because its core businesses provide local electric utility and banking services  hei s operating results are significantly influenced by the strength of hawaii s economy 
the state s economic growth  which is fueled by the two largest components of hawaii s economy tourism and the federal government is estimated by the dbedt to have been in dbedt expects that growth will further moderate to in and in following two exceptional years of growth  tourism in hawaii remained strong with visitor expenditures reaching a record billion in  a increase over visitor days were slightly lower by compared to the record high level 
state economists expect continued growth in with projected increases of in visitor days and in visitor expenditures 
hawaii was the fifth ranking state in federal government expenditures per capita in the latest available data 
for the federal fiscal year ended september  latest available data  total federal government expenditures in hawaii  including military expenditures  were billion or  per capita  increasing and  respectively  over fiscal year military spending  which is of federal expenditures in hawaii  increased in compared to the real estate and construction industries in hawaii also influence hei s core businesses 
the oahu housing market continued to stabilize in with home sales volume down by compared to total dollar sales volume for was billion  down  compared to the same period of however  oahu home sales prices continued to increase with the average median price for a single family home of  for  compared to  for the construction industry continues to remain strong as indicated by an increase in building permits compared to local economists expect a gradual slowing in residential construction as rising costs meet flattening demand 
however  it is expected that increased military and commercial construction will be stabilizing factors 
overall  the outlook for the hawaii economy remains positive 
however  economic growth is affected by the rate of expansion in the mainland us and japan economies and the growth in military spending  and is vulnerable to uncertainties in the world s geopolitical environment 
management also monitors oil prices because of their impact on the rates the utilities charge for electricity and the potential effect of increased electricity prices on usage and interest rates because of their potential impact on asb s earnings  hei s and heco s cost of capital and pension costs  and hei s stock price 
crude oil prices hovered around per barrel in the first half of due to geopolitical fallout from iran s renewed nuclear program and risks of supply disruption 
prices remained high during the third quarter of and came off their high levels toward year end due to a slowing us economy and lessening concerns about iran s continuing its nuclear program 
the average fuel oil cost per barrel for the electric utilities increased in compared to on february   crude oil futures closed at per barrel 
for most of  long term interest rates fluctuated in the to trading range and the short end of the yield curve continued to increase 
this resulted in an inverted yield curve for most of which is indicative of a difficult earning environment for asb 
as of december   the yield curve was inverted with a spread between the year and year treasuries of  compared to the yield curve as of december   with a spread of

taking into account the adjustments in the table above  hei s consolidated income from continuing operations would have been flat compared to 
table of contents retirement benefits the company s reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future experience 
for example  retirement benefits costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and compensation levels  the level of contributions to the plans  earnings and realized and unrealized gains and losses on plan assets and changes made to the provisions of the plans 
no changes were made to the retirement benefit plans provisions in  and that have had a significant impact on costs 
costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the company accounts for retirement benefit costs in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and thus  changes in obligations associated with the factors noted above may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
the assumptions used by management in making benefit and funding calculations are based on current economic conditions 
changes in economic conditions will impact the underlying assumptions in determining retirement benefits costs on a prospective basis 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  the company considered the moody s daily long term corporate bond aa yield average which was as of december  compared to as of december  and changes in this rate from period to period 
in addition  the company also considered the plans actuarial consultant s cashflow matching analysis based upon bond information provided by standard poors for all high quality bonds ie  rated aa or better as of december  in selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets  the company considers economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans primarily equity and fixed income investments  the plans asset allocations and the past performance of the plans assets

in november  s p affirmed its corporate credit ratings of hei and maintained its negative outlook 
s p s ratings outlook assesses the potential direction of a long term credit rating over the intermediate term typically six months to two years 
s p indicated failure to strengthen key financial parameters  especially cash flow coverage of debt  a slump in the hawaiian economy  a punitive final rate order  and  although not expected  a major erosion in american savings bank s creditworthiness could lead to lower ratings

a portion of the net assets of heco and asb is not available for transfer to hei in the form of dividends  loans or advances without regulatory approval 
one of the conditions of the merger and corporate restructuring of heco and hei requires that heco maintain a consolidated common equity to total capitalization ratio of not less than  and restricts heco from making distributions to hei to the extent it would result in that ratio being less than 
in the absence of an unexpected material adverse change in the financial condition of the electric utilities or asb  such restrictions are not expected to significantly affect the operations of hei  its ability to pay dividends on its common stock or its ability to meet its debt or other cash obligations

as further explained in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements  the company maintains pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
funding for the qualified pension plans is based upon actuarially determined contributions that consider the amount deductible for income tax purposes and the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
the company was not required to make any contributions to the qualified pension plans to meet minimum funding requirements pursuant to erisa for  and  but the company s pension investment committee chose to make tax deductible contributions in those years 
the electric utilities policy is to comply with directives from the puc to fund the costs of the postretirement benefit plan 
these costs are ultimately collected in rates billed to customers 
the company reserves the right to change  modify or terminate the plans and  historically  benefits have been changed from time to time 
from time to time in the past  benefits have changed 
contributions to the retirement benefit plans totaled million in comprised of million made by the utilities and million by asb  million in and million in includes company payments for nonqualified plans in and  but not 
contributions to the retirement benefits plans are expected to total million in million by the utilities and million by asb 
depending on the performance of the assets held in the plans trusts and numerous other factors  additional contributions may be required in the future to

electric utility executive overview and strategy the electric utilities are vertically integrated and regulated by the puc 
the island utility systems are not interconnected  which requires that additional reliability be built into the systems  but also means that the utilities are not exposed to the risks of inter ties 
the electric utilities strategic focus has been to meet hawaii s growing energy needs through a combination of diverse activities modernizing and adding needed infrastructure through capital investment  placing emphasis on energy efficiency and conservation  pursuing renewable energy options and technology opportunities such as combined heat and power and distributed generation dg and taking the necessary steps to secure regulatory support for their plans 
reliability projects  including projects to increase generation reserves to meet growing peak demand  remain a priority for heco and its subsidiaries 
on oahu  heco is in the early permitting stages for a new generating unit  which is projected to be placed in service in  and is making progress with plans to build the east oahu transmission project eotp  a needed alternative route to move power from the west side of the island 
heco installed a new energy management system in and is scheduled to complete a new dispatch center on oahu in puc approvals have been obtained for the new outage management and customer information systems  which will also be integrated 
on the island of hawaii  after years of delay  the two megawatt mw combustion turbines at keahole are operating 
on the island of maui  an mw steam turbine at the maalaea power plant site was installed in further  the utilities have demand side management dsm rebate programs and are considering additional dg at utility owned sites eg  substations as another measure to potentially help meet growing peak demand 
major infrastructure projects can have a pronounced impact on the communities in which they are located 
the electric utilities continue to expand their community outreach and consultation process so they can better understand and evaluate community concerns early in the process 
with large power users in the electric utilities service territories  such as the us military  hotels and state and local government  management believes that retaining customers by maintaining customer satisfaction is a critical component in achieving kilowatthour kwh sales and revenue growth over time 
the electric utilities have established programs that offer these customers specialized services and energy efficiency audits to help them save on energy costs 

table of contents in november  heco filed a request with the puc to increase base rates  primarily for costs relating to existing and proposed energy conservation and efficiency programs dsm programs  costs of capital improvement projects  the proposed purchase of additional firm capacity and energy  costs of other measures taken to address peak load increases  and increased operation and maintenance expenses 
interim rate relief was granted in late september the puc issued a bifurcation order separating heco s requests for approval and or modification of its existing and proposed dsm programs from the rate case proceeding into a new docket ee dsm docket 
the dsm programs  with certain modifications  were approved in february see most recent rate requests heco and other regulatory matters demand side management programs 
in may  december and february  helco  heco and meco filed requests with the puc to increase base rates by million  million and million  respectively

the electric utilities long term plan to meet hawaii s future energy needs includes their support of a range of energy choices  including renewable energy and new power supply technologies such as dg 
the puc has issued a decision and framework in a competitive bidding proceeding and a decision in a dg proceeding see certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition consolidated competition electric utility 
heco s subsidiary  renewable hawaii  inc rhi  has initial approval from the heco board of directors to fund investments by rhi of up to million in selected renewable energy projects to help bring online commercially feasible renewable energy sources in hawaii 
net income for heco and its subsidiaries was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to the impact of heco s interim rate increase granted by the puc in late september  largely offset by increased operation and maintenance expenses including more extensive maintenance on generating units  which are getting older and are being run harder to meet the higher peak demand for electricity  and higher retirement benefits expense and higher depreciation expense due to investments in capital projects

kwh sales increased from primarily due to new load growth ie  increase in number of customers  largely offset by the impacts of cooler and less humid weather and customer conservation 
cooling degree days for oahu were lower in compared to the electric utilities are currently estimating kwh sales for and to increase over the prior year by and  respectively 
the higher fuel prices are also reflected in the higher amount of customer accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues 

table of contents operating income in was million higher than in due primarily to the impact of heco s interim rate increase in late september  partly offset by higher other expenses  including higher maintenance and retirement benefit expenses  and the discontinuation of the recovery of dsm lost margins and shareholder incentives 
fuel oil and purchased power expenses in increased by and  respectively  due primarily to higher fuel prices  which are generally passed on to customers 
other expenses increased in due to an or million increase in other operation expense  a or million increase in maintenance expense  a or million increase in depreciation expense  and a or million increase in taxes  other than income taxes  primarily due to the increase in revenues 
other operation expenses increased in when compared to due primarily to million higher expenses for production operations including expenses incurred to sustain or increase generating unit availability and lease rent and operating expenses for distributed generation units on oahu  higher dsm expenses which are generally passed on to customers through a surcharge  and higher retirement benefits expenses 
pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for the electric utilities increased million over due in part to the adoption of a basis points lower discount rate as of december  maintenance expenses increased due to million higher production maintenance expense primarily due to generating plant maintenance and an increase in the number and greater scope of generating unit overhauls and million higher transmission and distribution maintenance expense including higher substation maintenance  vegetation management and distribution line maintenance expenses 
higher depreciation expense was attributable to additions to plant in service in including heco s new kuahua substation  mokuone substation kilovolt kv and kv line extensions  an office building air conditioning replacement and helco s keahole power plant noise mitigation measures 
the trend of increased operation and maintenance o m expenses is expected to continue as the electric utilities expect higher dsm expenses that are generally passed on to customers through a surcharge  including additional expenses for programs that have been approved pursuant to a final decision and order d o in an ee dsm docket  higher employee benefit expenses  primarily for retirement benefits  and higher production expenses  primarily to support the increased level of peak demand that has occurred over the past five years 
as a result of load growth on oahu and other factors  there currently is an increased risk to generation reliability 
existing units are running harder  resulting in more frequent and more extensive maintenance  at times requiring temporary shut downs of these units 
generation reserve margins on oahu and maui during peak periods continued to be strained 
the electric utilities on oahu and maui have taken a number of steps to mitigate the risk of outages  including securing additional purchased power  adding distributed generation at some substations and encouraging energy conservation 
the marginal costs of supplying energy to meet growing demand  however  are increasing because of the decreasing peak reserve margin situation  and the trend of cost increases is not likely to ease 
in  the electric utilities revenues increased by  or million  from primarily due to higher fuel prices million  interim rate relief granted by the puc in late september million and increased shareholder incentives and lost margins million  including the surcharge transferred to base rates in the interim rate relief granted in september kwh sales increased from primarily due to new load growth ie  increase in number of customers  largely offset by the impacts of cooler and less humid weather and major commercial repair and renovation projects 
cooling degree days for oahu were lower in compared to in addition  customers may have been moderating their energy usage in response to the electric utilities campaign to promote conservation and efficiency and possibly reacting to higher fuel prices reflected in electric bills 
the higher fuel prices are also reflected in the higher amount of customer accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues 
operating income in was million lower than in mainly due to higher other expenses  including higher maintenance and retirement benefit expenses

other operation expenses increased in when compared to due primarily to higher expenses for production operations including higher environmental expenses as there was a department of health of the state of hawaii doh emission fee waiver in  which was not repeated in  transmission and distribution operations and retirement benefits 
pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for the electric utilities increased million over the same period in due in part to the hei pension investment committee s adoption of a basis points lower discount rate as of december  maintenance expenses increased due to higher production maintenance expense primarily due to generating plant maintenance and generating unit overhauls and higher transmission and distribution maintenance expense 
higher depreciation expense was attributable to additions to plant in service in including helco s ct and ct and heco s waiau fuel oil pipeline  offset in part by lower depreciation expense resulting from the puc s approval in september of rates and accounting methodology applicable to heco s depreciable assets on oahu 
most recent rate requests the electric utilities initiate puc proceedings from time to time to request electric rate increases to cover rising operating costs and the cost of plant and equipment  including the cost of new capital projects to maintain and improve service reliability 
the puc may grant an interim increase within to months following the filing of the application  however  there is no guarantee of such an interim increase 
similarly  the timing and amount of any final increase is up to the discretion of the puc 
as of february   the return on average common equity roace found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent final rate decision for each utility was for heco d o issued on december   based on a test year  for helco d o issued on february   based on a test year and for meco amended d o issued on april   based on a test year 
the roace used for purposes of the interim rate increase in heco s rate case based on a test year was 
for  the simple average roaces calculated under the rate making method and reported to the puc  which calculations included the aoci charges due to the application of sfas no 
 for heco  helco and meco were  and  respectively  if the aoci charges due to sfas no 
were excluded  these roaces would have been  and  respectively 
heco s actual roace continues to be significantly lower than its allowed roace primarily because of increased o m expenses  which are expected to continue and have resulted in heco seeking rate relief more often than in the past 
the interim rate relief granted to heco by the puc in september see below was based in part on increased costs of operating and maintaining heco s system 
helco s roace will continue to be negatively impacted by ct and ct as electric rates will not change for the unit additions unless and until the puc grants rate relief in the helco rate case based on a test year see below 
as of february   the return on rate base ror found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent final rate decision for each utility was for heco  for helco and for meco d os noted above 
however  the ror used for purposes of the interim d o in the heco rate case based on a test year was 
for  the simple average rors calculated under the rate making method and reported to the puc for heco  helco and meco were  and  respectively 
the utilities have had  and may in the future have  significant charges to aoci related to the funded status of their retirement benefit plans  which decrease their common stock equity 
absent appropriate regulatory relief in rate cases  the resulting increase in the electric utilities rors and roaces could impact the rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge  which may ultimately result in reduced revenues and lower earnings

heco 
test year rate case 
in november  heco filed a request with the puc to increase base rates  or million in annual base revenues  based on a test year  a ror and an roace 
the requested increase included transferring the cost of existing dsm programs from a surcharge line item on electric bills into base electricity charges 
heco also requested approval and or modification of its existing and proposed 
table of contents dsm programs  and associated utility incentive mechanism 
excluding the surcharge transfer amount  the requested net increase to customers was  or million 
in march  the puc issued a bifurcation order separating heco s requests for approval and or modification of its existing and proposed dsm programs from the rate case proceeding into a new docket ee dsm docket 
the issues for the ee dsm docket include whether  and if so  what  energy efficiency goals should be established  whether the proposed and or other dsm programs will achieve the established energy efficiency goals and be implemented in a cost effective manner  what market structures are most appropriate for providing these or other dsm programs  for utility incurred costs  what cost recovery mechanisms and cost levels are appropriate  whether  and if so  what incentive mechanisms are appropriate to encourage the implementation of dsm programs  and which dsm programs should be approved  modified  or rejected 
the parties participants for all issues include heco  the division of consumer advocacy  department of commerce and consumer affairs of the state of hawaii consumer advocate  the federal department of defense dod  the county of maui  two renewable energy organizations  an energy efficiency organization  and an environmental organization 
helco  meco  kauai island utility cooperative  the gas company and the county of kauai are parties participants solely for issues dealing with statewide energy policies 
the us environmental protection agency epa and its consultants also have been involved in an advisory capacity to the puc  and have submitted comments on the proposed dsm programs and the issues in this proceeding 
see other regulatory matters demand side management programs below for additional information on this docket and a discussion of the puc s interim d o issued on april  in september  heco  the consumer advocate and the dod reached agreement subject to puc approval among themselves on most of the issues in the rate case proceeding  excluding the portion of the original rate case bifurcated into the ee dsm docket 
the remaining significant issue not resolved among the parties was the appropriateness of including in rate base approximately million related to heco s prepaid pension asset  net of deferred income taxes 
later in september  the puc issued its interim d o with tariff changes effective september  and amounts collected refundable  with interest  to ratepayers to the extent they exceed the amount approved in the final d o 
for purposes of the interim d o  the puc included heco s prepaid pension asset in rate base with an annual rate increase impact of approximately million 
the following amounts were included in heco s rebuttal  the consumer advocate s and the dod s testimonies and exhibits as adjusted to exclude the transferred surcharge amount of million  the settlement agreement with the consumer advocate and the dod  and the puc s interim d o pre settlement dollars in millions heco rebuttal consumer advocate department of defense heco per settlement interim increase net additional revenues roace ror average rate base effective september   subject to refund with interest pending the final outcome of the case 
excludes million transferred from a surcharge to base rates for existing energy efficiency programs 
the adoption of revenue  expense  rate base and cost of capital amounts including the roace and ror for purposes of an interim rate increase does not commit the puc to accept any such amounts in its final d o 
on june   the puc issued an order in heco s pending rate case based on a test year  indicating that the record in the pending case has not been developed for the purpose of addressing the factors in act act  which was effective in june  requires the puc to consider certain specific factors in evaluating fuel adjustment clauses 
see energy cost adjustment clauses in note of heco s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the puc s order requested the parties in the rate case proceeding to meet informally to determine a procedural schedule to address the issues relating to heco s ecac that are raised by act the parties in the rate case proceeding are heco  the consumer advocate  and the dod 

table of contents on june   heco and the consumer advocate filed a stipulation requesting that the puc not review the act ecac issues in the pending rate case based on a test year since heco s application was filed and the record in the proceeding was completed before act was signed into law  and the settlement agreement entered into by the parties in the rate case included a provision allowing the existing ecac to be continued 
on august   an amended stipulation was filed in substantially the same form as the june  stipulation  but also included the dod 
management cannot predict whether the puc will accept the disposition of the act issue proposed in the amended stipulation or  if not  the procedural steps or procedural schedule that will be adopted to address the issues that are raised by act  the ultimate outcome of these issues  the effect of these issues on the operation of the ecac as it relates to the electric utilities or the timing of the puc s issuance of a final d o in heco s pending rate case based on a test year 
test year rate case 
on december   heco filed a request with the puc for a general rate increase of million  or over the electric rates currently in effect  based on a test year  an rate of ror  an roace and a billion average rate base 
heco s electric rates currently in effect include the interim rate increase discussed above of million million net additional revenues granted by the puc in september  which is subject to a final d o from the puc  and is subject to refund with interest if and to the extent that the final d o provides for a lesser increase 
if the additional revenues from the interim increase were ultimately not included in rates  the total increase requested would be million 
this rate case excluded dsm surcharge revenues and associated incremental dsm costs because certain dsm issues  including cost recovery  are being addressed in the ee dsm docket 
heco s application includes a proposed new tiered rate structure for residential customers to reward customers who practice energy conservation with lower electric rates for lower monthly usage 
the proposed rate increase includes costs incurred to maintain and improve reliability  such as a new dispatch center building and associated equipment and the energy management system that became operational in  new substations  a new outage management system to be added in and increased o m expenses 
the application addresses the ecac provisions of act and requests the continuation of heco s ecac 
on december   the electric utilities report on power cost adjustments and hedging fuel risks ecac report was filed with the puc 
the ecac report was prepared by the electric utilities consultant who was retained to determine whether their existing ecacs are in compliance with act the testimonies filed in the latest rate cases for heco  helco and meco included or incorporated the ecac report  which concluded that the electric utilities ecacs are well designed  and benefit the electric utilities and their ratepayers  and the ecacs comply with the statutory requirements of act with respect to hedging  the consultants concluded that hedging of oil by heco would not be expected to reduce fuel and purchased power costs and in fact would be expected to increase the level of such costs  and even if rate smoothing is a desired goal  there may be more effective means of meeting the goal  and there is no compelling reason for the electric utilities to use fuel price hedging as the means to achieving the objective of increased rate stability 
heco s application requests a return on heco s pension assets ie  accumulated contributions in excess of accumulated net periodic pension costs by including such assets net of deferred taxes in rate base 
in a separate proceeding  the electric utilities requested the puc approval to record as a regulatory asset for financial reporting purposes  the amounts that would otherwise be charged to aoci in stockholders equity as a result of adopting sfas no 
 which request was denied 
heco s application  filed before that decision was issued  assumed that the amounts that would otherwise be charged to aoci in stockholder s equity would be recorded as a regulatory asset for financial reporting purposes and used for ratemaking purposes 
heco s book equity financial reporting equity will be lower than that assumed in the rate increase application because of the charges to aoci as a result of recording a pension and other postretirement benefits liability after implementing sfas no 
on december  heco will propose in its rebuttal testimony to restore the book equity financial reporting equity for the amounts that were charged against equity ie  aoci in determining the equity balance for ratemaking purposes 
the authorized roace found to be fair in a rate case is applied to the equity balance in determining the utility s weighted cost of capital  which is the rate of return applied to the rate base in determining the utility s revenue requirements and rate increase in a rate case 
if the equity balance is not restored for ratemaking purposes  the utility s position is that a higher roe will be required 

table of contents helco 
in may  helco filed a request with the puc to increase base rates by million  or in annual base revenues  based on a test year  an ror  an roace and a million average rate base 
helco s application includes a proposed new tiered rate structure  which would enable most residential users to see smaller increases in the range of to 
the tiered rate structure is designed to minimize the increase for residential customers using less electricity and is expected to encourage customers to take advantage of solar water heating programs and other energy management options 
in addition  helco s application proposes new time of use service rates for residential and commercial customers 
the proposed rate increase would pay for improvements made to increase reliability  including transmission and distribution line improvements and the two generating units at the keahole power plant ct and ct  and increased o m expenses 
the application requests the continuation of helco s ecac 
helco has filed testimonies and a consultant report to address the ecac provisions of act the puc held public hearings on helco s application in june the puc granted keahole defense coalition s motion to participate in this proceeding 
in february  the consumer advocate submitted its testimony in the proceeding  recommending a revenue increase of million based on its proposed ror of  a roace ranging between and and a proposed average rate base of million 
the consumer advocate recommended adjustments of million to helco s rate base for certain costs relating to the ct and ct generating units at keahole primarily a portion of helco s afudc  land use permitting costs  and related litigation expenses 
in the filing  the consumer advocate s consultant concluded that helco s ecac provides a fair sharing of the risks of fuel cost changes between helco and its ratepayers in a manner that preserves the financial integrity of helco without the need for frequent rate filings 
keahole defense coalition which as a participant in the proceeding is limited to responding to discovery requests  filing a statement of position and responding to questions at any evidentiary hearing submitted a position statement in which it contended that the puc should exclude from rate base a greater amount of the ct and ct costs than proposed by the consumer advocate 
among the actions the consumer advocate or keahole defense coalition claim to have been imprudent were the decision to site the generation at keahole and helco s attempts to expedite the addition of generation  even though the puc  in its decision approving the commitment of expenditures for ct  found that helco had an urgent need for generation in the time frame  recognized that permitting problems might delay ct  and concluded that  in light of present and foreseeable circumstances  the location of ct at keahole was reasonable 
helco plans to submit its rebuttal to the consumer advocate s testimony and the keahole defense coalition s statement of position in march the rebuttal testimony will also propose to restore book equity financial reporting equity for the amounts that were charged against equity as of december  ie  aoci in determining the equity balance for ratemaking purposes 
the procedural schedule also includes settlement discussions and discovery of helco s rebuttal testimony prior to the evidentiary hearings scheduled in may the earliest that any increase  if granted  may go into effect is expected to be in the second quarter of meco 
in february  meco filed a request with the puc to increase base rates by million  or in annual base revenues  based on a test year  an ror  an roace and a million average rate base 
meco s application includes a proposed new tiered rate structure for residential customers to reward customers who practice energy conservation with lower electric rates for lower monthly usage 
the proposed rate increase would pay for improvements to increase reliability  including two new generating units added since meco s last rate case which was based on a test year at its maalaea power plant m  a mw combustion turbine placed in service in and m  an mw steam turbine placed in service in october to complete the installation of a second dual train combined cycle unit  and transmission and distribution infrastructure improvements 
the proposed rate structure also includes continuation of meco s ecac 
meco has filed testimonies to address the ecac provisions of act the application requests a return on meco s pension assets ie  accumulated contributions in excess of accumulated net periodic pension costs by including such assets net of deferred income taxes in rate base 
the application also proposes to restore book equity in determining the equity balance for ratemaking purposes for the amounts that were charged against equity ie  to aoci as a result of recording a pension and other postretirement benefits liability after implementing sfas no 

table of contents depreciation rates and accounting in october  heco filed an application with the puc for approval to change its depreciation rates based on a study of depreciation expense for and to change to vintage amortization accounting for selected plant accounts 
in march  heco and the consumer advocate reached an agreement  which the puc approved in september in accordance with the agreement  heco changed its depreciation rates and changed to vintage amortization accounting for selected plant accounts effective september   resulting in slightly lower depreciation in the remainder of and for future years than would have been recorded under the previous rates and method 
other regulatory matters demand side management programs 
in october  heco and the consumer advocate finalized agreements  subject to puc approval  for the continuation of heco s three commercial and industrial dsm programs and two residential dsm programs until heco s next rate case 
these agreements were in lieu of heco continuing to seek approval of new year dsm programs and provided that dsm programs to be in place after heco s next rate case would be determined as part of the case 
under the agreements  heco agreed to cap the recovery of lost margins and shareholder incentives if such recovery would cause heco to exceed its current authorized return on rate base ie the rate of return on rate base found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent rate case for heco 
heco also agreed it would not pursue the continuation of lost margins recovery and shareholder incentives through a surcharge mechanism in future rate cases 
at the time of the agreement  heco indicated to the consumer advocate that it planned to seek alternative incentive mechanisms for dsm programs in its rate case 
in november  the puc issued orders that  subject to certain reporting requirements and other conditions  approved the agreements regarding the temporary continuation of heco s five existing dsm programs until heco s next rate case 
in november  heco filed a request for a rate increase based on a test year and approval and or modification of its existing and proposed dsm programs  and associated utility incentive mechanism 
in march  the puc issued a bifurcation order separating heco s requests for approval and or modification of its existing and proposed dsm programs from the rate case proceeding based on a test year into a new ee dsm docket 
the bifurcation order allowed heco to temporarily continue  in the manner currently employed  its existing three commercial and industrial dsm programs and two residential dsm programs  until further order by the puc 
as a result of the bifurcation order in heco s rate case  heco has been continuing its existing dsm programs and cost recovery mechanisms  including the recovery of incremental program costs for its energy efficiency dsm programs through a surcharge mechanism  pending the resolution of the ee dsm docket 
following the bifurcation order  heco also continued to accrue shareholder incentives and lost margins 
in december in the ee dsm docket  heco requested puc approval  on an interim basis  for certain modifications to its existing energy efficiency dsm programs and a new interim dsm program interim dsm proposals 
heco did not request shareholder incentives and lost margins for its proposed new interim dsm program  but did so for the modifications to its existing energy efficiency programs 
in january  the consumer advocate filed comments on heco s interim dsm proposals  which generally supported the proposals  but objected to the continued recovery of shareholder incentives and lost margins for the existing energy efficiency dsm programs  as well as for the modifications 
in april  the puc issued an interim decision and order interim d o approving heco s requests to modify its existing dsm programs and implement its proposed interim dsm program 
however  the puc also ordered that heco s recovery of lost margins and shareholder incentives for its dsm programs be discontinued within days of the interim d o ie  by may   until further order by the puc 
lost margins and shareholder incentives are estimated and recorded in the year earned  and collected from ratepayers in the current year lost margins or the following year shareholder incentives 
revenues that heco had previously expected to accrue for lost margins and shareholder incentives from may  through the end of were estimated at million  or million in after tax net income 

table of contents in october  helco and meco had reached similar agreements with the consumer advocate regarding the continuation of their dsm programs and filed requests to continue their four existing dsm programs 
in november  the puc issued orders one of which was later amended that  subject to certain reporting requirements and other conditions  approved the agreements regarding the temporary continuation of helco s and meco s dsm programs until one year after the puc makes a revenue requirements determination in heco s next rate case 
under the orders  however  helco and meco were allowed to recover only lost margins and shareholder incentives accrued through the date that interim rates are established in heco s next rate case  but were permitted in the orders to request to extend the time of such accrual and recovery for up to one additional year 
based on the interim d o in the ee dsm docket  on may   helco and meco filed a request for a one year extension for the recovery of helco and meco s lost margins and shareholder incentives or until final resolution of the ee dsm docket 
on september   the consumer advocate opposed an extension beyond september  ie  one year beyond the interim rate increase in the heco rate case 
on october and   the puc issued orders that allowed helco and meco to accrue lost margins and shareholder incentives only up to september  revenues that helco and meco had previously expected to accrue for lost margins and shareholder incentives from september  through the end of were estimated at million  or million in after tax net income 
one of the conditions to the interim continuation of the dsm programs requires the utilities and the consumer advocate to review  every six months  the economic and rate impacts resulting from implementing the agreement 
in  and  none of the electric utilities exceeded their respective authorized rors 
in  only meco exceeded its authorized ror  resulting in a reduction of revenues from shareholders incentives and lost margins for meco for by million recorded in december 
in reviewing helco s ror for  the consumer advocate raised an issue regarding keahole settlement expenses and helco agreed to refund  with interest  all of the lost margins and shareholder incentives it had earned in in june  helco recorded reduced revenues of million to reflect the lost margins and shareholder incentives for that were refunded to ratepayers in august in  heco and the consumer advocate reached agreement on a residential load management program and a commercial and industrial load management program and the puc approved heco s programs 
implementation of these programs began in early the residential load management program includes a monthly electric bill credit for eligible customers who participate in the program  which allows heco to disconnect the customer s residential electric water heaters from heco s system to reduce system load when deemed necessary by heco 
the commercial and industrial load management program provides an incentive on the portion of the demand load that eligible customers allow to be controlled or interrupted by heco 
in addition  if heco interrupts the load  an incentive is paid on the kilowatthours interrupted 
on november and december   heco filed proposed modifications to its residential direct load control rdlc and commercial and industrial direct load control cidlc programs 
on december   the puc approved the rdlc program modifications 
on february   the puc issued its d o in the ee dsm docket 
in the d o  the puc authorized heco to implement its seven proposed ee dsm programs which include enhancements to its five existing programs  with certain modifications  as well as a proposed residential customer energy awareness rcea program 
in approving the ee dsm portfolio  the puc found that the ee dsm portfolio should achieve energy efficiency goals and should be implemented in a cost effective manner  and the ee dsm programs are necessary to help address heco s current reserve capacity shortfall 
in addition  the puc required that the administration of all ee dsm programs be turned over to a non utility  third party administrator  with the transition to the administrator  funded through a public benefits fund surcharge  to become effective around january the puc indicated that a new docket will be opened to select a third party administrator and to refine details of the new market structure 
unlike the ee dsm programs  load management dsm programs will continue to be administered by the utilities 
the utilities also may compete for implementation of the ee dsm programs and the rcea program and the puc did not determine any of the parameters of the eligibility of heco or its subsidiaries or the selection criteria that will be used in awarding program implementation 

table of contents the d o also provides for heco s recovery of dsm program costs and utility incentives 
with respect to cost recovery  the puc continues to permit recovery of reasonably incurred dsm implementation costs  under the integrated resource plan irp framework 
specifically  during the transition period under the current utility market structure  labor costs are to be recovered through base rates  while non labor costs will be recovered via a surcharge 
dsm utility incentives will be derived from a graduated performance based schedule of net system benefits 
in order to qualify for an incentive  the utility must meet mw and mwh reduction goals for its ee dsm programs in both the commercial and industrial  and residential sectors 
the amount of the annual incentive is capped at million for heco  and may not exceed either of the net system benefits  or utility earnings opportunities foregone by implementing dsm programs in lieu of supply side rate based investments 
negative incentives will not be imposed for underperformance 
the puc further indicated that a new docket will be opened to approve heco s periodic dsm program reports and field any of heco s requests for dsm program modifications 
the issue of decoupling sales from revenues  which had been proposed by one party to the proceeding  was deferred to a future proceeding 
avoided cost generic docket 
in may  the puc instituted a generic investigation  including all of hawaii s electric utilities  to examine the proxy method and formula used by the electric utilities to calculate their avoided energy costs and schedule q rates 
in general  schedule q rates are available to customers with cogeneration and or small power production facilities with a capacity of kwhs or less who buy sell power from to the electric utility 
the parties to the docket include the electric utilities  the consumer advocate  the dod  and representatives of existing or potential ipps 
in march  the parties entered into and filed a stipulation to resolve proceeding  which is subject to puc approval 
the parties could not reach agreement with respect to certain of the issues  which are addressed in statements of position filed in march in july  the puc ordered the parties to review and update the agreements  information and data contained in the stipulation and file such information 
on december   the parties filed an updated stipulation to resolve proceeding with the puc 
the parties agreed that avoided fuel costs will be determined using a computer production simulation model except for lanai and molokai  and agreed on certain parameters that would be used to calculate avoided costs 
the parties were not in total agreement on certain other issues which will need to be decided by the puc 
heco and it subsidiaries  the consumer advocate and dod filed a joint statement of position that they oppose retroactive compensation to wailuku river hydro for transformer losses  as proposed by mauna kea power company  inc and the hawaii agriculture research center 
integrated resource planning  requirements for additional generating capacity and adequacy of supply 
the puc issued an order in requiring the energy utilities in hawaii to develop irps  which may be approved  rejected or modified by the puc 
the goal of integrated resource planning is the identification of demand and supply side resources and the integration of these resources for meeting near and long term consumer energy needs in an efficient and reliable manner at the lowest reasonable cost 
the utilities proposed irps are planning strategies  rather than fixed courses of action  and the resources ultimately added to their systems may differ from those included in their year plans 
under the puc s irp framework  the utilities are required to submit annual evaluations of their plans including a revised five year program implementation schedule and to submit new plans on a three year cycle  subject to changes approved by the puc 
prior to proceeding with the dsm programs  separate puc approval proceedings must be completed 
the utilities are entitled to recover all appropriate and reasonable integrated resource planning and implementation costs  including the costs of dsm programs  either through a surcharge or through their base rates 
under procedural schedules for the irp cost proceedings  the utilities can begin recovering their incremental irp costs in the month following the filing of their actual costs incurred for the year  subject to refund with interest pending the puc s final d o approving recovery in the docket for each year s costs 
helco and heco now recover irp costs through base rates and meco continues to recover its costs through a surcharge 
in december  the puc issued a d o allowing recovery of all but  of the million of irp costs the utilities incurred in and  in february  issued a d o allowing recovery of all but  of the million of irp costs the utilities incurred in however  the consumer advocate has objected to the recovery of million before interest of the million of incremental irp costs incurred by the utilities during the period  and the puc s decision is pending on these costs 
in addition  meco incurred approximately million of incremental irp costs for  for which the consumer advocate has not yet stated its position 
as 
table of contents of december   the amount of revenues  including interest and revenue taxes  that the electric utilities recorded in through for irp cost recoveries  subject to refund with interest  amounted to million 
see demand side management programs above  which includes a discussion of the agreements between the utilities and the consumer advocate concerning prior caps on the recovery of lost margins and shareholders incentives 
heco s irp 
in october  heco filed its third irp irp  which proposes multiple solutions to meet oahu s future energy needs  including renewable energy resources  energy efficiency  conservation  technology such as chp and dg and central station generation including a combustion turbine generating unit in described under heco s campbell industrial park generating unit and a possible mw coal unit in 
in addition  heco currently plans for all existing generating units to remain in operation future environmental considerations permitting beyond the year irp planning period 
in june  the puc granted an environmental group s motion to intervene in the proceeding and ordered the parties to determine the issues  procedures and schedule for the docket and to file a stipulated procedural order 
in september  the parties to the irp docket filed for puc approval a stipulation for the parties to meet informally to address irp process issues and to attempt to reach a follow up stipulation that will allow for the disposition of the irp docket without a final d o approving the irp plan and action plan 
if the parties are unable to reach a follow up stipulation  then the parties will file a stipulated procedural order setting forth the issues  procedures and schedule for the docket  or if the parties are unable to reach agreement on a stipulated procedural order  then the parties will submit separate proposed procedural orders for puc consideration 
helco s irp 
in september  helco filed its second irp with the puc  and updated it in and on the supply side  helco s second irp focused on the planning for generating unit additions after near term additions 
the near term additions included installing two mw cts at its keahole power plant site which were put into limited commercial operation in may and june and a power purchase agreement ppa with hamakua energy partners  lp hep for a mw net facility which was completed in december 
helco has deferred the retirements of some of its older generating units until the timeframe  and periodically assesses the cost effectiveness of the continued operation of those units 
helco s current plans are to install an mw heat recovery steam generator st in or earlier 
after the installation of st  the target date in helco s updated second irp for the next firm capacity addition is the timeframe 
helco was to have filed its third irp with the puc by december   but requested an extension of the filing date to no later than may  and is awaiting a ruling on this request 
meco s irp 
meco filed its second irp with the puc in may  and updated it in and on the supply side  meco s second irp focused on the planning for the installation of approximately mw of additional generation through the year on the island of maui  including mw of generation at its maalaea power plant site in increments from  mw at its new waena site in increments from  beginning with a mw combustion turbine in currently not planned to be added until  and mw from the acquisition of a wind resource in meco actually first began to purchase wind energy in from kaheawa wind power  llc of mw  not mw 
approximately mw of additional generation through the year were included for each of the islands of lanai and molokai 
meco completed the installation of a mw increment the second at maalaea in september  and the final increment of mw  which was originally expected to be installed in  went into commercial operation in october meco s third irp is required to be filed with the puc by april  heco s campbell industrial park generating unit 
in june  heco filed with the puc an application for approval of funds to build a new mw simple cycle combustion turbine ct generating unit at campbell industrial park and an additional kilovolt transmission line to transmit power from generating units at campbell industrial park including the new unit to the rest of the oahu electric grid collectively  the project 
plans are for the combustion turbine to be run primarily as a peaking unit beginning in  fueled by biofuels  but with the capability of using diesel or naphtha 
on december   heco signed a contract with siemens to purchase a mw combustion turbine unit 
the contract allows heco to terminate the contract at a specified payment amount if necessary ct project approvals are not obtained 

table of contents the puc granted an environmental group s motion to intervene 
in july  the honolulu city council adopted a resolution to amend the public infrastructure map to include the new generating facility at campbell industrial park 
heco s final environmental impact statement for the project was accepted by the department of planning permitting of the city and county of honolulu in august in december  heco filed with the puc an agreement with the consumer advocate in which heco committed to use biofuels in its new plant and the steps necessary for heco to reach that goal 
after agreeing to use biofuels in its new plant  there were no remaining differences between heco and the consumer advocate regarding the issues in the docket 
the environmental group agreed that there is a need for additional generation on oahu  but disagreed on the use of the proposed ct unit and the use of biofuels 
hearings were held in december opening and reply briefs are due in march and a puc decision is expected to follow 
preliminary costs for the project are estimated at million 
as of december   accumulated project costs for planning  engineering  permitting and afudc amounted to million 
in conjunction with the project  in december  heco issued a request for proposals for suppliers of ethanol or biodiesel meeting heco s specifications for the new unit 
the puc would need to approve any resulting ethanol or biodiesel fuel supply contract 
in a related application filed with the puc in june  heco requested approval for part of the package of community benefit measures  which is currently estimated at million through the first years of implementation  to mitigate the impact of the new generating unit on communities near the proposed generating unit site 
these measures include a base electric rate discount for heco s residential customers who live near the proposed generation site  additional air quality monitoring stations  a fish monitoring program and the use of recycled instead of potable water for industrial water consumption at the kahe power plant 
for the community benefits application  the only party to the proceeding is the consumer advocate  and a hearing was held in november the primary issue during the hearing was whether rate recovery of foregone revenues from the proposed electric rate discount program is just and reasonable 
the consumer advocate did not object to the remainder of the community benefit package 
briefs were filed in january and a puc decision is pending 
adequacy of supply 
heco 
heco s adequacy of supply aos letter  filed in february  indicates that heco s analysis estimates the reserve capacity shortfall to be approximately mw in the to period before the addition of the campbell industrial park combustion turbine estimated to be installed in  which is significantly smaller than the to mw shortfall in the to period projected in the aos letter 
while the decrease in the projected reserve capacity shortfall is due to a combination of factors  the primary factor is the significantly lower sales and peak forecast issued in august resulting in a reduction in peak demand used in aos analyses of approximately mw in the to period 
among other factors contributing to the reduction is a small improvement in the expectation of overall availability for existing generating units in future years 
the small improvement projected in overall generating unit availability is based on the most recent operating experience in during which there was some improvement over in unit availability 
however  the availability rates for heco units have generally declined since and based on this experience  the manner in which the units must be operated when there is a reserve capacity shortfall  and the increasing ages of the units  heco expects availability rates to remain suppressed in the near term 
although the availability rates for generating units on oahu continue to be better than those of comparable units on the us mainland  heco generating units may continue to be entirely or partially unavailable to serve load during scheduled overhaul periods and other planned maintenance outages  or when they trip or are taken out of operation or their output is de rated due to equipment failure or other causes 
to mitigate the projected reserve capacity shortfalls  heco is continuing to plan and implement mitigation measures  such as installing distributed generators at substations or other sites  implementing additional load management and other demand reduction measures  and pursuing efforts to improve the availability of generating units 
heco will operate at lower than desired reliability levels and take steps to mitigate the reserve capacity shortfall situation until the next generating unit is installed 
until sufficient generating capacity can be added to the system  heco will experience a higher risk of generation related customer outages 

table of contents after the planned addition of the campbell industrial park generating unit  and in recognition of the uncertainty underlying key forecasts  heco anticipates the potential for continued reserve capacity shortfalls  which could range between mw to mw in the to period 
any plan to install additional firm capacity is required to proceed under the guidance of the competitive bidding framework issued by the puc in december heco s gross peak demand was  mw in   mw in and  mw in the gross peak demand of  mw in was mw higher than the projected peak for although the gross peak demand in and was lower than in  demand for electricity on oahu is projected to increase 
in october  november  january  june and february  heco issued public requests that its customers voluntarily conserve electricity as generating units were out for scheduled maintenance or were unexpectedly unavailable 
in addition to making the requests  in november  january  june and february  heco remotely turned off water heaters for a number of residential customers who participate in its energy scout load control program 
also  see recent outages below 
helco 
helco s adequacy of supply letter filed in january indicated that helco s generation capacity for the next three years  through  is sufficiently large to meet all reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies 
also  see recent outages below 
meco 
in december  meco s maalaea unit  a diesel generator  suffered an equipment failure and the unit is not expected to be available for service until approximately july in february  meco filed its adequacy of supply letter  which indicated that meco s maui island system should usually have sufficient installed capacity to meet the forecasted loads 
however  in the event of an unexpected outage of the largest unit  the maui island system may not have sufficient capacity until maalaea unit  with a mw capacity  returns to service 
to overcome insufficient reserve capacity situations  meco has been implementing appropriate mitigation measures  such as optimizing its unit overhaul schedule to minimize load capability shortfalls  coordinating the delivery of supplemental power  as needed  from an ipp and modifying its combined cycle unit overhaul procedure to allow for the possible operation of the combustion turbine in simple cycle mode 
in october  meco placed into commercial operation an additional mw of capacity at its maalaea power plant site 
in april and august  meco experienced lower than normal generation capacity due to the unexpected temporary loss of several of its generating units  and issued a public request that its customers voluntarily conserve electricity 
also  see recent outages below 
recent outages 
heco s system peak loads generally occur in the fourth quarter of the year  but generation shortfall events may occur at any time during the year 
on june   due to the unanticipated loss of three generating units from an ipp and two heco generating units  heco shed power to  customers in various parts of the island 
power was restored to all customers within four hours 
on sunday  october   shortly after am  two earthquakes centered on the island of hawaii with magnitudes of and triggered power outages throughout most of the state and disrupted air traffic on all major islands 
on oahu  following the impact of the earthquakes  a series of protective actions and automatic systems operated to successively shut down all generators to protect them from potential damage 
as a result  no significant damage to any of heco s generators  or transmission and distribution systems  occurred 
following the island wide outage  heco restored power to customers in a careful  methodical manner to further protect its system  and as a result power was restored to over of its customers over a period of time ranging from approximately to hours 
management believes the shutdown and methodical restoration of power were necessary to prevent severe damage to heco s generating equipment and power grid and to avoid a more prolonged blackout 

table of contents helco s and meco s smaller electric systems also experienced sustained outages from the earthquakes  however  their systems were for the most part back online by mid to late afternoon 
as is the electric utilities practice with all major system emergencies  management immediately committed to investigating the outage  including bringing in an outside industry expert to help identify any potential improvements to procedures or systems  and also made arrangements for a preliminary briefing of the puc 
the puc briefings took place on october and  heco also conducted a public briefing on october  heco has made it clear that in addition to any investigation it undertakes  it will cooperate fully with any other reviews conducted by its regulators 
following requests by members of a state senate energy subcommittee and the consumer advocate that the puc investigate the power failure  to which investigation heco stated it did not object  the puc issued an order on october  opening an investigative proceeding on the outages at heco  helco and meco on october and  the preliminary questions the puc has asked to be addressed in the proceeding include aside from the earthquake  are there any underlying causes that contributed or may have contributed to the power outages  were the actions of the electric utilities prior to and during the power outages reasonable and in the public interest  and were the power restoration processes and communication regarding the outages reasonable and timely under the circumstances  could the island wide power outages on oahu and maui have been avoided  and what are the necessary steps to minimize and improve the response to such occurrences in the future  and what penalties  if any  should be imposed on the electric utilities 
pursuant to the puc s order  heco s outage report was filed in december  and the outage reports of helco and meco must be filed by march  the investigation consultants retained by heco  power engineers  inc  concluded that  heco s performance prior to and during the outage demonstrated reasonable actions in the public interest in a distinctly extraordinary event 
the consultants also made a number of recommendations  mostly of a technical nature  regarding the operation of the electric system during such an incident 
management cannot predict the outcome of the investigation or its impacts on the utilities 
management is currently evaluating additional impacts the earthquakes and outages had and may have on the utilities eg  property damage and claims 
collective bargaining agreements each of the electric utilities entered into a four year collective bargaining agreement in with the union which represents approximately of electric utility employees 
see collective bargaining agreements in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
legislation and regulation congress and the hawaii legislature periodically consider legislation that could have positive or negative effects on the utilities and their customers 
energy policy act of on august   the president signed into law the energy policy act of the act 
the act provides billion in tax incentives over a year period designed to boost conservation efforts  increase domestic energy production and expand the use of alternative energy sources  such as solar  wind  ethanol  biomass  hydropower and clean coal technology 
ocean energy sources  including wave power  are identified as renewable technologies 
section of the act authorizes a study by the us department of energy of hawaii s dependence on oil  however  that provision is subject to appropriation  as is million authorized under section for a sugar cane ethanol program in hawaii 
incentives also include tax credits and shorter depreciable lives for many assets associated with energy production and transmission 
the act s primary direct impact on heco and its subsidiaries is currently expected to be the reduction in the depreciable tax life  from years to years  of certain electric transmission equipment placed into service after april  public utility holding company act of act and public utility holding company act of act 
the repeal of the act  effective february   eliminates significant federal restrictions on the scope  structure and ownership of electric utilities 
some believe that the repeal will result in increased institutional ownership of and private equity and hedge fund investments in public utilities  increased consolidation in the industry  more federal energy regulatory commission ferc oversight  and additional diversification by electric utilities 
the increased oversight by ferc results in part from the adoption of the act  which provides for ferc access to the books and records of utility holding companies and  absent exemptions or waivers  imposes 
table of contents certain record retention and accounting requirements on public utility holding companies 
hei and heco filed a notification claiming a waiver of such requirements as single state public utility holding companies 
a written notice dated may  was received from ferc confirming the effectiveness of the hei and heco waivers 
regulation and oversight of heco and its subsidiaries by the puc  however  remains unchanged 
renewable portfolio standard 
the hawaii legislature amended an existing renewable portfolio standard rps law to require electric utilities to meet a renewable portfolio standard of of kwh sales by december   by december   by december   and by december  these standards may be met by the electric utilities on an aggregated basis and were met in when they attained a rps of 
it may be difficult  however  for the electric utilities to attain the required renewables percentages in the future  and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so including potential penalties to be established by the puc 
the rps law was further amended in to provide that at least of the rps targets must be met by electrical energy generated using renewable energy sources  such as wind or solar  versus from the electrical energy savings from renewable energy displacement technologies such as solar water heating or from energy efficiency and conservation programs 
the amendment also added provisions for penalties to be established by the puc if the rps requirements are not met and criteria for waiver of the penalties by the puc  if the requirements cannot be met due to circumstances beyond the electric utility s control 
the puc must  by december   develop and implement a utility ratemaking structure  which may include  but is not limited to  performance based ratemaking pbr  to provide incentives that encourage hawaii s electric utility companies to use cost effective renewable energy resources found in hawaii to meet the rps  while allowing for deviation from the standards in the event that the standards cannot be met in a cost effective manner  or as a result of circumstances beyond the control of the utility which could not have been reasonably anticipated or ameliorated 
on january   the puc opened a new docket rps docket to examine hawaii s amended rps law  to establish the appropriate penalties and to determine circumstances under which penalties should be levied 
the puc indicated that the amendment to the rps law that added provisions for penalties effectively gives utilities incentive to comply with rps and therefore the puc will no longer complete the rulemaking in a process initiated in november  but will instead proceed by way of this rps docket to handle any issues related to the utilities meeting renewable portfolio standards 
management cannot predict the outcome of this process 
see renewable energy strategy below 
net energy metering 
hawaii has a net energy metering law  which requires that electric utilities offer net energy metering to eligible customer generators ie  a customer generator may be a net user or supplier of energy and will make payment to or receive credit from the electric utility accordingly 
the law provides a cap of of the electric utility s peak demand on the total generating capacity produced by eligible customer generators 
the legislature amended the net energy metering law by expanding the definition of eligible customer generator to include government entities  increasing the maximum size of eligible net metered systems from kilowatts kw to kw and limiting exemptions from additional requirements for systems meeting safety and performance standards to systems of kw or less 
in  the legislature again amended the net energy metering law by  among other revisions  authorizing the puc  by rule or order  to increase the maximum size of the eligible net metered systems and to increase the total rated generating capacity available for net energy metering 
in april  the puc initiated an investigative proceeding on whether the puc should increase the maximum capacity of eligible customer generators to more than kw and the total rated generating capacity produced by eligible customer generators to an amount above of an electric utility s system peak demand 
the parties to the proceeding include heco  helco  meco  kauai island utility cooperative  a renewable energy organization and a solar vendor organization 
the puc has approved a procedural schedule with panel hearings scheduled for october depending on their magnitude  changes made by the puc by rule or order could have a negative effect on electric utility sales 
management cannot predict the outcome of the investigative proceeding 
dsm programs 
in  the puc was given the authority  if it deems appropriate  to redirect all or a portion of the funds currently collected by the utilities and included in their revenues through the current utility dsm surcharge into 
table of contents a public benefits fund  for the purpose of supporting customer dsm programs approved by the puc 
if the fund is established  the puc is required to appoint a fund administrator other than an electric utility or utility affiliate to operate and manage the programs established under the fund 
non fossil fuel purchased power contracts 
in connection with the puc s determination of just and reasonable rates in purchased power contracts  the puc will be required to establish a methodology that removes or significantly reduces any linkage between the price paid for non fossil fuel generated electricity under future power purchase contracts and the price of fossil fuel  in order to allow utility customers to receive the potential cost savings from non fossil fuel generation 
other legislation 
a number of bills were introduced in the hawaii state legislative session 
the majority of the measures contained in these bills do not negatively affect the electric utilities  and the electric utilities support many of the measures that would encourage the more efficient use of energy and the use of hawaii s renewable resources 
various bills also propose different approaches to addressing the issue of global warming 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the deliberations on any proposed legislation 
for a discussion of environmental legislation and regulations  see certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition consolidated environmental matters below 
other developments advanced meter infrastructure ami 
heco is evaluating the feasibility of utility applications using power line and wireless technologies for two way communication 
heco is currently partnering with sensus metering systems to field test an advanced metering infrastructure system that delivers hourly meter reads  which can enable time of use pricing options for heco customers 
this pilot is expected to include more than  residential  commercial and industrial customers 
other utility applications being evaluated include distribution system line monitoring  residential direct load control and monitoring of distribution substation equipment 
earthlink  an internet service provider  has partnered with the city and county of honolulu in a pilot agreement to test providing free  wireless  broadband access in chinatown in downtown honolulu 
as part of that chinatown pilot project  heco hopes to negotiate a separate non binding collaborative agreement with earthlink to develop and demonstrate a variety of utility applications using wifi technology  including advanced electric metering and energy conservation initiatives 
in october  the federal communications commission fcc released a report and order that amended and adopted new rules for access broadband over power line systems access bpl and stated that an fcc goal in developing the rules for access bpl are therefore to provide a framework that will both facilitate the rapid introduction and development of bpl systems and protect licensed radio services from harmful interference 
currently  there are no puc regulations for electric utility applications of bpl systems 
heco completed a small scale trial of the broadband over power line bpl technology in based on the favorable results of the trial  heco proceeded with a small scale pilot in an expanded residential commercial area in honolulu  which ended in late that effort was primarily focused on automatic meter reading  which is aimed at enabling time of use rates for residential and commercial customers 
no further bpl pilots are anticipated at this time 
renewable energy strategy 
the electric utilities continue to pursue the following three pronged renewable energy strategy a promote the development of cost effective  commercially viable renewable energy projects  b facilitate the integration of intermittent renewable energy resources and c encourage renewable energy research  development and demonstration projects eg  photovoltaic energy and the electronic shock absorber esa for wind generation 
they are also conducting integrated resource planning to evaluate the increased use of renewables within the electric utilities service territories 
the electric utilities support renewable energy through their solar water heating and heat pump programs and the negotiation and execution of purchased power contracts with nonutility generators using renewable sources eg  refuse fired  geothermal  hydroelectric and wind turbine generating systems 
heco received a us patent in february for an esa that addresses power fluctuations from wind resources 
an esa demonstration system was installed and tested at helco s lalamilo wind farm 
heco has an intellectual property license agreement with s c electric company s c  the party constructing the esa 
table of contents demonstration system 
s c has the right to seek international patents for the design 
on october   the esa demonstration system sustained structural and fire damage and is no longer operational 
however  the impact of the loss on the electric utilities financial statements is immaterial 
in addition  the demonstration confirmed the viability of the technology on a small scale wind farm  and management plans to pursue a larger scale project in the future 
management cannot predict the amount of royalties heco may receive from the sale of esas in the future 
in december  heco formed an unregulated subsidiary  rhi  with initial approval to invest up to million in selected renewable energy projects 
rhi is seeking to stimulate renewable energy initiatives by prospecting for new projects and sites and taking a passive  minority interest in third party renewable energy projects greater than mw in hawaii 
since  rhi has periodically solicited competitive proposals for investment opportunities in qualified projects 
to date  rhi has signed a conditional investment agreement for a small scale landfill gas to energy project on oahu  a framework agreement for evaluation of three wind projects and two pumped storage hydroelectric projects and two project agreements providing the option to invest in wind projects 
project investments by rhi will generally be made only after developers secure the necessary approvals and permits and independently execute a ppa with heco  helco or meco  approved by the puc 
in february  blueearth biofuels llc blueearth announced plans for a new biodiesel refining plant to be built on the island of maui by the biodiesel plant will be owned by blueearth maui biofuels llc blueearth maui  a planned new venture between blueearth and a to be formed non regulated subsidiary of heco 
all of the heco non regulated subsidiary s profits from the project will be directed into a biofuels public trust to be created for the purpose of funding biofuels development in hawaii 
meco intends to lease to the non regulated subsidiary of heco a portion of the land owned by meco for its future waena generation station as the site for the biodiesel plant  with lease proceeds to be credited to meco ratepayers 
in addition  meco plans to negotiate a fuel purchase contract with blueearth maui for biodiesel to be used in existing diesel fired units at meco s maalaea plant 
both the lease agreement and biodiesel fuel contract will require puc approval 
liquidity and capital resources heco s consolidated capital structure was as follows december dollars in millions short term borrowings long term debt  net preferred stock common stock equity includes aoci charge for retirement benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
as of december  as of february   the standard poor s s p and moody s investors service s moody s ratings of heco securities were as follows s p moody s commercial paper a p revenue bonds senior unsecured  insured aaa aaa heco obligated preferred securities of trust subsidiary bbb baa cumulative preferred stock selected series not rated baa the above ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold any securities  such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
heco s overall s p corporate credit rating is bbb negative a the rating agencies use a combination of qualitative measures ie  assessment of business risk that incorporates an analysis of the qualitative factors such as management  competitive positioning  operations  markets and regulation as well as quantitative measures eg  cash flow  debt  interest coverage and liquidity ratios in determining the ratings of heco securities 
in november  s p confirmed its corporate credit ratings of heco and maintained its negative outlook 
s p s ratings outlook assesses the potential direction of a long term credit rating over the intermediate term typically six months to two years 
s p indicated 
table of contents failure to strengthen key financial parameters  especially cash flow coverage of debt  a slump in the hawaiian economy  a punitive final rate order  


could lead to lower ratings 
conversely  credit supportive actions by the company as well as responsive rate treatment would lead to ratings stability 
in addition  s p ranks business profiles from strong to weak 
in november  s p did not change heco s business profile rank of in december  moody s confirmed its issuer ratings and stable outlook for heco 
moody s stated  the rating could be downgraded should weaker than expected regulatory support emerge  including the continuation of regulatory lag  which ultimately causes earnings and sustainable cash flow to suffer 
heco utilizes short term debt  principally commercial paper  to support normal operations and for other temporary requirements 
heco also periodically borrows short term from hei for itself and on behalf of helco and meco  and heco may borrow from or loan to helco and meco short term 
the intercompany borrowings among the utilities  but not the borrowings from hei  are eliminated in the consolidation of heco s financial statements 
at december   helco and meco had million and million  respectively  of short term borrowings from heco 
heco had an average outstanding balance of commercial paper for of million and had million of commercial paper outstanding as of december  management believes that if heco s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded  it may be more difficult for heco to sell commercial paper under current market conditions 
effective april   heco entered into a revolving unsecured credit agreement establishing a line of credit facility of million with a syndicate of eight financial institutions 
the agreement has an initial term which expires on march  on august   heco filed an application with the puc requesting approval to maintain the million credit facility for five years  which  if approved by the puc  will automatically extend the termination date of the credit facility from march  to march  see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the million credit facility 
as of december   the line was undrawn 
in the future  the electric utilities may seek to enter into new lines of credit and may also seek to increase the amount of credit available under such lines as management deems appropriate 
operating activities provided million in net cash during investing activities used net cash of million  primarily for capital expenditures  net of contributions in aid of construction 
financing activities used net cash of million  including a million net decrease in short term borrowings and million for the payment of common and preferred stock dividends 
in order to strengthen heco s balance sheet and support its investment in its reliability program  heco did not pay any dividends to hei in the second half of in may  the hawaii legislature authorized the issuance  prior to june   of up to million of special purpose revenue bonds sprbs million for heco  million for helco and million for meco  subject to puc approval of the projects to be financed  to finance the electric utilities capital improvement projects 
the puc must approve issuances of long term securities for heco  helco and meco  including notes or debentures issued by the electric utilities in connection with the issuance of sprbs  taxable unsecured notes or trust preferred securities 
in december  an application was filed with the puc requesting approval to issue up to a total of million in taxable unsecured notes for heco  meco and helco up to million for heco  up to million for helco and up to million for meco 
on january   a registration statement on form s was filed with the sec for unsecured taxable notes to be issued by each of the electric utilities 
however  on october   the electric utilities amended the puc application  in accordance with a stipulation between the utilities and the consumer advocate  to seek approval for the issuance of up to million of sprbs allocated as indicated above instead of issuing the taxable unsecured notes 
accordingly  the electric utilities have withdrawn the registration statement on form s and currently contemplate issuing up to million of sprbs in march in september  the electric utilities filed an application with the puc seeking authority to participate with the department of budget and finance of the state of hawaii in the issuance of refunding sprbs  with the proceeds of such bonds  if issued  to be used to redeem the series a sprbs and or the series b sprbs  which are currently callable 
in december  the puc granted the approvals necessary to issue the refunding bonds 
the decision whether and  if so  when to issue refunding sprbs and or to call the series 
table of contents a and or the series b sprbs will depend on future market conditions and contractual and other considerations 
for the five year period through  the utility forecasts billion of gross capital expenditures  approximately of which is for transmission and distribution projects and for generation projects  with the remaining for general plant and other projects 
these estimates do not include expenditures  which could be material  that would be required to comply with cooling water intake structure regulations adopted by the epa in or the july regional haze rule amendments 
see environmental regulation in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the electric utilities net capital expenditures which exclude afudc and capital expenditures funded by third party contributions in aid of construction for through are currently estimated to total approximately billion 
heco s consolidated cash flows from operating activities net income  adjusted for non cash income and expense items such as depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes  after the payment of common stock and preferred stock dividends  are currently not expected to provide sufficient cash to cover the forecast net capital expenditures and to reduce the level of short term borrowings  which level is expected to fluctuate during this forecast period 
long term debt financing is expected to be required to fund this estimated shortfall as well as any unanticipated expenditures not included in the through forecast  such as increases in the costs of  or acceleration of  the construction of capital projects  capital expenditures that may be required by new environmental laws and regulations  unbudgeted acquisitions or investments in new businesses  significant increases in retirement benefit funding requirements and higher tax payments that would result if tax positions taken by the utilities do not prevail 
proceeds from the anticipated issuance of revenue bonds  cash flows from operating activities and temporary increases in short term borrowings are expected to provide the forecast million needed for the net capital expenditures in for  gross capital expenditures are estimated to be million  including approximately million for transmission and distribution projects  approximately million for generation projects and approximately million for general plant and other projects 
consolidated net capital expenditures for heco and subsidiaries for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
funding for the electric utilities qualified pension plans is based upon actuarially determined contributions that consider the amount deductible for income tax purposes and the funding requirements under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
although the electric utilities were not required to make any contributions to the qualified pension plans to meet minimum funding requirements pursuant to erisa for  and  they made voluntary contributions in and with respect to the postretirement benefit plans  the electric utilities policy is to comply with directives from the puc to fund the costs 
contributions by the electric utilities to the retirement benefit plans for  and totaled million  million and million  respectively  and are expected to total million in additional contributions to the retirement benefit plans may be required  or may be made even if not required  and such contributions could be in amounts substantially in excess of the amounts currently included in the electric utilities forecast of their consolidated financing requirements for the period through sfas no 
 which was adopted on december   does not impact the calculations of retirement benefit costs 
management periodically reviews capital expenditure estimates and the timing of construction projects 
these estimates may change significantly as a result of many considerations  including changes in economic conditions  changes in forecasts of kwh sales and peak load  the availability of purchased power and changes in expectations concerning the construction and ownership of future generating units  the availability of generating sites and transmission and distribution corridors  the ability to obtain adequate and timely rate increases  escalation in construction costs  the impacts of dsm programs and combined heat and power installations  the effects of opposition to proposed construction projects and requirements of environmental and other regulatory and permitting authorities 

table of contents bank executive overview and strategy when asb was acquired by hei in  it was a traditional thrift with assets of billion and net income of about million 
asb has grown by both acquisition and internal growth since and ended with assets of billion and net income of million  compared to assets of billion as of december  and net income of million in the interest rate environment  the quality of asb s assets  and the strategic transformation of asb from a traditional thrift to a community bank have impacted and will continue to impact its financial results 
asb has been facing a challenging interest rate environment that has pressured its net interest margin 
the federal reserve bank s rate increases since mid have led to higher short term interest rates  while  during the same period  long term interest rates have remained low  resulting in an inverted yield curve throughout the second half of the higher short term interest rates have put upward pressure on deposit rates  while the low long term interest rates have held down asset yields  putting downward pressure on net interest margin 
if the current interest rate environment persists  the potential for compression of asb s margin will continue to be a concern 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  asb uses simulation analysis to measure net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
asb then employs strategies to limit the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
asb s key strategies include attracting and retaining low cost deposits  which enables asb to replace other borrowings and reduce funding costs  diversifying its loan portfolio with higher yielding  shorter maturity loans or variable rate loans such as commercial  commercial real estate and consumer loans  which also creates a more diversified income stream for the bank  investing in mortgage related securities with short average lives  and managing costing liabilities to optimize cost of funds and manage interest rate sensitivity 
asb s asset quality remained strong in as a result of continued strength in the hawaii economy and the real estate market 
however  asb recorded a provision for loan losses of million after tax during  primarily due to a single commercial loan  compared to a million after tax reversal of allowance for loan losses during asb s allowance as a percentage of average loans was at the end of  compared to and at the end of and  respectively 
this ratio falls between the benchmark ratios for national banks and thrifts  which is as expected because asb s large residential mortgage portfolio is typical of a thrift and asb has added commercial and commercial real estate loans typical of commercial banks 
the allowance is adjusted continuously through the provision for loan losses to reflect factors such as charge offs  outstanding loan balances  loan grading  external factors affecting the national and hawaii economy  specific industries and sectors and interest rates  and historical and estimated loan losses 
asb is a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers 
in order to remain competitive and continue building core franchise value  the bank continues to develop and introduce new products and services in order to meet the needs of those markets 
additionally  the banking industry is constantly changing and asb is making the investments in people and technology necessary to adapt and remain competitive 
asb s ongoing challenge is to increase revenues faster than expenses

the following table presents a reconciliation of asb s net income to net income excluding the million charge in management believes the adjusted information below presents asb s net income on a more comparable basis for the periods shown

taking into account the adjustments in the table above  asb s net income would have increased compared to 
table of contents bank operations earnings of asb depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on costing liabilities 
as discussed above  if the current interest rate environment persists  compression of asb s net interest margin will continue to be a concern 
asb s loan volumes and yields are affected by market interest rates  competition  demand for financing  availability of funds and management s responses to these factors

deposits continue to be the largest source of funds for asb and are affected by market interest rates  competition and management s responses to these factors 
advances from the fhlb of seattle and securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be significant sources of funds  but the amount of advances has trended downward over the last few years 
as of december   asb s costing liabilities consisted of deposits and other borrowings  comparable to december  however  in  higher short term interest rates and the inverted yield curve made it challenging to retain deposits and control funding costs 
asb experienced net deposit outflows in the middle of  and management acted in response with a combination of tactical repricings of deposits  promotions and the introduction of new products and services 
the shift in deposit mix from lower cost savings and checking accounts to higher cost certificates  along with the repricing of deposits  has contributed to increased funding costs 
deposits as of december  were essentially flat compared to deposits as of december  deposit retention and growth  however  will remain a challenge in the current environment 
other factors primarily affecting asb s operating results include fee income  provision or reversal of allowance for loan losses  gains or losses on sales of securities available for sale and expenses from operations 
although higher long term interest rates could reduce the market value of mortgage related securities and reduce stockholder s equity through a balance sheet charge to aoci  this reduction in the market value of mortgage related securities would not result in a charge to net income in the absence of an other than temporary impairment in the value of the securities 
as of december  and  the unrealized losses  net of tax benefits  on available for sale investment and mortgage related securities including securities pledged for repurchase agreements in aoci was million and million  respectively

net interest income before provision for loan losses for decreased by million  or  when compared to as the challenging interest rate environment pressured asb s net interest margin 
continued growth in average loans and deposits partially offset margin compression pressure from a flattening yield curve  which was inverted throughout the second half of net interest margin decreased from in to in as the impact of growth in the loan portfolio and higher yields in the loan and mortgage related securities portfolios was more than offset by increased funding costs 
the increase in the average loan portfolio balance was helped by the continued strength in the hawaii economy and real estate market 
the decrease in the average investment and mortgage related securities portfolios was due to the use of the proceeds from repayments in the portfolios to fund loans 
increased average deposit balances enabled asb to replace other borrowings 

table of contents asb s asset quality remained strong due to continued strength in real estate and business conditions  which resulted in low historical loss ratios and low net charge offs for asb 
however  a provision for loan losses of million million  net of tax was recorded in  primarily due to a single commercial loan  but management does not believe that the adverse development of this loan is reflective of a trend in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio 
this compares with a reversal of allowance for loan losses of million million  net of tax in noninterest income for increased by million over due to higher fee income on deposit liabilities and gains on sales of securities  partially offset by lower income from the sale of investment and insurance products 
noninterest expense for increased by million over primarily due to higher legal and litigation related expenses and occupancy expenses 
net interest income before reversal of allowance for loan losses for increased by million  or  when compared to strong organic growth in loans and deposits and the ability to keep deposit cost low enabled asb to offset margin compression pressure from a flattening yield curve  which inverted near year end 
net interest margin increased from in to in due to growth in the loan portfolio and higher yields in the loan and mortgage related securities portfolios funded by strong deposit growth 
the increase in the average loan portfolio balance was due in part to the continued strength in the hawaii economy and real estate market 
the decrease in the average investment and mortgage related securities portfolios was due to the reinvestment of excess liquidity into loans 
average deposit balances grew by million  enabling asb to replace other borrowings and helping fund loan growth 
the shift in liability mix enabled asb to keep down its weighted average rate on costing liabilities 
due to considerable strength in real estate and business conditions  which resulted in lower historical loss ratios and lower net charge offs for asb  and other factors discussed above  asb recorded a reversal of allowance for loan losses of million million  net of tax in  which was less than the reversal of allowance for loan losses of million million  net of tax in noninterest income remained stable for when compared to noninterest expense for increased by million  or  over  primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense related to strategic initiatives  increased pension costs  sarbanes oxley act of sox compliance costs and the charge for prepayment of a high cost federal home loan bank advance

fhlb of seattle business and capital plan in december  the fhlb of seattle signed an agreement with its regulator  the federal housing finance board finance board  to adopt a business and capital plan to strengthen its risk management  capital structure and governance 
in april  the fhlb of seattle delivered a proposed three year business plan and capital management plan to the finance board  and issued a press release stating that it anticipates minimal to no dividends in the next few years while it implements its new business model 
no dividends were received by asb from the fhlb of seattle during the fourth quarter of  the last three quarters of and the first three quarters of in december  the board of directors of the fhlb of seattle declared  and asb received  a cash dividend of  in december in january  the fhlb of seattle announced that the finance board had terminated its agreement with the fhlb of seattle  attributing the termination to its full compliance with the terms of the agreement and significant progress the fhlb of seattle has made in implementing its business and capital management plan 

table of contents legislation and regulation asb is subject to extensive regulation  principally by the office of thrift supervision ots and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
depending on its level of regulatory capital and other considerations  these regulations could restrict the ability of asb to compete with other institutions and to pay dividends to its shareholders 
see the discussions below under liquidity and capital resources and certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition bank 
liquidity and capital resources december change change dollars in millions assets available for sale investment and mortgage related securities investment in stock of federal home loan bank of seattle loans receivable  net deposit liabilities other bank borrowings as of december   asb was the third largest financial institution in hawaii based on assets of billion and deposits of billion 
asb s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits  borrowings  the maturity and repayment of portfolio loans and securities and the sale of loans into secondary market channels 
asb s deposits as of december  were million higher than december  asb s principal sources of borrowings are advances from the fhlb and securities sold under agreements to repurchase from broker dealers 
as of december   fhlb borrowings totaled approximately billion  representing of assets 
asb is approved to borrow from the fhlb up to of asb s assets to the extent it provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient fhlb stock 
as of december   asb s unused fhlb borrowing capacity was approximately billion 
as of december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled billion  representing of assets 
asb utilizes deposits  advances from the fhlb and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits  repay maturing borrowings  fund existing and future loans and make investments 
as of december   asb had commitments to borrowers for undisbursed loan funds  loan commitments and unused lines and letters of credit of billion 
management believes asb s current sources of funds will enable it to meet these commitments and obligations while maintaining liquidity at satisfactory levels 
as of december  and  asb had million of loans on nonaccrual status  or of net loans outstanding 
as of december  and  asb s real estate acquired in settlement of loans was nil and million  respectively 
in  net cash of million was provided by investing activities primarily due to repayments of investment and mortgage related securities and sales of mortgage related securities  net of purchases  partly offset by net increases in loans held for investment and capital expenditures 
financing activities used net cash of million due to net decreases in other borrowings and the payment of common stock dividends  partly offset by net increases in deposits 
operating activities provided cash of million 
asb believes that a satisfactory regulatory capital position provides a basis for public confidence  affords protection to depositors  helps to ensure continued access to capital markets on favorable terms and provides a foundation for growth 
fdic regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that are not well capitalized to compete on the same terms as well capitalized institutions  such as by offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions 
as of december   asb was well capitalized see regulation of asb for asb s capital ratios 

table of contents certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control and could cause future results of operations to differ materially from historical results 
the following is a discussion of certain of these factors 
see also forward looking statements above and item a 
risk factors 
consolidated economic conditions 
because its core businesses are providing local electric utility and banking services  hei s operating results are significantly influenced by the strength of hawaii s economy  which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland us particularly california and asia particularly japan as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism 
see economic conditions above 
competition 
the electric utility and banking industries are competitive and the company s success in meeting competition will continue to have a direct impact on the company s financial performance 
electric utility 
although competition in the generation sector in hawaii has been moderated by the scarcity of generation sites  various permitting processes and lack of interconnections to other electric utilities  heco and its subsidiaries face competition from ipps and customer self generation  with or without cogeneration 
in march  the puc approved a standard form contract for customer retention that allows helco to provide a rate option for customers who would otherwise reduce their energy use from helco s system by using energy from a nonutility generator 
based on helco s current rates  the standard form contract provides a discount on base energy rates for qualifying large power and general service demand customers 
in november  helco entered into three year standard form contracts with two of its hotel customers 
in  the puc issued an order instituting a proceeding to identify and examine the issues surrounding electric competition and to determine the impact of competition on the electric utility infrastructure in hawaii 
in october  the puc closed the competition proceeding and opened investigative proceedings on two specific issues competitive bidding and dg to move toward a more competitive electric industry environment under cost based regulation 
competitive bidding proceeding 
the stated purpose of this proceeding is to evaluate competitive bidding as a mechanism for acquiring or building new generating capacity in hawaii 
the parties in the proceeding included the consumer advocate  heco  helco  meco  kauai island utility cooperative kiuc and hawaii renewable energy alliance hrea  a renewable energy organization 
the issues addressed in the proceeding included whether a competitive bidding system should be developed for acquiring or building new generation and  if so  how a fair system can be developed that ensures that competitive benefits result from the system and ratepayers are not placed at undue risk  what the guidelines and requirements for prospective bidders should be  and how such a system can encourage broad participation 
on june   the puc issued a decision in this proceeding  which included a proposed framework to govern competitive bidding as a mechanism for acquiring or building new generation in hawaii 
the decision required the parties to submit comments on the proposed framework 
on september   heco  helco and meco  the consumer advocate and hrea each submitted comments on the proposed framework and responded to the purpa issues in the decision 
kiuc had no comments on the proposed framework 
on december   the puc issued a decision which reviewed the parties comments and revised the competitive bidding framework  which became effective from the issuance of the decision 
the framework states  among other things  that a utility is required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource or a block of generation resources unless the puc finds bidding to be unsuitable  the determination on whether to use competitive bidding for a future generation resource or a block of generation resources will be made by the puc during its review of the utility s irp  an exemption from the framework is granted for cooperatively owned utilities  the framework does not apply to two pending projects heco s cip and helco s st  meco s m project which went into commercial operation in october  specifically identified offers to sell energy on an as available basis or to sell firm energy and or capacity by non fossil fuel producers that were under review by an electric utility at the time this framework was adopted provided that negotiations with the non fossil producers are 
table of contents completed no later than december   and certain other situations as identified in the framework  waivers from competitive bidding for certain circumstances will be considered by the puc and granted when considered appropriate  for each project that is subject to competitive bidding  the utility is required to submit a report on the cost of parallel planning upon the puc s request  the utility is required to consider the effects on competitive bidding of not allowing bidders access to utility owned or controlled sites  and to present reasons to the puc for not allowing site access to bidders when the utility has not chosen to offer a site to a third party  the utility is required to select an independent observer from a list approved by the puc whenever the utility or its affiliate seeks to advance a project proposal ie  in competition with those offered by bidders in response to a need that is addressed by its request for proposal rfp or when the puc otherwise determines  the evaluation of the utility s bid should account for the possibility that the capital or running costs actually incurred  and recovered from ratepayers  over the plant s lifetime  will vary from the levels assumed in the utility s bid  the utility may consider its own self bid proposals in response to generation needs identified in its rfp  and for any resource to which competitive bidding does not apply due to waiver or exemption  the utility retains its traditional obligation to offer to purchase capacity and energy from a qualifying facility qf at avoided cost upon reasonable terms and conditions approved by the puc 
the decision also ordered the utilities to file proposed tariffs containing procedures for interconnection and transmission upgrades within days from the issuance of the framework  and proposed codes of conduct within days from the issuance of the framework  or prior to commencement of any competitive bidding process  whichever comes first 
management cannot currently predict the ultimate effect of this decision on the ability of the electric utilities to acquire or build additional generating capacity in the future 
distributed generation proceeding 
in october  the puc opened a dg proceeding to determine dg s potential benefits to and impact on hawaii s electric distribution systems and markets and to develop policies and a framework for dg projects deployed in hawaii 
on january   the puc issued its d o in the dg proceeding 
in the d o  the puc indicated that its policy is to promote the development of a market structure that assures dg is available at the lowest feasible cost  dg that is economical and reliable has an opportunity to come to fruition and dg that is not cost effective does not enter the system 
with regard to dg ownership  the d o affirmed the ability of the electric utilities to procure and operate dg for utility purposes at utility sites 
the puc also indicated its desire to promote the development of a competitive market for customer sited dg 
in weighing the general advantages and disadvantages of allowing a utility to provide dg services on a customer s site  the puc found that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages 
however  the puc also found that the utility is the most informed potential provider of dg and it would not be in the public interest to exclude the electric utilities from providing dg services at this early stage of dg market development 
therefore  the d o allows the utility to provide dg services on a customer owned site as a regulated service when the dg resolves a legitimate system need  the dg is the lowest cost alternative to meet that need  and it can be shown that  in an open and competitive process acceptable to the puc  the customer operator was unable to find another entity ready and able to supply the proposed dg service at a price and quality comparable to the utility s offering 
on march   the electric utilities filed a motion for clarification and or partial reconsideration dg motion  requesting that the puc clarify how the three conditions under which electric utilities are allowed to provide regulated dg services at customer owned sites will be administered  in order to better determine the impacts the conditions may have on the electric utilities dg plans 
on april   the puc issued its decision on the electric utilities motion and provided clarification to the conditions under which the electric utilities are allowed to provide regulated dg services eg  the utilities can use a portfolio perspective a dg project aggregated with other dg systems and other supply side and demand side options to support a finding that utility owned customer sited dg projects fulfill a legitimate system need  and the economic standard of least cost in the order means lowest reasonable cost consistent with the standard in the irp framework  and affirmed that the electric utility has the responsibility to demonstrate that it meets all applicable criteria included in the d o in its application for puc approval to proceed with a specific dg project 
the electric utilities are currently evaluating several potential dg and combined heat and power chp  a form of dg projects 
if a decision is made to pursue a specific project  an application requesting project approval will be 
table of contents filed with the puc 
in july  meco filed an application for approval of an agreement for the installation of a chp system on the island of lanai 
on september   the puc issued a schedule of proceedings for its consideration of this chp project 
the consumer advocate filed its statement of position in january and meco filed its response to the consumer advocate s statement of position in february prior to opening of the investigative dg proceeding  in october the electric utilities filed an application for approval of chp tariffs  under which they would own  operate and maintain customer sited  packaged chp systems and certain ancillary equipment pursuant to standard form contracts with eligible commercial customers 
this chp tariff application and a helco application for approval of an agreement with a customer for a utility chp project were suspended by the puc until  at a minimum  the matters in the dg proceeding were adequately addressed 
by letters dated november   the puc requested that the utilities state their intentions with regard to pursuing the chp tariff application and that helco state its intentions with regard to its chp project application  given the puc criteria for allowing regulated utility owned dg stated in the dg proceeding d o 
on december   the utilities withdrew their chp tariff application  based on the determination that it would be difficult to implement chp projects on a programmatic basis given the criteria of the d o 
the utilities will continue to consider chp projects on a case by case basis  and if a decision is made to pursue the implementation of a chp project  then an application will be filed requesting puc approval of such chp project 
on december   helco withdrew its chp project application for a particular customer on the basis that the d o would require substantial modifications to the application and existing chp agreement 
helco is continuing to work with its customer with respect to chp and or other energy cost savings alternatives  and if a decision is made to pursue the implementation of a chp system  then an application will be filed requesting puc approval of a new chp agreement 
the d o also required the electric utilities to file tariffs  establish reliability and safety requirements for dg  establish a non discriminatory dg interconnection policy  develop a standardized interconnection agreement to streamline the dg application review process  establish standby rates based on unbundled costs associated with providing each service ie  generation  distribution  transmission and ancillary services  and establish detailed affiliate requirements should the utility choose to sell dg through an affiliate 
the electric utilities filed their proposed modifications to existing dg interconnection tariffs and their proposed unbundled standby rates for puc approval in the third quarter of the consumer advocate stated that it did not object to implementation of the interconnection and standby rate tariffs at the present time  but reserved the right to review the reasonableness of both tariffs in rate proceedings for each of the utilities 
by order dated december   the puc opened a new proceeding to investigate the utilities proposed dg interconnection tariff modifications and standby rate tariffs 
bank 
the banking industry in hawaii is highly competitive 
asb is the third largest financial institution in hawaii  based on assets  and is in direct competition for deposits and loans  not only with the two larger institutions  but also with smaller institutions that are heavily promoting their services in certain niche areas  such as providing financial services to small and medium sized businesses  and national organizations offering financial services 
asb s main competitors are banks  savings associations  credit unions  mortgage brokers  finance companies and securities brokerage firms 
these competitors offer a variety of lending  deposit and investment products to retail and business customers 
the primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates  the quality and range of services offered  marketing  convenience of locations  hours of operation and perceptions of the institution s financial soundness and safety 
to meet competition  asb offers a variety of savings and checking accounts at competitive rates  convenient business hours  convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each branch and convenient automated teller machines 
asb also conducts advertising and promotional campaigns 
the primary factors in competing for first mortgage and other loans are interest rates  loan origination fees and the quality and range of lending and other services offered 
asb believes that it is able to compete for such loans primarily through the competitive interest rates and loan fees it charges  the type of mortgage loan programs it offers and the efficiency and quality of the services it provides to individual borrowers and the business community 
asb is a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers and has been diversifying its loan portfolio from single family home mortgages to higher yielding  shorter duration consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the origination of consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans involves risks and other considerations different from those associated with originating residential real estate 
table of contents loans 
for example  the sources and level of competition may be different and credit risk is generally higher than for mortgage loans 
these different risk factors are considered in the underwriting and pricing standards and in the allowance for loan losses established by asb for its consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans 
us capital markets and interest rate environment 
changes in the us capital markets can have significant effects on the company 
for example volatility in us capital markets can affect the fair values of assets available to satisfy retirement benefits obligations 
the company estimates that consolidated retirement benefits expense  net of amounts capitalized and income taxes  will be million in as compared to million in  partly as a result of changing the expected long term rate of return assumption in recognition of lower expected future returns in the capital markets 
volatility in us capital markets may negatively impact the fair values of investment and mortgage related securities held by asb 
as of december   the fair value and carrying value of the investment and mortgage related securities held by asb were billion 
interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations 
asb actively manages this risk  including managing the relationship of its interest sensitive assets to its interest sensitive liabilities 
the federal reserve began increasing rates in  while longer term interest rates have not increased significantly  causing a flattening of the yield curve 
the yield curve was inverted throughout the second half of this type of interest rate environment typically puts downward pressure on asb s net interest margin 
as of december   the company had no floating rate long term debt outstanding 
as of december   consolidated hei had million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of and maturities ranging from to days 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
technological developments 
new technological developments eg  the commercial development of fuel cells or distributed generation or significant advances in internet banking may impact the company s future competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
limited insurance 
in the ordinary course of business  the company purchases insurance coverages eg  property and liability coverages to protect itself against loss of or damage to its properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries 
however  the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and  in some instances  the company has no coverage 
for electric utility examples  see limited insurance in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
asb also has no insurance coverage for business interruption or credit card fraud 
certain of the company s insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered 
insurers also have exclusions or limitations of coverage for claims related to certain perils including  but not limited to  mold and terrorism 
if a series of losses occurred  such as from a series of lawsuits in the ordinary course of business each of which were subject to the deductible amount  or if the maximum limit of the available insurance were substantially exceeded  the company could incur uninsured losses in amounts that would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
environmental matters 
hei and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws and regulations that regulate the operation of existing facilities  the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances 
these laws and regulations  among other things  require that certain environmental permits be obtained as a condition to constructing or operating certain facilities 
obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays 
also  these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time  including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance 
management believes that the recovery through rates of most  if not all  of any costs incurred by heco and its subsidiaries in complying with environmental requirements would be allowed by the puc 
the heco  helco and meco generating stations operate under air pollution control permits issued by the doh and  in a limited number of cases  by the epa 
the legislature passed legislation that clarifies that the accepting agency or authority for an environmental impact statement is not required to be the approving agency for the permit or approval and also requires an environmental assessment for proposed waste to energy facilities  landfills  oil refineries  power generating facilities greater than mw and wastewater facilities  except individual wastewater systems 
this legislation could result in an increase in project costs 

table of contents the entire electric utility industry has been affected by the amendments to the clean air act caa  changes to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone  and adoption of a naaqs for fine particulate matter 
further significant impacts may occur if currently proposed legislation  rules and standards are adopted eg  greenhouse gas emission reduction rules or are deemed applicable to company facilities eg  regional haze rule amendments 
pending environmental matters that may adversely affect the company s future operating results and financial condition include the ongoing honolulu harbor environmental investigation  the july regional haze rule amendments and section b of the federal clean water act  which are discussed under environmental regulation in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that a significant environmental liability will not be incurred by the electric utilities or that the related costs will be recoverable through rates 
prior to extending a loan secured by real property  asb conducts due diligence to assess whether or not the property may present environmental risks and potential cleanup liability 
in the event of default and foreclosure of a loan  asb may become the owner of the mortgaged property 
for that reason  asb seeks to avoid lending upon the security of  or acquiring through foreclosure  any property with significant potential environmental risks  however  there can be no assurance that asb will successfully avoid all such environmental risks 
electric utility regulation of electric utility rates 
the rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge for their services  and the timeliness of permitted rate increases  are among the most important items influencing their financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
the puc has broad discretion over the rates the electric utilities charge and other matters 
any adverse decision by the puc concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates  the authorized returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable  the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns  or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse affect on the company s and heco s consolidated results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
upon a showing of probable entitlement  the puc is required to issue an interim d o in a rate case within months from the date of filing a completed application if the evidentiary hearing is completed subject to extension for days if the evidentiary hearing is not completed 
there is no time limit for rendering a final d o 
interim rate increases are subject to refund with interest  pending the final outcome of the case 
through december   heco and its subsidiaries had recognized million of revenues with respect to interim orders regarding certain integrated resource planning costs and heco s general rate increase  which revenues are subject to refund  with interest  if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders 
the consumer advocate has objected to the recovery of million before interest of the million of incremental irp costs incurred by the utilities during the period  and the puc s decision is pending on this matter 
in addition  meco incurred approximately million of incremental integrated resource planning costs for  for which the consumer advocate has not yet stated its position 
see most recent rate requests heco above for a discussion of the status of the current heco rate case 
management cannot predict with certainty when the final d os in the pending two heco rate cases  the helco rate case or the meco rate case  or in future rate cases  will be rendered or the amount of any interim or final rate increase that may be granted 
further  the increasing levels of o m expenses including increased retirement benefit costs  increased plant in service  or other factors have and are likely to continue to result in the electric utilities seeking rate relief more often than in the past 
the rate schedules of each of hei s electric utilities include energy cost adjustment clauses ecacs under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power  and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power 
in puc decisions approving the electric utilities fuel supply contracts  the puc affirmed the electric utilities right to include in their respective ecacs the stated costs incurred pursuant to their respective new fuel supply contracts  to the extent that these costs are not included in their respective base rates  and restated its intention to examine the need for continued use of ecacs in rate cases 
act of the hawaii legislature requires such examination and specifies certain factors that must be considered 
see energy cost adjustment clauses in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents fuel oil and purchased power 
the electric utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and ipps to deliver fuel oil and power  respectively 
see fuel contracts and power purchase agreements ppas in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company estimates that of the net energy generated and purchased by heco and its subsidiaries in will be generated from the burning of oil 
purchased kwhs provided approximately of the total net energy generated and purchased in compared to in and in failure or delay by the electric utilities oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing supply contracts  or failure by a major independent power producer to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its ppa  could interrupt the ability of the electric utilities to deliver electricity  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s results of operations and financial condition 
heco generally maintains an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to days of forward consumption 
helco and meco generally maintain an inventory level equivalent to one month s supply of both medium sulfur fuel oil and diesel fuel 
the electric utilities major sources of oil  through their suppliers  are in china  vietnam and the far east 
some  but not all  of the electric utilities ppas require that the ipps maintain minimum fuel inventory levels and all of the firm capacity ppas include provisions imposing substantial penalties for failure to produce the firm capacity anticipated by those agreements 
other operation and maintenance expenses 
other operation and maintenance expenses increased  and for  and  respectively  when compared to the prior year 
this trend of increased operation and maintenance expenses is expected to continue in as the electric utilities anticipate higher dsm expenses that are passed on to customers through a surcharge and therefore do not impact net income and integrated resource planning expenses  higher employee benefits expenses  primarily for retirement benefits and higher production expenses  primarily to meet higher demand levels and load growth set in and sustained in and the timing and amount of these expenses can vary as circumstances change 
for example  recent overhauls have been more expensive than in the past due to the larger scope of work necessary to maintain the aging equipment  which has experienced heavier usage as demand has increased to current levels 
until an overhaul is fully underway  it is possible that the maintenance costs for a generating unit may be significantly higher than originally planned 
increased operation and maintenance expenses were among the reasons heco in november and december  helco in may and meco in february filed requests with the puc to increase base rates 
in september  heco received interim rate relief for its request filed in november see most recent rate requests 
other regulatory and permitting contingencies 
many public utility projects require puc approval and various permits eg  environmental and land use permits from other agencies 
delays in obtaining puc approval or permits can result in increased costs 
if a project does not proceed or if the puc disallows costs of the project  the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
two major capital improvement utility projects  the keahole project and the east oahu transmission project  have encountered opposition and have been seriously delayed although ct and ct at keahole are now operating 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
helco is seeking to recover keahole costs in its current rate case 

table of contents bank regulation of asb 
asb is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the department of treasury  ots and the fdic  and is subject to reserve requirements established by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
regulation by these agencies focuses in large measure on the adequacy of asb s capital and the results of periodic safety and soundness examinations conducted by the ots 
asb s insurance product sales activities  including those conducted by asb s insurance agency subsidiary  bishop insurance agency of hawaii  inc  are subject to regulation by the hawaii insurance commissioner 
capital requirements 
the ots  which is asb s principal regulator  administers two sets of capital standards minimum regulatory capital requirements and prompt corrective action requirements 
the fdic also has prompt corrective action capital requirements 
as of december   asb was in compliance with ots minimum regulatory capital requirements and was well capitalized within the meaning of ots prompt corrective action regulations and fdic capital regulations  as follows asb met applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements noted in parentheses as of december  with a tangible capital ratio of  a core capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
asb met the capital requirements to be generally considered well capitalized noted in parentheses as of december  with a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
the purpose of the prompt corrective action capital requirements is to establish thresholds for varying degrees of oversight and intervention by regulators 
declines in levels of capital  depending on their severity  will result in increasingly stringent mandatory and discretionary regulatory consequences 
capital levels may decline for any number of reasons  including reductions that would result if there were losses from operations  deterioration in collateral values or the inability to dispose of real estate owned such as by foreclosure 
the regulators have substantial discretion in the corrective actions they might direct and could include restrictions on dividends and other distributions that asb may make to hei through heidi and the requirement that asb develop and implement a plan to restore its capital 
under an agreement with regulators entered into by hei when it acquired asb  hei could be required to contribute to asb up to an additional million of capital  if necessary to maintain asb s capital position 
examinations 
asb is subject to periodic safety and soundness examinations and other examinations by the ots 
in conducting its examinations  the ots utilizes the uniform financial institutions rating system adopted by the federal financial institutions examination council  which system utilizes the camels criteria for rating financial institutions 
the six components in the rating system are capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market risk 
the ots examines and rates each camels component 
an overall camels rating is also given  after taking into account all of the component ratings 
a financial institution may be subject to formal regulatory or administrative direction or supervision such as a memorandum of understanding or a cease and desist order following an examination if its camels rating is not satisfactory 
an institution is prohibited from disclosing the ots s report of its safety and soundness examination or the component and overall camels rating to any person or organization not officially connected with the institution as an officer  director  employee  attorney  or auditor  except as provided by regulation 
the ots also regularly examines asb s information technology practices  and its performance as related to the community reinvestment act measurement criteria 
the federal deposit insurance act  as amended  addresses the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system  supervision of depository institutions and improvement of accounting standards 
pursuant to this act  federal banking agencies have promulgated regulations that affect the operations of asb and its holding companies eg  standards for safety and soundness  real estate lending  accounting and reporting  transactions with affiliates and loans to insiders 
fdic regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that fail to meet relevant capital measures to engage in certain activities  such as offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions 
as of december   asb was well capitalized and thus not subject to these restrictions 

table of contents qualified thrift lender status 
asb is a qualified thrift lender qtl under its federal thrift charter and  in order to maintain this status  asb is required to maintain at least of its assets in qualified thrift investments  which include housing related loans including mortgage related securities as well as certain small business loans  education loans  loans made through credit card accounts and a basket not exceeding of total assets of other consumer loans and other assets 
savings associations that fail to maintain qtl status are subject to various penalties  including limitations on their activities 
in asb s case  the activities of hei  heidi and hei s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions if asb failed to maintain its qtl status  and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of asb 
as of december   approximately of its assets were qualified thrift investments 
federal thrift charter 
the gramm leach bliley act of the gramm act permitted banks  insurance companies and investment firms to compete directly against each other  thereby allowing one stop shopping for an array of financial services 
although the gramm act further restricted the creation of so called unitary savings and loan holding companies ie  companies such as hei whose subsidiaries include one or more savings associations and one or more nonfinancial subsidiaries  the unitary savings and loan holding company relationship among hei  heidi and asb is grandfathered under the gramm act so that hei and its subsidiaries will be able to continue to engage in their current activities so long as asb maintains its qtl status 
under the gramm act  any proposed sale of asb would have to satisfy applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and potential acquirers of asb would most likely be limited to companies that are already qualified as  or capable of qualifying as  either a traditional savings and loan association holding company or a bank holding company  or as one of the newly authorized financial holding companies permitted under the gramm act 

table of contents material estimates and critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for investment and mortgage related securities  property  plant and equipment  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  contingencies and litigation  income taxes  regulatory assets and liabilities  electric utility revenues  variable interest entities vies  and allowance for loan losses 
management considers an accounting estimate to be material if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the assumptions selected could have a material impact on the estimate and on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
for example  in  a significant change in estimated income taxes occurred as a result of a tax appeal court decision see asb state franchise tax dispute and settlement in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  management has identified the following accounting policies it believes to be the most critical to the company s financial statements that is  management believes that the policies below are both the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and currently require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
these policies are identified according to whether they affect both of the company s two principal segments  or just one of these segments 
management has reviewed the material estimates and critical accounting policies with the hei audit committee and  as applicable  the heco audit committee 
for additional discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated investment and mortgage related securities 
debt securities that the company intends to and has the ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost 
marketable equity securities and debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
marketable equity securities and debt securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and temporary losses excluded from earnings and reported in aoci 
for securities that are not trading securities  declines in value determined to be other than temporary are included in earnings and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
the specific identification method is used in determining realized gains and losses on the sales of securities 
asb owns federal agency obligations  private issue mortgage related securities and mortgage related securities issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  government national mortgage association gnma and federal national mortgage association fnma  all of which are classified as available for sale 
asb obtains market prices for investment and mortgage related securities from a third party financial services provider 
the prices of these securities may be influenced by factors such as market liquidity  corporate credit considerations of the underlying collateral  the levels of interest rates  expectations of prepayments and defaults  limited investor base  market sector concerns  and overall market psychology 
adverse changes in any of these factors may result in additional losses 
as of december   asb had mortgage related securities issued by fhlmc  gnma and fnma valued at billion and private issue mortgage related securities valued at billion 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are reported at cost 
self constructed electric utility plant includes engineering  supervision  and administrative and general costs  and an allowance for the cost of funds used during the construction period 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to property  plant and equipment when construction is completed and the facilities are either placed in service or become useful for public utility purposes 
upon the retirement or sale of electric utility plant  no gain or 
table of contents loss is recognized 
the cost of the plant retired is charged to accumulated depreciation 
amounts collected from customers for cost of removal expected to exceed salvage value in the future are included in regulatory liabilities 
heco and its subsidiaries evaluate the impact of applying emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  to their new ppas  ppa amendments and other arrangements they enter into 
a possible outcome of the evaluation is that an arrangement falls within the scope of eitf and results in its classification as a capital lease  which could have a material effect on heco s consolidated balance sheet if a significant amount of capital assets and lease obligations needed to be recorded 
management believes that the puc will allow recovery of property  plant and equipment in its electric rates 
if the puc does not allow recovery of any such costs  the electric utility would be required to write off the disallowed costs at that time 
see the discussion in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements concerning costs recorded for ct and ct at keahole and the east oahu transmission project

contingencies and litigation 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to environmental matters 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses  including costs of investigation 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual case or proceeding often with the assistance of outside counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach in dealing with these matters  such as a change in settlement strategy 
in general  environmental contamination treatment costs are charged to expense  unless it is probable that the puc would allow such costs to be recovered through future rates  in which case such costs would be capitalized as regulatory assets 
also  environmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity  or improve the safety or efficiency of property  the costs mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination  or the costs are incurred in preparing the property for sale 
see environmental regulation in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the honolulu harbor investigation 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such deferred tax assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes  regulations and rules 
management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience  previous actions by taxing authorities eg  actions taken in other jurisdictions and advice from tax experts 
management believes that the company s provision for tax contingencies is reasonable 
however  the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect the company s current and deferred income tax amounts

 which was adopted on january  also  see note  income taxes  of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents electric utility regulatory assets and liabilities 
the electric utilities are regulated by the puc 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  the company s financial statements reflect assets  liabilities  revenues and costs of heco and its subsidiaries based on current cost based rate making regulations 
the actions of regulators can affect the timing of recognition of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
regulatory liabilities represent amounts collected from customers for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because their recovery in future customer rates is probable 
as of december   regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets amounted to million and million  respectively 
regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets are itemized in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environment 
because current rates include the recovery of regulatory assets existing as of the last rate case and rates in effect allow the utilities to earn a reasonable rate of return  management believes that the recovery of the regulatory assets as of december  is probable 
this determination assumes continuation of the current political and regulatory climate in hawaii  and is subject to change in the future 
management believes heco and its subsidiaries operations currently satisfy the sfas no 
criteria 
if events or circumstances should change so that those criteria are no longer satisfied  the electric utilities expect that the regulatory assets would be charged to income and the regulatory liabilities would be credited to income or refunded to ratepayers 
in the event of unforeseen regulatory actions or other circumstances  however  management believes that a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position may result if regulatory assets have to be charged to expense without an offsetting credit for regulatory liabilities or if regulatory liabilities are required to be refunded to ratepayers 
electric utility revenues 
electric utility revenues are based on rates authorized by the puc and include revenues applicable to energy consumed in the accounting period but not yet billed to customers 
as of december   revenues applicable to energy consumed  but not yet billed to customers  amounted to million 
revenue amounts recorded pursuant to a puc interim order are subject to refund  with interest  pending a final order 
as of december   heco and its subsidiaries had recognized million of such revenues with respect to interim orders 
also  the rate schedules of the electric utilities include ecacs under which electric rates are adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power  and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power 
see regulation of electric utility rates above 
consolidation of vies 
in december  the fasb issued revised fin no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
the company evaluates the impact of applying fin r to its relationships with ipps with whom the electric utilities execute new ppas or execute amendments of existing ppas 
a possible outcome of the analysis is that heco or its subsidiaries  as applicable may be found to meet the definition of a primary beneficiary of a vie the ipp which finding may result in the consolidation of the ipp in heco s consolidated financial statements 
the consolidation of ipps could have a material effect on heco s consolidated financial statements  including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities  and  if such a consolidated ipp were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity  the potential recognition of such losses 
the electric utilities do not know how the consolidation of ipps would be treated for regulatory or credit ratings purposes 
see general consolidation consolidation of vies in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents bank allowance for loan losses 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   asb s allowance for loan losses was million and asb had million of loans on nonaccrual status 
in  asb recorded a provision for loan losses of million 
although management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate  the actual loan losses  provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses may be materially different if conditions change eg  if there is a significant change in the hawaii economy  and material increases in those amounts could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial position

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hei the company manages various market risks in the ordinary course of business  including credit risk and liquidity risk 
the company believes the electric utility and other segments exposures to these two risks are not material as of december  credit risk for asb is the risk that borrowers or issuers of securities will not be able to repay their obligations to the bank 
credit risk associated with the lending portfolios is controlled through asb s underwriting standards  loan rating of commercial and commercial real estate loans  on going monitoring by loan officers  credit review and quality control functions in these lending areas and adequate allowance for loan losses 
credit risk associated with the securities portfolio is mitigated by asb s asset liability management process  experienced staff working with analytical tools  monthly fair value analysis and on going monitoring and reporting such as investment watch reports and loss sensitivity analysis 
see allowance for loan losses above 
liquidity risk for asb is the risk that the bank will not meet its obligations when they become due 
liquidity risk is mitigated by asb s asset liability management process  on going analytical analysis  monitoring and reporting information such as weekly cash flow analyses and maintenance of liquidity contingency plans 
the company is exposed to some commodity price risk primarily related to its fuel supply and ipp contracts 
the company s commodity price risk is substantially mitigated so long as the electric utilities have their current ecacs in their rate schedules 
see discussion of the ecacs in certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition electric utility regulation of electric utility rates 
the company currently has no hedges against its commodity price risk 
because the company does not have a large portfolio of trading assets  the company is not exposed to significant market risk from trading activities 
the company s currently has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company considers interest rate risk to be a very significant market risk as it could potentially have a significant effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition  especially as it relates to asb  but also as it may affect the discount rate used to determine pension liabilities  the market value of pension plans assets and the electric utilities allowed rates of return 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the company s earnings to adverse movements in interest rates 
bank interest rate risk the company s success is dependent  in part  upon asb s ability to manage interest rate risk 
asb s interest rate risk profile is strongly influenced by its primary business of making fixed rate residential mortgage loans and taking in retail deposits 
large mismatches in the amounts or timing between the maturity or repricing of interest sensitive assets or liabilities could adversely affect asb s earnings and the market value of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities in the event of significant changes in the level of interest rates 
many other factors also affect asb s exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  and competition for loans or deposits 
asb s asset liability management committee alco  whose voting members are officers and employees of asb  is responsible for managing interest rate risk and carrying out the overall asset liability management objectives and activities of asb as approved by the asb board of directors 
alco establishes policies under which management monitors and coordinates asb s assets and liabilities 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the use of rate lock commitments on loans held for sale and forward sale contracts to manage some interest rate risk associated with asb s residential loan sale program 
management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis with an emphasis on measuring changes in net interest income nii and the market value of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in different interest rate environments 
the simulation analysis is performed using a dedicated asset liability management software system enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation cmo database 
the simulation software is capable of generating scenario specific cash flows for all instruments using the specified contractual information for each instrument and product specific prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage related securities 

table of contents nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pre tax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios 
nii sensitivity is measured as the change in nii in the alternate interest rate scenarios as a percentage of the base case nii 
the base case interest rate scenario is established using the current yield curve and assumes interest rates remain constant over the next twelve months 
the alternate scenarios were created by assuming rate ramps or gradual interest changes and accomplished by moving the yield curve in a parallel fashion  over the next twelve month period  in increments of basis points 
the simulation model forecasts scenario specific principal and interest cash flows for the interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the nii is calculated for each scenario 
key balance sheet modeling assumptions used in the nii sensitivity analysis include the size of the balance sheet remains relatively constant over the simulation horizon and maturing assets or liabilities are reinvested in similar instruments in order to maintain the current mix of the balance sheet 
in addition  assumptions are made about the prepayment behavior of mortgage related assets  future pricing spreads for new assets and liabilities  and the speed and magnitude with which deposit rates change in response to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
asb s net portfolio value npv ratio is a measure of the economic capitalization of asb 
the npv ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value of asb to the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets 
net portfolio value represents the theoretical market value of asb s net worth and is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio is calculated by asb pursuant to guidelines established by the ots in thrift bulletin a 
key assumptions used in the calculation of asb s npv ratio include the prepayment behavior of loans and investments  the possible distribution of future interest rates  pricing spreads for assets and liabilities in the alternate scenarios and the rate and balance behavior of deposit accounts with indeterminate maturities 
typically  if the value of asb s assets grows relative to the value of its liabilities  the npv ratio will increase 
conversely  if the value of asb s liabilities grows relative to the value of its assets  the npv ratio will decrease 
the npv ratio is calculated in multiple scenarios 
as with the nii simulation  the base case is represented by the current yield curve 
alternate scenarios are created by assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve in increments of basis points 
the npv ratio sensitivity measure is the change from the npv ratio calculated in the base case to the npv ratio calculated in the alternate rate scenarios 
the sensitivity measure alone is not necessarily indicative of the interest rate risk of an institution  as institutions with high levels of capital may be able to support a high sensitivity measure 
this measure is evaluated in conjunction with the npv ratio calculated in each scenario 
asb s interest rate risk sensitivity measures as of december  and constitute forward looking statements and were as follows december change in nii npv ratio npv ratio sensitivity change in nii npv ratio npv ratio sensitivity change in interest rates basis points gradual change instantaneous change gradual change instantaneous change base change from base case in basis points 
management believes that asb s interest rate risk position as of december  represents a reasonable level of risk 
under the gradual interest rate change scenarios  the december  nii profile is slightly more sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to the nii profile on december  shifts in asb s funding mix contributed to the slight increase in sensitivity 
asb s base npv ratio as of december  was slightly lower than on december   primarily as a result of changes in the level and shape of the yield curve 

table of contents asb s npv ratio sensitivity measures as of december  were comparable to the measures as of december  the computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes on the nii sensitivity  npv ratio  and npv ratio sensitivity analyses is based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  balance changes and pricing strategies  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
to the extent market conditions and other factors vary from the assumptions used in the simulation analysis  actual results may differ materially from the simulation results 
furthermore  nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pre tax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios  and is intended to help management identify potential exposures in asb s current balance sheet and formulate appropriate strategies for managing interest rate risk 
the simulation does not contemplate any actions that asb management might undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
further  the changes in nii vary in the twelve month simulation period and are not necessarily evenly distributed over the period 
these analyses are for analytical purposes only and do not represent management s views of future market movements  the level of future earnings  or the timing of any changes in earnings within the twelve month analysis horizon 
the actual impact of changes in interest rates on nii will depend on the magnitude and speed with which rates change  actual changes in the asb s balance sheet  and management s responses to the changes in interest rates 
other than bank interest rate risk the company s general policy is to manage other than bank interest rate risk through use of a combination of short term debt  long term debt primarily fixed rate debt and preferred securities 
as of december   management believes the company is exposed to other than bank interest rate risk because of their periodic borrowing requirements  the impact of interest rates on the discount rate and the market value of plan assets used to determine retirement benefits expenses and obligations see retirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefits in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities allowed rates of return see regulation of electric utility rates
