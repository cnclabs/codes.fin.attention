item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except share and per share amounts or unless otherwise noted the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and  included in item of this form k 
overview general we derive our revenue from engineering  construction  and engineering  procurement and construction epc services provided to the oil  gas and power industries and government entities 
through the company and our predecessors  we have provided services to customers in over countries for almost years 
during  we generated revenue from continuing operations primarily in the united states  canada  and oman 
we obtain our work through competitive bidding and through negotiations with prospective clients 
contract values may range from a few thousand dollars to several hundred million dollars and contract durations range from a few weeks to more than two years 
our strategy is to deploy our resources in markets for our engineering  construction and epc services that can provide the highest risk adjusted return  while maintaining a balanced backlog with respect to commercial and political risks and market presence 
our overall strategy has not changed  however  as the fundamental drivers in different markets around the world change  our tactical approach is continuously adjusted and refined 
because of our ongoing evaluation of the company s operations and markets  we are employing a new set of tactics to optimize the risk adjusted returns we seek 
in late june  this evaluation process resulted in our decision to sell our operations in nigeria  joining venezuela and the txp plant as the company s discontinued operations discontinued operations 
we concluded that the operating and commercial risks associated with doing business in nigeria have exceeded our acceptable risk levels 
on february   we sold our nigeria operations through a share purchase agreement for a total consideration of  under the terms of the share purchase agreement with ascot offshore nigeria limited ascot  a nigerian energy services company  we received  in cash with a  note for the balance of the purchase price for the shares of wg nigeria holdings limited  the holding company which owns the operating and equipment companies supporting our activities in nigeria 
on february   we received  as partial payment on the note which is due and payable no later than august  the final net proceeds to the company are subject to post closing working capital and other adjustments 
due to the many variables affecting the company s contracts and commercial negotiations in nigeria  the final adjustments may not be determined for several months  and those adjustments may be substantial  but are not expected to result in the recognition of a loss on this sale 
in conjunction with this transaction  we purchased certain minority interests at a total cost of  the sale of our venezuela operations was completed during the fourth quarter of the sale of the txp plant in opal  wyoming  was completed in the first quarter of therefore  included in discontinued operations are the financial results of the operations of the txp plant and the nigeria and venezuela operations collectively the discontinued operations 
see note discontinuance of operations and asset disposal in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item in the form k for additional information on discontinued operations 
with our exit from nigeria and latin america  we can now refocus our attention and resources to north america and a few other selected international markets 
we also expect to benefit from additional cost savings which we can realize through a more opportunistic approach to our international business currently operating from our base in oman where we are well positioned for project work in the middle east and north africa 
we believe the fundamentals supporting the demand for engineering  construction and epc services for the energy industry  particularly for pipeline services in north america  will continue to be strong for the next two to

index to financial statements five years 
many positive developments reinforce our view 
capital spending for the exploration and production sector of the energy industry is expected to exceed billion in  this is a percent increase over even with lower forecasted crude oil prices  the oil sands region of western canada forecasted capital expenditures on new bitumen production and processing facilities are expected to exceed c billion through  as production levels are increased from approximately one million barrels per day presently to more than three million barrels per day in in the united states  new gas production in the rocky mountain region has generated plans for gas pipelines to the west  midwest and east coast 
liquefied natural gas is also expected to bring more opportunities to willbros  both in north america and in other producing exporting countries 
the engineering market in north america continues to be capacity constrained 
we are selecting and accepting assignments that offer higher margins and better contract terms and position us for epc assignments 
our engineering operations are currently at capacity  constrained by the availability of qualified personnel 
we believe our locations in tulsa  oklahoma and salt lake city  utah protect us to some degree from the high turnover of technical employees characteristic in energy centers such as houston  texas 
we believe this high level of engineering activity has been the precursor to higher levels of construction activity in north america 
our backlog at december  of million for continuing operations reflects the growth of work under contract from million at december  our discussions with potential customers and our recent awards regarding pipeline and station construction projects in north america  coupled with the increase in engineering assignments  reinforce our belief that our ability to obtain improved terms and conditions and better pricing will continue in and we believe customers recognize the imbalance in the supply and demand for pipeline engineering and construction  and will offer better terms and conditions  resulting in lower risk to us  to control pricing increases for our services 
demand in the united states and canada market  led the improvement in backlog from continuing operations in  and we believe the demand there will continue to be strong 
we also expect the international market to continue to expand and exhibit strengthening demand as new energy infrastructure developments are contemplated in north africa and the middle east  markets of focus for us 
financing transactions also on october   we concluded two financing transactions that were required to support our expected growth 
willbros usa  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  entered into a new  three year senior secured synthetic credit facility the credit facility with a group of lenders led by calyon new york branch calyon 
concurrent with the creation of the credit facility  the predecessor credit facility was terminated and a total of  of outstanding letters of credit was reissued under the credit facility 
at december   the credit facility had availability of  and is scheduled to expire in october the company may elect to increase the total capacity under the credit facility to  with consent from calyon 
borrowings have not taken place  nor is it the company s intent to use the credit facility for future borrowings 
the credit facility was established to provide a source of letters of credit 
also on october   the company sold  shares of its common stock in a private placement the private placement 
the selling price was per share which was a discount of approximately percent based on the company s closing stock price of on october  net proceeds after estimated transaction costs were  net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes primarily to support the start up of several new projects in the united states and canada 
see liquidity and capital resources below for additional information the credit facility and the private placement

index to financial statements significant business developments during and through february  we were awarded multiple projects valued at approximately  significant project awards announced were as follows willbros engineers  inc wei executed an epc contract with guardian pipeline  llc to provide services for the guardian expansion and extension project 
the guardian expansion and extension project will involve constructing miles of inch and inch natural gas pipeline from the terminus of the existing guardian pipeline near ixonia  wisconsin  to the green bay area 
eight associated meter stations and two  horsepower compressor stations  one located in dekalb county  illinois  and the other in walworth county  wisconsin  will also be constructed 
wei s scope of work currently includes the pipeline and the meter stations 
wei was also awarded an epc contract by cheniere sabine pass pipeline company cheniere  a wholly owned subsidiary of cheniere energy  inc under the epc agreement  which is effective as of february   willbros will provide cheniere with services for the management  engineering  material procurement  construction and construction management of the mile  inch pipeline and related facilities to be constructed from cheniere s liquefied natural gas terminal being constructed at sabine pass to a pipeline interconnect at johnson s bayou  all located in cameron parish  louisiana 
wei and cheniere are entering into the epc agreement sufficiently in advance of commencement of physical construction of the pipeline in order to perform detailed engineering and procure materials 
construction is scheduled to commence in april and to be completed in september willbros rpi  inc  was awarded the installation of miles of inch natural gas pipeline in north louisiana from centerpoint energy 
this work consists of the eastern two loops of centerpoint s planned mile  inch pipeline from carthage  texas to its perryville hub in northeast louisiana 
the project commenced in the fourth quarter of and completion is scheduled for the second quarter of the oman construction company toco  received a contract to perform additional maintenance activities and small capital projects for occidental of oman inc the duration of the assignment is expected to span the next to years  with an option to renew for an additional to years 
willbros rpi  inc  in february was awarded a contract with southeast supply header  llc sesh  a joint venture between subsidiaries of spectra energy corp and centerpoint energy inc nyse cnp  to construct approximately miles of the sesh project  consisting of inch and inch diameter pipeline 
sesh will begin near the perryville hub in northeast louisiana and will interconnect with the gulfstream natural gas system  llc pipeline in mobile county  alabama 
construction of the project is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of and to be completed in the summer of financial summary for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of  or per share on revenue of  this compares to a net loss from continuing operations of  or per share on revenue of  in our revenue was up percent from  primarily driven by improving market conditions in the united states canada business segment 
see note segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional information regarding segment reporting 
following are the key components of the increase in revenue commencement of work on new engineering and pipeline construction projects in the united states  and expansion of work relating to maintenance and fabrication contracts in the canadian oil sands

the company recognized  of income tax expense on a loss for continuing operations of  this was an increase of compared to due to expenses of  occurring in panama where no tax benefit is obtained  the company incurred a tax expense on a loss from continuing operations 
permanent timing differences in the us also contributed to a higher effective tax rate 
cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  at december   from  at december  the decrease resulted primarily from the cash consumed in our discontinued operations of  and capital expenditures of  the decrease was partially offset by cash generated from continuing operations investing activities of  and financing activities of  long term debt increased to  in from  in primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of  of notes and an increase in capital lease obligations of  discontinued operations as discussed above in general  we sold our nigeria operations on february  the decision to sell our nigeria operations was the result of the following in nigeria we continued to see the spread and escalation of hostilities against oil and gas installations and the work forces charged with construction  maintenance and operation of those installations 
the attacks by militants directly and indirectly affected the company on a continuous basis since the hostage taking incident of february  however  since mid june  the situation in nigeria worsened  with attacks increasing throughout the country 
additional production operations in the delta area have been and remain  shut in 
these disruptions have had the combined effect of supporting higher oil prices and either frustrating projects or creating a force majeure event for our ongoing projects in nigeria 
in the current work environment  with the nigeria government and local operating companies unable to provide the security necessary for us to conduct project operations  our project activities were frustrated and we could not expose our personnel on an ongoing basis to the very real and escalating threat posed by these militant and hostile community disturbances 
further  there existed the ongoing possibility that labor unrest could escalate into violence at the choba facility due to a continuing labor dispute over a new may labor agreement 
in late september  violence in the port harcourt area escalated to the point where we elected to transfer employees out of this area to ensure their continued safety 
we subsequently reduced our choba facility staff to a minimum number required to support a caretaker status 
critical ongoing support functions were shifted to lagos and other locations outside the port harcourt area 
discontinued operations reported an  net loss or loss per share for the year ended december  net loss from discontinued operations were almost entirely attributable to our nigeria operations which reported an  net loss for the operating results in nigeria for were negatively impacted by schedule delays  increasing costs related to labor  equipment  materials  and security  disputes with clients related to change orders  and the lack of revenue on certain projects due to force majeure 
additionally during the process of selling our nigeria operations  we incurred costs to protect the value of our franchise in nigeria by continuing to qualify for future projects and by maintaining a certain level of workforce 
during  discontinued operations consumed  of cash in its operating and investing activities primarily due to the net loss generated by the company s nigeria operations

index to financial statements additional financial disclosures on discontinued operations are provided in note discontinuance of operations and asset disposal in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
the remainder of management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations pertains only to continuing operations unless noted otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue a number of factors relating to the company s business affect the recognition of contract revenue 
the company typically structures contracts as fixed price  unit price  time and material or cost plus fixed fee 
revenue from unit price and time and material contracts is recognized as earned 
the company believes that its operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized 
revenue for fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
under this method  estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs  taking into consideration physical completion 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling  the unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  client needs  client delays in providing permits and approvals  labor availability  governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project s completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition 
the company does not recognize income on a fixed price contract until the contract is approximately percent to percent complete  depending upon the nature of the contract 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
the company considers unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which the company has customer approval for scope change  but not for price associated with that scope change 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
the company recognizes revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved changed orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than the company s cost related to the unapproved change order 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on the balance sheet 
unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in the future reporting periods to reflect the changes in estimates or final agreement with customers 
the company considers claims to be amounts the company seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes by the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
the provision or benefit for income taxes and the annual effective tax rate are impacted by income 
table of contents 
index to financial statements taxes in certain countries being computed based on a deemed income rather than on taxable income and tax holidays on certain international projects 
other financial measures backlog in our industry  backlog is considered an indicator of potential future performance because it represents a portion of the future revenue stream 
our strategy is not focused solely on backlog additions but  capturing quality backlog with margins commensurate with the risks associated with a given project 
backlog consists of anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts and contracts whose award is reasonably assured 
at december   total backlog from continuing and discontinued operations was  compared to  at december  backlog for continuing operations at december  and was  and  respectively  a percent increase 
we believe the backlog figures are firm  subject only to the cancellation and modification provisions contained in various contracts 
we expect that approximately million or about percent  of our existing total backlog at december   will be recognized in revenue during historically  a substantial amount of our revenue in a given year has not been in our backlog at the beginning of that year 
additionally  due to the short duration of many jobs  revenue associated with jobs performed within a reporting period will not be reflected in backlog 
we generate revenue from numerous sources  including contracts of long or short duration entered into during a year as well as from various contractual processes  including change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and the effect of escalation or currency fluctuation formulas 
these revenue sources are not added to backlog until realization is assured 
the following table shows our backlog by operating segment and geographic region as of december  and amount percent amount percent backlog united states canada united states canada international middle east total  continuing operations discontinued operations total backlog ebitda from continuing operations we use ebitda earnings before net interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization as part of our overall assessment of financial performance by comparing ebitda between accounting periods 
we believe that ebitda is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in businesses similar to ours 
ebitda from continuing operations for was as compared to  in the  increase in ebitda is primarily the result of increased contract income of  partially offset by increased g a expense of  including severance costs of  a reconciliation of ebitda to gaap financial information can be found in item selected financial data of this form k

year ended december  of revenue of revenue increase decrease percent change united states canada international total contract income united states canada contract income increased  primarily due to increased revenue in the segment while contract margin percent declined by percentage points 
the decline in the contract margin percent is due to lower contract margin in canada due to start up costs associated with the new fabrication facility and costs overruns on certain construction projects 
these declines in contract margin were partially offset by higher contract margins on engineering and pipeline construction projects in the united states 
international contract income decreased  primarily due to declines in contract income in iraq  bolivia and ecuador as projects in these countries were completed or closed out in the decline in the contract margin percent resulted from the high margin recognized from the completed iraq project and the benefit from the bolivia transierra project claim settlement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk is our exposure to changes in non us currency exchange rates 
we attempt to negotiate contracts which provide for payment in us dollars  but we may be required to take all or a portion of payment under a contract in another currency 
to mitigate non us currency exchange risk  we seek to match anticipated non us currency revenue with expense in the same currency whenever possible 
to the extent we are unable to match non us currency revenue with expense in the same currency  we may use forward contracts  options or other common hedging techniques in the same non us currencies 
we had no forward contracts or options at december  and the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  notes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value at december  due to the generally short maturities of these items 
at december   we invested primarily in short term dollar denominated bank deposits 
we have the ability and expect to hold our investments to maturity 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our borrowings under the credit facility 
at december   there were no borrowings under the credit facility subject to variable interest rates 
at december   our fixed rate debt approximated fair value based upon discounted future cash flows using current market rates
