reverse acquisition of telewest on march   ntl merged with a subsidiary of telewest and the merger has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of telewest using the purchase method 
in connection with this transaction  telewest changed its name to ntl incorporated  and has since changed its name to virgin media inc the total purchase price was billion  including cash of billion  common stock valued at billion  stock options with a fair value of million and estimated direct transaction costs of million

the cash proceeds from the sale were billion 
our broadcast operations provided site leasing  broadcast transmission  satellite  media  public safety communications and other network services  utilizing broadcast transmission infrastructure  wireless communications and other facilities

financial information for all prior periods presented in this report is restated accordingly 
the results of operations for the broadcast and ireland operations have been excluded from the components of loss from continuing operations and shown in a separate caption  titled income from discontinued operations 
factors affecting our business cable segment our cable segment residential customers account for the majority of our total revenue 
the number of residential customers  the number and types of services that each customer uses and the prices we charge for these services drive our revenue 
our profit is driven by the relative margins on the types of services we provide to these customers and by the number of services that we provide to them 
for example  broadband internet is more profitable than our television services and  on average  our triple play customers are more profitable than double play or single play customers 
our packaging of services and our pricing are designed to encourage our customers to use multiple services such as television  telephone and broadband at a lower price than each stand alone product on a combined basis 
factors particularly affecting our profitability include customer churn  average revenue per user arpu  competition  the success of our integration efforts  capital expenditures  currency movements and seasonality 
customer churn 
customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop using our services 
an increase in our customer churn can lead to increased costs and reduced revenue 
we continue to focus on improving our customer service and enhancing and expanding our service offerings to existing customers in an effort to manage our customer churn rate 
our ability to reduce our customer churn rate beyond a base level is limited by factors like customers moving outside our network service area  in particular during the summer season 
managing our customer churn rate is a significant component of our business plan 
our customer churn rate may increase if our customer service is seen as unsatisfactory  if we are unable to deliver our services over our network without interruption  or if we fail to match offerings by our competitors 
cable arpu 
average revenue per user  or arpu  is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing potential revenue from customers 
we believe that our triple play cable offering of television  broadband and fixed line telephone services is attractive to our existing customer base and allows us to increase our cable arpu by facilitating the sale of multiple services to each customer 
cable arpu excludes any recognition of revenue from our mobile segment 
with the acquisition of virgin mobile we are now able to offer quad play of television  broadband  mobile and fixed line telephone services  which we believe will enhance our competitiveness and growth opportunities 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant competition in the market for our consumer services  including broadband and telephone services offered by british telecom bt and resellers or local loop unbundlers  alternative internet access services like dsl  satellite television services offered by british sky broadcasting group plc bskyb  digital terrestrial television offered through freeview  internet protocol television offered by tiscali spa tiscali and bt  and mobile telephone services offered by other mobile telephone operators 
our business services also face a range of competitors  including bt and cable wireless 
certain competitors  such as bt and bskyb  are dominant in markets in which we compete and may use their dominance in those markets to offer bundled services that include two or more of our product offerings 
if competitive forces prevent us from charging the prices for these services that we plan to charge  or if our competition is able to attract our customers or potential customers we are targeting  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
integration 
we are presently integrating our legacy ntl and telewest cable businesses 
this involves the incurrence of substantial operating and capital expenditures and  in some cases  involves the outsourcing of key functions in an effort to achieve synergies through the integration of the two businesses 
for example  we are consolidating our billing platforms over the next twelve months 
while these integration efforts are presently on track  any issues that may arise in connection with our integration could have a material negative effect on our financial performance 
capital expenditures 
our business requires substantial capital expenditures on a continuing basis for various purposes  including expanding  maintaining and upgrading our network  investing in new customer acquisitions  and offering new services 
if we do not continue to invest in our network and in new technologies  our ability to retain and acquire customers may be hindered 
therefore  our liquidity and the availability of cash to fund capital projects are important drivers of our revenue 
when our liquidity is restricted  so is our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
currency movements 
we encounter currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenue and operating costs are earned and paid primarily in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our existing indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
we have implemented a hedging program to seek to mitigate the risk from these exposures 
the objective of this program is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying rates 
seasonality 
some revenue streams are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  telephone usage revenue by customers and businesses tends to be slightly lower during summer holiday months 
our customer churn rates include persons who disconnect their service because of moves  resulting in a seasonal increase in our churn rates during the summer months when higher levels of uk house moves occur and students leave their accommodations between academic years 
mobile segment competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant competition in our markets from mobile operators  including o  vodafone  orange  t mobile and  and from other mobile virtual network operators  including tesco mobile  bt mobile and carphone warehouse 
many of our competitors are part of large multinational groups  have substantial advertising and marketing budgets  and have a significant retail presence 
if competitive forces prevent us from charging the prices for these services that we plan to charge  or if our competition is able to attract our customers or potential customers we are targeting  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
seasonality 
some revenue streams and cost drivers are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  in the fourth quarter of each year our customer acquisition and retention costs typically increase due to the christmas period 
our arpu generally decreases in the first quarter of each year due to the fewer number of days in february and lower usage after the christmas period 
distribution 
we rely upon third parties to distribute our mobile products and services 
if any of these distribution partners were to cease to act as distributors for our products and services  or the commissions or other costs charged by the third parties were to increase  our ability to gain new customers or retain existing customers may be adversely affected 
content segment competition 
our television programming competes with other broadcasters for advertising revenues  subscription revenues  and programming rights 
sit up competes with a large variety of retailers in the uk market and with other television channels for audiences 
limited number of buyers with market power 
other than our own cable segment  the primary buyer of our television channels is bskyb 
bskyb has recently used its market power to reduce  and in some cases  eliminate the fees that it pays us to carry our channels 
this is expected to reduce our content segment revenues in by approximately million 
access to content 
some of the television program content is purchased  mainly from the us because there is a limited supply of content available and an increasing number of digital channels in the uk  virgin media tv may experience an increase in the cost of programming 
seasonality 
our content segment incurs increased costs in the fourth quarter of each year due to the need to provide enhanced programming over the important christmas holiday period 
also  sit up generally records increased revenues and costs in the fourth quarter due to generally higher retail sales in the lead up to the christmas holiday 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported  as well as disclosures about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the following critical accounting policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements 
an impact could occur because of the significance of the financial statement item to which these policies relate  or because these policies require more judgment and estimation than other matters owing to the uncertainty related to measuring  at a specific point in time  transactions that are continuous in nature 
these policies may need to be revised in the future in the event that changes to our business occur 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts and customer lists  the trademark s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s assumptions about fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur  which may affect management s estimates 
other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in particular  liabilities in relation to tax exposures or liabilities to restructure the pre acquisition businesses of ntl  telewest and virgin mobile  including the exit of properties and termination of employees  are subject to change as management completes its assessment of pre merger operations and begins to execute the approved plan for the integration of the three companies 
impairment of long lived assets and indefinite lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives to be held and used by an entity are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
indications of impairment are determined by reviewing undiscounted projected future cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
goodwill arising from business combinations  reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to annual review for impairment or more frequently should indications of impairment arise 
impairment of goodwill and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets is determined using a two step approach  initially based on a comparison of the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value  if the fair value is lower than the carrying value  then the second step compares the asset s fair value implied fair value for goodwill and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets with its carrying value to measure the amount of the impairment 
impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives is determined based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value 
any excess of carrying value over fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 
we evaluate our cable reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as at december  while all other reporting units are evaluated as at june in the future  we may incur impairment charges under sfas no 
if market values decline and we do not achieve expected cash flow growth rates 
estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows and those estimates include inherent uncertainties  including those relating to the timing and amount of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation 
assumptions used in these cash flows are consistent with our internal forecasts 
if actual results differ from the assumptions used in the impairment review  we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
income taxes our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  income tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
from time to time  we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to some uncertainty 
examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals  issues related to consideration paid or received in connection with acquisitions  and certain financing transactions 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
at each period end  it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including  but not limited to the expected operating income or loss for the year  projections of the proportion of income or loss earned and taxed in the united kingdom and the extent to which this income or loss may also be taxed in the united states  permanent and temporary differences  the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain tax positions taken in respect to matters such as business acquisitions and disposals and certain financing transactions including intercompany transactions  amongst others  and we accrue a liability when we believe an assessment may be probable and the amount is estimable 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the impact of revisions to these estimates are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes have and will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and our tax environment changes 
fixed assets labor and overhead costs directly related to the construction and installation of fixed assets  including payroll and related costs of some employees and related rent and other occupancy costs  are capitalized 
the payroll and related costs of some employees that are directly related to construction and installation activities are capitalized based on specific time devoted to these activities where identifiable 
in cases where the time devoted to these activities is not specifically identifiable  we capitalize costs based upon estimated allocations 
costs associated with initial customer installations are capitalized 
the costs of reconnecting the same service to a previously installed premise are charged to expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we assign fixed assets and intangible assets useful lives that impact the annual depreciation and amortization expense 
the assignment of useful lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
our managers use their experience and expertise in applying judgments about appropriate estimates 
changes in technology or changes in intended use of these assets may cause the estimated useful life to change  resulting in higher or lower depreciation charges or asset impairment charges 
restructuring costs as of january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or fas  and recognize a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities when the liability is incurred 
the adoption of fas did not have a significant effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
prior to  we recognized a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities at the time a commitment to restructure was given  in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
liabilities for costs associated with restructuring activities initiated prior to january  continue to be accounted for under eitf in relation to our restructuring activities  we have recorded a liability of million as of december  relating to lease exit costs of properties that we have vacated 
in calculating the liability  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including the timing of ultimate disposal of the properties  our ability to sublet the properties either in part or as a whole  amounts of sublet rental income achievable including any incentives required to be given to sublessees  and amounts of lease termination costs 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations fsp 
the fasb issued the fsp to address the accounting for certain obligations associated with the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive adopted by the european union eu 
fsp requires that the commercial user should apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
and the related fasb interpretation no 
to certain obligations associated with historical waste as defined by the directive  since this type of obligation is an asset retirement obligation 
the fsp is effective for the later of the first reporting period ending after june  or the directive s adoption into law by the applicable eu member country 
the directive was adopted by the uk on december   and is effective january  management have reviewed their obligations under the law and concluded that an obligation exists for certain of our customer premises equipment 
as a result we have recognized a retirement obligation of million and fixed assets of million on the balance sheet and a cumulative effect change in accounting principle of million in the statement of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  if there are changes in net assets as a result of application of fin these will be accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we adopted fin effective january  we are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting fin  but do not anticipate any significant impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and we are required to adopt it in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and are not yet in a position to determine its effects 
in september  the sec issued sab no  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of a company s balance sheet and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations from continuing operations years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   revenue increased by to  million from  million for this increase is primarily due to the reverse acquisition of telewest and the inclusion of its revenues from march   and to the acquisition of virgin mobile and the inclusion of its revenues from july  cable arpu has increased steadily through the year  reflecting our drive to encourage triple play bundling and a focus on better quality customers 
our focus on acquiring new bundled customers and on cross selling to existing customers is shown by revenue generating units rgus per customer increasing from at december  to at december  and by the percentage of our customers with triple play growing from at december  to at december  these increases arise primarily because the number of rgus per customer and the percentage of customers with triple play were higher in the legacy telewest business than in ntl 
expenses operating costs 
for the year ended december   operating costs  including network expenses  increased by to  million from million during the same period in this increase is primarily attributable to the reverse acquisition of telewest and to the acquisition of virgin mobile 
operating costs as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december   from for the same period in  in part due to the inclusion of the telewest content segment subsequent to the reverse acquisition of telewest and the new mobile segment subsequent to the acquisition of virgin mobile  since these segments have lower margins than our cable segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million for the same period in this increase is primarily attributable to the reverse acquisition of telewest and to the acquisition of virgin mobile 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to for the year ended december   from for the same period in  partly due to costs incurred in connection with the integration of ntl and telewest and increased stock based compensation expense offset by savings from lower employee related costs as a result of involuntary employee terminations in the year ended december  in january  we began the extensive marketing campaign behind our new virgin media rebrand 
we expect this to increase our normal marketing and advertising costs by over million in other charges other charges of million in the year ended december  relate primarily to employee termination costs and lease exit costs in connection with our restructuring programs initiated in respect of the reverse acquisition of telewest 
the following table summarizes our historical restructuring provisions in millions historical restructuring provisions involuntary employee termination and related costs lease exit costs total balance  january  charged to expense utilized balance  december  the following table summarizes our restructuring provisions resulting primarily from the reverse acquisition of telewest in millions acquisition restructuring provisions involuntary employee termination and related costs lease exit costs total balance  january  provisions resulting from business acquisition recognized under eitf charged to expense utilized balance  december  depreciation expense for the year ended december   depreciation expense increased to million from million for the same period in this increase is primarily attributable to the reverse acquisition of telewest and related fair value adjustment to the property and equipment acquired  and to the acquisition of virgin mobile 
excluding the impact of the reverse acquisition of telewest and of the acquisition of virgin mobile  depreciation expense has decreased due to the absence of depreciation on some assets that became fully depreciated in amortization expense for the year ended december   amortization expense increased to million from million for the same period in the increase in amortization expense relates to additional intangible assets arising from the reverse acquisition of telewest and from the acquisition of virgin mobile 
interest income and other for the year ended december   interest income and other increased to million from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased interest rates and additional cash balances throughout the year 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense increased to million from million for the same period in  primarily as a result of the additional borrowing as a result of the reverse acquisition of telewest and the acquisition of virgin mobile 
we paid cash interest of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the increase in cash interest payments resulted from the effects of the new senior credit facility and senior bridge facility in respect of the reverse acquisition of telewest and the acquisition of virgin mobile  and changes in timing of interest payments 
loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   loss on extinguishment of debt was million  and relates primarily to the write off of deferred financing costs on the senior credit facility that was repaid upon completion of the refinancing of the reverse acquisition of telewest 
for the year ended december   loss on extinguishment of debt was million  and related to the redemption of the million floating rate senior notes due on july  foreign currency transaction gains losses for the year ended december   foreign currency transaction losses were million as compared with gains of million for the foreign currency losses in the year ended december  were largely comprised of foreign exchange losses of million on us dollar forward purchase contracts that were entered into to hedge the repayment of the us dollar denominated bridge facility 
the repayment of billion of this facility on june  resulted in an offsetting gain during the period of million that has been recorded as a component of equity 
the foreign currency transaction gains in the year ended december  include gains of million on the forward rate contracts and collars taken out in december in connection with billion of the expected cash purchase price of telewest offset by losses on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated long term debt and related forward contracts 
our results of operations will continue to be affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations since million of our indebtedness is denominated in us dollars and million is denominated in euros 
gain from derivative instruments the gain from derivative instruments of million in the year ended december   mainly relates to favorable movements in the fair value of sterling interest rate swaps 
income tax benefit for the year ended december   income tax benefit was million as compared with income tax expense of million for the same period in the and benefit expense is composed of in millions us state and local income tax foreign tax deferred us income tax alternative minimum tax total in  we received refunds of million of the us alternative minimum tax and million of us state and local tax 
we also paid million of us federal income tax in respect of pre acquisition periods of telewest 
in addition  we paid million of uk tax expense in respect of pre acquisition periods of virgin mobile 
in  we paid million of the us alternative minimum tax 
loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   loss from continuing operations was million compared with a loss of million for the same period in the increase in loss from continuing operations is primarily attributable to the reverse acquisition of telewest and the acquisition of virgin mobile together with the associated increases in depreciation  amortization  interest expense  foreign exchange losses and loss on extinguishment of debt partially offset by increased income from those acquisitions during the year 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fsp fas  accounting for electronic waste obligations fsp addressing the accounting for certain obligations associated with the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive adopted by the european union eu 
fsp requires that the commercial user should apply its provisions to certain obligations associated with historical waste as defined by the directive  since this type of obligation is an asset retirement obligation 
the directive was adopted by the uk on december   and is effective january  management have reviewed their obligations under the law and have concluded that an obligation exists for certain of our customer premises equipment 
as a result we have recognized a retirement obligation of million and fixed assets of million on the balance sheet and a cumulative effect change in accounting principle of million in the consolidated statement of operations 
loss from continuing operations per share basic and diluted loss from continuing operations per common share for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  basic and diluted loss from continuing operations per share is computed using a weighted average of million shares issued in the year ended december  and a weighted average of million shares issued for the same period in options and warrants to purchase million shares at december  are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss from continuing operations per share  since the inclusion of such options and warrants is anti dilutive 
segment information a description of the products and services  as well as year to date financial data  for each segment can be found below in note to virgin media s consolidated financial statements 
the segment results for the year ended december  included in our consolidated financial statements are reported on an actual basis and include the results of telewest from march  and the results of virgin mobile from july  the results of operations of each of our cable and content segments for the years ended december  and are reported in this section on a pro forma combined basis as if the reverse acquisition of telewest had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented and combine telewest s historical content and sit up segments into the combined company s content segment 
the pro forma data has been calculated on a basis consistent with the pro forma financial information filed with the securities and exchange commission under our form k a on may  we believe that a pro forma comparison of these segments is more relevant than a historic comparison as a in respect of our cable segment  the size of the acquired legacy telewest cable business would obscure any meaningful discussion of changes in our cable segment if viewed on a historical basis  and b we did not have a content segment in comparative pro forma results of our mobile segment have not been presented 
the reportable segments disclosed in this form k are based on our management organizational structure as of december  future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed 
segment operating income before depreciation  amortization and other charges  which we refer to as segment ocf  is management s measure of segment profit as permitted under sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our management  including our chief executive officer who is our chief operating decision maker  considers segment ocf as an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our segments 
segment ocf excludes the impact of costs and expenses that do not directly affect our cash flows 
other charges  including restructuring charges  are also excluded from segment ocf as management believes they are not characteristic of our underlying business operations 
cable segment the summary pro forma combined results of operations of our cable segment were as follows in millions year ended december  revenue inter segment revenue segment ocf depreciation  amortization and other charges operating loss income revenue our pro forma cable segment revenue by customer type for the years ended december  and was as follows in millions year ended december  increase decrease revenue consumer business total revenue consumer for year ended december   pro forma revenue from residential customers increased by to  million from  million for the year ended december  this increase is driven largely by growth in the number of broadband internet subscribers together with television and telephony price rises partially offset by lower telephony usage 
cable arpu has increased steadily through the year  reflecting our drive to encourage triple play bundling and a focus on better quality customers 
our focus on acquiring new bundled customers and on cross selling to existing customers is shown by revenue generating units rgus per customer increasing from on a pro forma basis at december  to at december  and by triple play penetration growing from on a pro forma basis at december  to at december  business for the year ended december   pro forma revenue from business customers decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to declines in telephony voice revenue and lower wholesale and other revenues  partially offset by greater data installation and rental revenue 
cable segment ocf for the year ended december   pro forma cable segment ocf decreased by to  million from  million for the year ended december  the decrease in ocf is primarily due to increased selling  general and administrative expenses  which included pre acquisition charges of million relating to the reverse acquisition of telewest  consisting of legal and professional charges of million and executive compensation costs and insurance expenses of million  together with integration costs incurred since the acquisition 
summary cable statistics selected statistics for residential cable customers of virgin media  excluding customers off our network and virgin mobile customers  for the three months ended december  as well as the four prior quarters  are set forth in the table below

data cleanse activity in q is a result of more closely aligning customer definitions between ntl and telewest together with the removal of approximately  inactive backlog customers in ntl 
data cleanse activity in q resulted in a decrease in ntl of  customers and  rgus  a decrease of approximately  telephone   broadband and an increase of  net tv rgus 
review of inactive backlog customers in the three months ended december  resulted in an adjustment to remove an additional  customers 
customer churn is calculated by taking the total disconnects during the month and dividing them by the average number of customers during the month 
average monthly churn during a quarter is the average of the three monthly churn calculations within the quarter 
each telephone  television and broadband internet subscriber directly connected to our network counts as one rgu 
accordingly  a subscriber who receives both telephone and television service counts as two rgus 
rgus may include subscribers receiving some services for free or at a reduced rate in connection with incentive offers 
dial up internet customers exclude metered customers who have not used the service within the last days

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million of debt outstanding  compared to  million as of september  and  million as of december   and million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million as of september  and million as of december  the increase in debt since the previous year is primarily attributable to the reverse acquisition of telewest in march and the acquisition of virgin mobile in july our business is capital intensive  we are highly leveraged  and we have historically incurred operating losses and negative cash flow  partly as a result of our construction costs  operating expenditures and interest costs 
we require significant amounts of capital to connect customers to our network  expand and upgrade our network  offer new services and integrate our billing systems and customer databases 
we must also regularly service interest payments with cash flows from operations 
our ability to sustain operations  meet financial covenants under our indebtedness  and make required payments on our indebtedness could be impaired if we are unable to maintain or achieve various financial performance measures 
our ability to service our capital needs  to service our obligations under our indebtedness and to fund our ongoing operations will depend upon our ability to generate cash 
although we expect to generate positive cash flow in the future  we cannot be certain that this will be the case 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with cash from operations and undrawn credit facility  will be sufficient for our cash requirements through to at least december  however  our cash requirements after december  may exceed these sources of cash 
this may require that we obtain additional financing in excess of the financing incurred in the recent refinancing transaction 
we may not be able to obtain financing at all  or on favorable terms  or we may be contractually prevented by the terms of our senior notes or our senior credit facility from incurring additional indebtedness 
we are a holding company with no independent operations or significant assets other than our investments in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we will depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
in addition  the terms of our and our subsidiaries existing and future indebtedness and the laws of the jurisdictions under which those subsidiaries are organized limit the payment of dividends  loan repayments and other distributions to us under many circumstances 
our debt agreements and the debt agreements of some of our subsidiaries contain restrictions on our ability to transfer cash between groups of our subsidiaries 
as a result of these restrictions  although our overall liquidity may be sufficient to satisfy our obligations  we may be limited by covenants in some of our debt agreements from transferring cash to other subsidiaries that might require funds 
in addition  cross default provisions in our other indebtedness may be triggered if we default on any of these debt agreements

as of december   interest is determined on a variable basis on billion  or  of our long term debt 
an increase in interest rates of would increase our interest expense by million per year  before giving effect to hedges 
we are also subject to currency exchange rate risks  because substantially all of our revenues and operating expenses are paid in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  like foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
as some of our indebtedness accrues interest at variable rates  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with variable interest rate payments 
also  substantially all of our revenues and operating costs are earned and paid in pounds sterling but we pay interest and principal obligations on some of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros

as a result  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with changes in foreign exchange rates on payments of principal and interest on a portion of our indebtedness 
to mitigate the risk from these exposures  we have implemented a cash flow hedging program 
the objective of this program is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying rates 
to achieve this objective we have entered into a number of derivative instruments 
the derivative instruments utilized comprise interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts
