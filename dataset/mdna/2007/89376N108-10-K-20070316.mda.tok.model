item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
transportation and marketing oil producers in the area of the south alibek field utilize both the kaztrans oil and russian transneft pipeline systems to export crude oil to regional hub locations such as samara  ukraine  the port of odessa on the black sea  the port of primorsk on the baltic sea and european locations such as poland  hungry  lithuania  germany and finland 
pipeline capacity in the area has significantly increased with the opening of the caspian pipeline consortium cpc pipeline  which ultimately will boost regional export capacity from  barrels of oil per day to an expected  barrels of oil per day 
two soviet era oil pipelines in the local area of the field  with combined capacity of  barrels of oil per day  continue to service nearby producing fields 
these pipelines transport oil to the bestamak rail terminal and the oil refinery in orsk via kenkiyak field  and can be used as a transfer point for oil exchanges to western markets 
several rail loading oil terminals are also in the area and can be used for export sales 
the nearest is the zhem terminal  which lies approximately miles from the south alibek field near the city of emba 
two important connecting pipelines in the vicinity of the south alibek field became operational in the kenkiyak atyrau pipeline  with an initial capacity of  barrels of oil per day  originates at the kenkiyak field and provides a link to the cpc pipeline for nearby producing fields  including the zhanazhol field 
the alibekmola kenkiyak pipeline  operated by kaztransoil  provides direct pipeline access from the alibekmola field to the kenkiyak atyrau pipeline for export to western markets via the cpc pipeline 
the pump station at the alibekmola field is one mile from the site of our central production facilities 
prior to march  we exported our oil exclusively by rail from various terminals 
the rail terminals are accessed by truck from our field facilities 
pipeline shipments  which are the preferred and most cost effective method of accessing the export market  began in march  with first sales expected in april the oil is being shipped through the alibekmola kenkiyak pipeline  using the treatment and export facilities of a third party 
we expect this arrangement to alleviate the logistical problems we have experienced with the trucking rail

a portion of our oil continues to be sold in the local markets due to storage constraints of the existing field facilities 
we anticipate the completion of the initial phase of our central production facility in april and the installation of our own demercaptan unit in august  after which we will be able to export directly into the pipeline without using third party facilities and incurring a processing fee
