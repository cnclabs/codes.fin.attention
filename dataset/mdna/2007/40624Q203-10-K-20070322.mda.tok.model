critical accounting estimates and judgments the significant accounting policies requiring our estimates and judgments are discussed below 
such estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  changes in laws and regulations  observance of industry trends and information received from third parties 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  we believe the estimates and judgments associated with the reported consolidated financial statement amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
for additional discussion of our accounting policies  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
valuation of investments 
we complete a detailed analysis each quarter to assess whether any decline in the fair value of any investment below cost is deemed other than temporary 
all securities with an unrealized loss are reviewed 
unless other factors cause us to reach a contrary conclusion  investments with a fair market value significantly less than cost for more than days are deemed to have a decline in value that is other than temporary 
a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary is charged to earnings based on the fair value of the security at the time of assessment  resulting in a new cost basis for the security 
risks and uncertainties are inherent in our other than temporary decline in value assessment methodology 
risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions about financial condition or liquidity  incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions about future prospects  unfavorable changes in economic or social conditions and unfavorable changes in interest rates or credit ratings 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
policy acquisition costs mainly commission  underwriting and marketing expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred and charged to operations over periods in which the related premiums are earned 
ceding commissions from reinsurers  which include expense allowances  are deferred and recognized over the period premiums are earned for the underlying policies reinsured 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
a premium deficiency exists if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and expected investment income on those unearned premiums  as computed on a product line basis 
we routinely evaluate the realizability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
at december  and  there was no premium deficiency related to deferred policy acquisition costs 
goodwill 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately million 
this amount has been recorded as a result of prior business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which we adopted as of january   goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
we completed our last annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of and determined that there was no indication of impairment 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
methods for estimating reporting unit values include market quotations  asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues 
with the exception of market quotations  all of these methods involve significant estimates and assumptions 
deferred tax assets 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
deferred federal income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end 
deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method  whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for tax rate changes 
a valuation allowance is provided against our deferred tax assets to the extent that we do not believe it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be adequate to realize these future tax benefits 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are established for claims which have already been incurred by the policyholder but which we have not yet paid 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through each balance sheet date 
the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses 
these reserves are revised periodically and are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency 
see  item business analysis of losses and lae and analysis of loss and lae reserve development 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are adequate 
due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  the actual ultimate amounts may differ from the recorded amounts 
a small percentage change could result in a material effect on reported earnings 
for example  a change in december  reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses would have produced a million change to pretax earnings 
the estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known 
such adjustments are included in current operations 
an actuarial range of ultimate unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is developed independent of management s best estimate and is only used to check the reasonableness of that estimate 
there is no exclusive method for determining this range  and judgment enters into the process 
the primary actuarial technique utilized is a loss development analysis in which ultimate losses are projected based upon historical development patterns 
the primary assumption underlying this loss development analysis is that the historical development patterns will be a reasonable predictor of the future development of losses for accident years which are less mature 
an alternate actuarial technique  known as the bornhuetter ferguson method  combines an analysis of loss development patterns with an initial estimate of expected losses or loss ratios 
this approach is most useful for recent accident years 
in addition to assuming the stability of loss development patterns  this technique is heavily de pendent on the accuracy of the initial estimate of expected losses or loss ratios 
consequently  the bornhuetter ferguson method is primarily used to confirm the results derived from the loss development analysis 
the range of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses estimated by our actuary as of december  was million to million 
our best estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of december  is million 
our carried reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of december  is comprised of million in case reserves and million in incurred but not reported reserves 
in setting this estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  we have assumed  among other things  that current trends in loss frequency and severity will continue and that the actuarial analysis was empirically valid 
in the absence of any specific factors indicating actual experience at either extreme of the actuarial range  we have established a best estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses which is approximately million higher than the midpoint of the actuarial range 
it would be expected that management s best estimat e would move within the actuarial range from year to year due to changes in our operations and changes within the marketplace 
due to the inherent uncertainty in reserve estimates  there can be no assurance that the actual losses ultimately experienced will fall within the actuarial range 
however  because of the breadth of the actuarial range  we believe that it is reasonably likely that actual losses will fall within such range 
our reserve requirements are also interrelated with product pricing and profitability 
we must price our products at a level sufficient to fund our policyholder benefits and still remain profitable 
because claim expenses represent the single largest category of our expenses  inaccuracies in the assumptions used to estimate the amount of such benefits can result in our failing to price our products appropriately and to generate sufficient premiums to fund our operations 
recognition of profit sharing commissions 
profit sharing commission is calculated and recognized when the loss ratio  as determined by a qualified actuary  deviates from contractual targets 
we receive a provisional commission as policies are produced as an advance against the later determination of the profit sharing commission actually earned 
the profit sharing commission is an estimate that varies with the estimated loss ratio and is sensitive to changes in that estimate 
the following table details the profit sharing commission revenue sensitivity of the standard commercial segment to the actual ultimate loss ratio for each effective quota share treaty at above and below the current estimate  which we believe is a reasonably likely range of variance 
treaty effective dates provisional loss ratio estimated ultimate loss ratio profit sharing commission booked at december  effect of actual above estimated loss ratio at december  effect of actual below estimated loss ratio at december  the following table details the profit sharing commission revenue sensitivity of the specialty commercial segment for the effective quota share treaty with republic at above and below the current estimate  which we believe is a reasonably likely range of variance

during fiscal  our total revenues were million  representing a increase over the million in total revenues for fiscal the acquisition of the subsidiaries included in the specialty commercial segment in the first quarter of contributed million to the increase in total revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the following table provides additional information concerning the increases in revenue contributed by these acquisitions 
year ended december  in thousands earned premium on retained business third party commission revenue investment income  finance charges and other revenue items revenue contributions from acquisitions the retention of business produced in the standard commercial segment that was previously retained by third parties also contributed million to the increase in revenue  but was partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million and lower processing and service fees of million primarily attributable to the shift from a third party agency structure to an insurance underwriting structure 
earned premium from the personal segment contributed million and additional finance charges contributed million to the increase in revenue  but were partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million and lower processing and service fees of million attributable to increased retention of the policies produced 
the investment of funds derived from the implementation of our capital plan and a trust account to secure the future guaranteed payments to the sellers of acquired subsidiaries contributed another million to revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by realized losses on our investment portfolio of million in we reported net income of million for the year ended december   which is the same as the year ended december  on a diluted per share basis  net income was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in diluted earnings per share was partially due to issuing an additional million shares during fiscal in addition  during fiscal we recorded million of interest expense from amortization attributable to the deemed discount on convertible promissory notes issued in january  and converted to common stock during the second quarter of in the absence of this non cash expense  our net income for the year ended december  would have been million representing a increase over the year ended december  the following is a reconciliation of our net income without such interest expense to our reported results 
management believes this reconciliation provides useful supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of our business 
this disclosure should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  in thousands income excluding interest expense from amortization of discount  net of tax interest expense from amortization of discount less related tax effect net income excluding the interest expense from amortization of discount  the increase in net income for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the results of the newly acquired subsidiaries of the specialty commercial segment  additional investment income and the retention of business produced by the standard commercial segment beginning in the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by i additional interest expense on borrowings to finance the acquisitions of the subsidiaries in the specialty commercial segment  ii lower results from the personal segment due primarily to favorable prior accident year loss development recognized in and the runoff of third party revenue recognized in from assuming of the texas non standard auto business beginning in the fourth quarter of  iii increased corporate operating expenses  iv realized losses on our investment portfolio and v additional income ta x due to an increase in our federal statutory rate from to in attributable to higher taxable income

net expense ratio is calculated as total underwriting expenses of our insurance company subsidiaries  including allocated overhead expenses and offset by agency fee income  divided by net premiums earned  each determined in accordance with gaap 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted the widely used industry calculation that offsets expenses with agency fee income 
all prior period comparative expense ratios have been restated 
net combined ratio is calculated as the sum of the net loss ratio and the net expense ratio 
standard commercial segment 
net written premium for the standard commercial segment was million for the year ended december   or more than the million for the year ended december  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the standard commercial segment began retaining written premium through ahic that was previously retained by third parties 
on july   the standard commercial segment assumed million of in force policies previously produced for clarendon 
the total revenue for the standard commercial segment of million for the year ended december  was million more than the million reported the prior year 
this increase in total revenue was primarily due to an increase of million in net premiums earned 
increased net investment income contributed an additional million to the increase in total revenue 
these increases were partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million primarily due to the shift from a third party agency structure to an insurance underwriting structure and also affected by lower than expected profit sharing commission 
the increase in total revenue was also partially offset by lower processing and service fees of million attributable to the change to an insurance underwriting structure 
pre tax income for the standard commercial segment of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  over the million reported for the prior year 
increased revenue  as discussed above  was the primary reason for the increase in pre tax income  partially offset by increased losses and loss adjustment expenses of million and additional operating expenses  mostly due to increased premium production  of million 
the standard commercial segment reported a net loss ratio of for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss ratio of for the prior year 
the loss ratios gross of reinsurance were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the slight decrease in the gross loss ratio was partially impacted by million of favorable reserve development from prior accident years recognized during there was no prior year reserve development recognized during the year ended december  as we began retaining this business during the third quarter of the standard commercial segment reported net expense ratios of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net expense ratio for was higher primarily due to costs to assume from clarendon the unearned premium previously produced by the standard commercial segment 
specialty commercial segment 
all of the subsidiaries included in the specialty commercial segment were acquired effective january  the million of total revenue was derived mostly from million of earned premium on produced business that was assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries and third party commission revenue of million on the portion of business produced by the specialty commercial segment that was retained by third parties 
the remaining million of revenue was primarily derived from investment income and finance charges 
pre tax income for the specialty commercial segment of million was primarily due to revenue as discussed above less i million in operating expenses  comprised mostly of commission expense and salary related expenses  ii incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses of million on the portion of business assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries  iii million of amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisitions of the subsidiaries included in the specialty commercial segment  and iv million in interest expense 
personal segment 
net premium written in the personal segment increased million during the year ended december  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in premium was due mostly to new state expansion during total revenue for the personal segment increased to million for the year ended december  from million the prior year 
higher earned premium of million and higher finance charges of million was partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million and lower processing and service fees of million due to the assumption of the texas non standard automobile premium beginning late in pre tax income for the personal segment decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the primary reason for the decline in pre tax income for the year ended december  was increased losses and loss adjustment expenses of million as evidenced by an increase in the net loss ratio to versus reported in the increase in the net loss ratio was primarily attributable to a competitive pricing environment and favorable reserve development of million recognized during as compared to million recognized during in addition  new business written as a result of new programs and expansion into new states had not yet benefited from the reduced loss ratios typically associated with renewals of seasoned business 
the increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses was partially offset by the increase in revenue discussed above 
the personal segment reported net expense ratios of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the net expense ratio was primarily a function of increased earned premium and policy fees income in without corresponding increases in expenses 
corporate 
total revenue for corporate decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to million in realized losses on our investment portfolio in this was partially offset by million in interest earned on a trust account established in the first quarter of securing the guaranteed future payments to the sellers of acquired subsidiaries 
see note  accounting policies and note  structured settlements 
corporate pre tax loss was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year 
the increased pre tax loss was primarily due to million in interest expense from amortization attributable to the deemed discount on convertible promissory notes issued in january  this interest expense had no impact on our cash flow or book value 
also contributing to the increased corporate pre tax loss was additional interest expense of million comprised of i million from the trust preferred securities issued in the second quarter of see note  notes payable  ii million of amortization of the discount on the future guaranteed payments to the sellers of acquired subsidiaries see note  structured settlements  iii million from a related party promissory note issued in january  iv million from borrowings under our revolving credit facility in january see note  notes payable and note  credit facilities  and v million from the convertible notes issued in january also contributing to the increase in pre tax loss was increased salary and related expenses of million  professional services of million  decreased revenue discussed above and travel expenses of million 
comparison of years ended december  and december  management overview 
total revenues for increased million  or  as compared to  primarily as a result of a million increase in revenues from the standard commercial segment due to the transition to ahic  beginning in the third quarter of  of commercial premium previously produced for clarendon 
income before tax for increased million over the improvement in operating earnings reflected additional investment income on capital raised in  the transition of the commercial business and improved underwriting results

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted the widely used industry calculation that offsets expenses with agency fee income 
all prior period comparative expense ratios have been restated 
net combined ratio is calculated as the sum of the net loss ratio and the net expense ratio 
standard commercial segment 
beginning in the third quarter of  the standard commercial segment began retaining written premium through ahic 
retention of this written premium was accomplished through the assumption of in force policies from clarendon at july   the assumption of clarendon policies issued subsequent to july   and the issuance of ahic policies 
this resulted in net written premium of million for total revenue for the standard commercial segment of million for was million more than the million reported in this increase in total revenue was primarily due to net premiums earned of million from the issuance of ahic policies and the assumption of premium from clarendon for business produced by this segment 
increased net investment income contributed million to the increase in revenue 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million and lower processing and service fees of million  in both cases due to the shift from a third party agency structure to an insurance underwriting structure 
total earned premium generated by the standard commercial segment for  including premium retained by clarendon  was million as compared to million for pretax income for the standard commercial segment of million for increased million  or  over the million reported for increased revenue  as discussed above  was the primary reason for the increase in pretax income  partially offset by losses and loss adjustment expenses of million and additional production expenses of million caused by increased retail agent commissions from higher premium production  as well as additional ceding commission expense from the assumption of premium from clarendon 
the standard commercial segment had a loss ratio of for the standard commercial segment had no loss ratio for because we did not retain any of the premium produced by this segment during personal segment 
net premium written by the personal segment increased million during to million compared to million during the increase was due mainly to ahic assuming of the texas non standard personal automobile business produced by this segment and underwritten by a third party  effective october  prior to october   ahic assumed only of this business 
total premium production for declined million  or  to million from the million produced in the decline in produced premium reflected increased rate competition 
revenue for the personal segment increased to million for from million for increased net premium earned of million due to higher assumed premium volume was the primary cause of this increase 
also driving the increased revenue was a million increase in investment income due to an increase in the investment portfolio from the completion of our capital plan 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in ceding commission income resulting from ahic assuming of the texas non standard personal automobile business effective october  pretax income for the personal segment increased million  or  for compared to net investment income and realized gains and losses contributed million to the increase in pretax income for over improved underwriting results  as evidenced by a loss ratio of in as compared to in  contributed million to the increase in pretax income in taking into consideration the effect on ceding commissions  losses and loss adjustment expenses and premium production costs  the changes in premium volume produced and assumed contributed approximately million to the increase in pretax income 
lower technical service costs from integrating piic s back office systems that were previously outsourced contributed million and lower salary and related expenses contributed million to the increase in pretax income 
corporate 
corporate pretax loss was million for as compared to million for the increase was due mostly to additional interest expense of million from the issuance of trust preferred securities in june  increased salary expense of million from increased headcount  including the transfer of accounting positions from both segments to corporate late in and additional audit and legal fees of million due primarily to the implementation of our capital plan in liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds our sources of funds are from insurance related operations  financing activities and investing activities

phoenix general agency paid million  million and million in management fees to hallmark during  and  respectively 
piic paid million in management fees to phoenix general agency during each of  and ahic did not pay any management fees during  or gsic did not pay any management fees during statutory capital and surplus is calculated as statutory assets less statutory liabilities 
the various state insurance departments that regulate our insurance company subsidiaries require us to maintain a minimum statutory capital and surplus 
as of december   our insurance company subsidiaries reported statutory capital and surplus of million  substantially greater than the minimum requirements for each state 
each of our insurance company subsidiaries is also required to satisfy certain risk based capital requirements 
see  item business insurance regulation risk based capital requirements 
as of december   the adjusted capital under the risk based capital calculation of each of our insurance company subsidiaries substantially exceeded the minimum requirements 
for the year ended december   our total statutory premium to surplus percentage was as compared to for the year ended december  the additional retention of produced premium was the primary cause for this increase 
comparison of december  to december  on a consolidated basis  our cash and investments  excluding restricted cash and investments  at december  were million compared to million at december  the acquisitions of the subsidiaries included in the specialty commercial segment accounted for million of this increase  while the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of the retention of business produced by both our standard commercial segment and specialty commercial segment 
comparison of years ended december  and december  net cash provided by our consolidated operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in operating cash flow primarily resulted from the retention of business produced in the standard commercial segment and specialty commercial segment in that was not retained by us in the net effect on operating cash flows was an increase of million resulting from an increase in collected premiums net of paid losses and loss adjustment expenses partially offset by lower collected commission and claim fee revenue 
increased collected commission revenue of million primarily from the acquisition of the subsidiaries included in the specialty commercial segment  increased collected investment income of million and increased collected finance charges of million primarily from the acquisition of paac were partially offset by an increase in paid operating expenses of million driven primarily from these acquisitions  additional interest paid mostly on debt financing these acquisitions of million and increased tax payments of million due to higher taxable earnings 
cash used by investing activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in cash used by investing activities was mostly due to the acquisitions of the subsidiaries included in the specialty commercial segment in the first quarter of which used million  net of cash acquired 
also contributing to the increase in cash used by investing activities was the funding of million to a trust account securing the future guaranteed payments to the sellers of acquired subsidiaries  as well as paac s million repayment of premium finance notes  net of premium finance notes originated 
partially offsetting these uses was a million increase in maturities and redemptions of investments including short term in versus  a decrease in purchases of debt and equity securities of million and a release of million from restricted cash and investments in versus million transfer red to restricted in cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the prior year

interest was payable quarterly in arrears commencing march  principal and all accrued but unpaid interest was due at maturity on july  the principal and accrued interest on the convertible notes was converted to approximately million shares of our common stock during the second quarter of structured settlements in connection with our acquisition of the subsidiaries now comprising our tga operating unit  we issued to the sellers promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of million payable million on or before january   and million on or before january  we are also obligated to pay to the sellers an additional million on or before january  and an additional million on or before january  in consideration of the sellers compliance with certain restrictive covenants  including a covenant not to compete for a period of five years after closing 
we secured payment of these future installments of purchase price and restrictive covenant consideration by depositing million in a trust account for the benefit of the sellers 
we recorded a payable for future guaranteed payments to the sellers of million discounted at  the rate of two year us treasuries purchased as the only permitted investment of the trust account 
the trust account is classified in restricted cash and investments on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the balance of the structured settlements was million 
long term contractual obligations set forth below is a summary of long term contractual obligations as of december  amounts represent estimates of gross undiscounted amounts payable over time 
in addition  certain unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are ceded to others under reinsurance contracts and are  therefore  recoverable 
such potential recoverables are not reflected in the table 
estimated payments by period total after notes payable interest on note payable structured settlements unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses operating leases purchase obligations conclusion based on budgeted and year to date cash flow information  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our projected insurance obligations  operational expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our results of operations  except for the effect that inflation may have on interest rates and claim costs 
the effects of inflation are considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on results of operations are not known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation  we are exposed to the upward trend in the judicial awards for damages 
we attempt to mitigate the effects of inflation in the pricing of policies and establishing reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that interest rate risk  credit risk and equity risk are the types of market risk to which we are principally exposed 
interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade  fixed income securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  the primary market risk exposure to these securities is interest rate risk 
in general  the fair market value of a portfolio of fixed income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in market interest rates  while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates 
the fair value of our fixed income securities as of december  was million 
the effective duration of our portfolio as of december  was years 
should interest rates increase  our fixed income investment portfolio would be expected to decline in market value by  or million  representing the effective duration multiplied by the change in market interest rates 
conversely  a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in a  or million  increase in the market value of our fixed income investment portfolio 
credit risk 
an additional exposure to our fixed income securities portfolio is credit risk 
we attempt to manage the credit risk by investing primarily in investment grade securities and limiting our exposure to a single issuer 
as of december   our fixed income investments were in the following us treasury securities  municipal securities  and corporate securities 
as of december   of our fixed income securities were rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to reinsurers to whom we have ceded underwriting risk 
although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of the coverage it assumes  we remain obligated to our policyholders in the event that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements 
in order to mitigate credit risk to reinsurance companies  we use financially strong reinsurers with an am best rating of a excellent or better 
equity price risk 
investments in equity securities which are subject to equity price risk made up of our portfolio as of december  the carrying values of equity securities are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
the fair value of our equity securities as of december  was million 
the fair value of our equity securities would increase or decrease by million assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in market prices as of the balance sheet date 
this would increase or decrease stockholders equity by 
the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what should be considered the best or worse case scenario
