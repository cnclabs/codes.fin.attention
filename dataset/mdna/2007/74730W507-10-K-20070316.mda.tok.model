financial statement overview during  we were able to effectively manage our business to improve financial performance in several of our key financial performance categories as indicated in the highlights presented below total revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in revenue was primarily due to collection of past due accounts and resolution of certain outstanding project implementation issues  the increases year over year were reflected in license revenue  maintenance revenue  and installation and other revenue  partially offset by decreases in services and hardware revenue 
gross margin increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  gross margin remained constant at in both and this was mainly attributable to increased maintenance and license revenue and lower amortization associated with acquired software  lower hardware and personnel related costs  offset in part by higher royalty and other direct costs 

table of contents income loss from operations increased from a net loss from operations of million in to net income from operations of million in the net increase resulted primarily from increased revenues and resultant gross margin  a decrease in general and administrative expenses  and the absence of additional exit costs incurred in net income loss increased from a net loss of million in to a net income of million in  mainly attributable to the increase in income from operations  an increase in interest income  and a decrease in losses from discontinued operations 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million to million at december  from million at december  cash provided by operating activities of million in  compared to million in  was offset in part by million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment  million in net purchases related to investment activity  and million of net cash used in financing activities  principally for the payment of preferred stock dividends 
days sales outstanding dso at december  was days compared to days at december  during  the company focused on the collection of outstanding receivables as a corporate initiative  which lowered outstanding receivables from million at december  to million at december  management believes that the company s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are currently effective and were effective for both reporting periods ended december  and during  the company invested significant effort and resources in eliminating the company s previously disclosed internal control deficiencies in the revenue and closing cycles and related weaknesses in disclosure controls and procedures 
these remedial actions included establishing a revenue assurance group responsible for managing ongoing quality assurance  utilizing the peoplesoft system for revenue related activities  increasing staffing  training and supervision of personnel  improving delineation of responsibilities and segregation of duties  and improving the general ledger account reconciliation and journal entry preparation and review processes 
during  the company continued to manage  monitor and improve its internal control environment to provide assurance that the requisite prevent and detect controls were in place and operating effectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies have a considerable impact on management s discussion and analysis 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant estimates and assumptions have been made regarding revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation valuation assumptions  contingencies  litigation  intangibles resulting from our purchase business combinations  charges associated with exit activities and other amounts 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
uncertainties are inherent in all of these estimates including  the estimates underlying percentage of completion accounting method of revenue recognition 
in addition  we annually review and test our estimates related to the valuations of intangibles including acquired technology  goodwill  customer lists  trademarks and other intangibles and capitalized software 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition our revenue is principally generated from three sources i licensing arrangements  ii services  and iii hardware 

table of contents our license revenue consists of fees for licenses of proprietary and third party software 
cost of license revenue primarily includes the costs of third party software and royalties  and amortization of capitalized software and acquired technology 
our service revenue consists of maintenance  software installation  customer training and consulting services related to our license revenue 
cost of services consists primarily of salaries  benefits and allocated costs related to providing such services 
hardware revenue includes third party hardware used to support our software installation 
cost of hardware revenue consists of third party equipment and installation 
we market our products through our direct sales force 
our license agreements for such products do not provide for a right of return and historically  product returns have not been significant 
we recognize revenue on our software products in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  we no longer have significant obligations with regard to implementation  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier 
revenue for arrangements with extended payment terms is recognized when the payments become due  provided all other recognition criteria are satisfied 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
specifically  we determine the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based as if sold separately and measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on hourly rates which we charge for these services when sold separately from software 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the proportion of revenue recognized upon delivery varies from quarter to quarter depending upon the mix of licensing arrangements  perpetual or term based and the determination of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for undelivered elements 
many of our licensing arrangements include fixed implementation fees and do not allow us to recognize license revenue until these services have been performed 
certain of the licenses are term or time based licenses 
quadramed recognizes revenue from these contracts ratably over the term of the arrangement 
postcontract customer support pcs for all of the license term is bundled together with the term license and is included in the license revenue in our consolidated financial statements 
contract accounting is applied where services include significant software modification  installation or customization 
in such instances  the services and license fee is accounted for in accordance with sop  whereby the revenue is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input hours 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgment related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting can affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the company classifies revenues from these arrangements as license  installation  hardware  and services revenue based upon the estimated fair value of each element using the residual method  and revenues are reflected in respective revenue categories in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents service revenues from software maintenance and support are recognized ratably over the maintenance term  which in most cases is one year 
service revenues from training  consulting and other service elements are recognized as the services are performed 
hardware revenue is generated primarily from transactions in which customers purchased bundled solutions that included the company s software and third party hardware 
if the bundled solution includes services that provide significant modification  installation or customization  contract accounting is applied in accordance with sop  whereby the revenue is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input hours 
otherwise  hardware revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from deferred maintenance  software installation  consulting and training services not yet rendered  and license revenue deferred until all revenue requirements have been met or as services have been performed 
additionally  there are term based licenses for which revenues are recognized over the term of the contract  which is generally one year 
unbilled receivables are established when revenue is deemed to be recognized based on our revenue recognition policy  however  we do not yet have the right to bill the customer per the contract terms 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due us from our customers for the delivery of products and services 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects our estimate of non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and other specifically identified risks 
intangible assets quadramed s acquisitions of other companies typically result in the acquisition of certain intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are to be separately disclosed on the balance sheet  and are no longer amortized but subject to annual impairment tests or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the company is less than the carrying value 
capitalized software 
software development costs are capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  we establish technological feasibility upon the completion of a working model and beta testing of the software product 
the company amortizes its capitalized software development costs on a straight line basis generally over a period of five years 
other intangible assets 
other intangible assets primarily relate to developed technology  trademarks and customer lists acquired in our business acquisitions 
other intangible assets also include acquired technology whose amortization is included in cost of license 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the provisions of this statement did not have a significant impact on our financial condition or operating results 
developed technology costs are amortized on a straight line basis over a period of three years 
the majority of other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over a period of three to five years 
these assets are reviewed annually for impairment and written down to net realizable value  if necessary  in accordance with sfas no

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for the company s fiscal year ending december  we have adopted sab as of december  and have initially applied its provisions using the cumulative effect transition method in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ended december  accordingly  the company has decreased retained earnings as of january  approximately million with a corresponding offset to other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
