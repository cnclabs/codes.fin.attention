item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the following are some important factors that could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our business if our significant customer changes its purchasing habits  our business could be adversely impacted 
procter gamble is our largest single customer 
we supply procter gamble with fluff pulp and airlaid nonwovens  and sales to procter gamble accounted for approximately of our sales in fiscal year in the event that procter gamble fails to continue to purchase these products from us in substantial volume  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected  particularly if we are unable to attract new customers 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 
as of june   our total debt was approximately million and our total debt  as a percentage of total capitalization  was 
our level of debt could have a significant adverse future effect on our business 
for example we may have limited ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy  research and development costs or other purposes  a substantial portion of our cash flow may be used to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes  our senior secured credit facility covenants require us to meet certain financial objectives and impose other restrictions on business operations 
these covenants and those contained in the indentures governing our senior and senior subordinated notes limit our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business  we may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  our debt level and the various covenants contained in the indentures related to our senior notes  senior subordinated notes and the documents governing our other existing indebtedness may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to certain of our competitors  and our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are at floating rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates 
our ability to pay principal of and interest on our senior notes and senior subordinated notes  to service our other debt and to refinance indebtedness when necessary depends on our financial and operating performance  each of which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations 
if we are unable to pay our debts  we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital 
however  we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible at the time or prove adequate 
also  certain alternative strategies will require the consent of our senior secured lenders before we engage in any such strategy 
our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if our negotiations with the representatives of the unions  to which many of our employees belong  are not successful  our operations could be subject to interruptions at many of our facilities 
as of september   we employed approximately  employees  of whom approximately  are employed at our facilities in the united states 
approximately of the us employees are represented by unions at two plants in perry  florida and memphis  tennessee 
our foley plant s labor agreement expires on march  the agreement for the memphis plant is in effect through march  the union at our canadian facility ratified a new labor agreement effective through june  employee representation is provided by a national union for non management workers at our specialty fibers plant in americana  brazil  and our nonwoven materials plant in steinfurt  germany 
our plants in gaston  lumberton and king  north carolina are not unionized 
none of our facilities has had labor disputes or work stoppages in recent history 
the foley and memphis plants have not experienced any work stoppages due to labor disputes in over years and years  respectively 
we consider our relationships with our employees and their representative organizations to be good 
an extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
problems regarding the negotiation of any labor contracts could also affect our business 
the failure to renegotiate labor agreements in a timely manner could lead to a curtailment or stoppage of work at our factories 
if we negotiated a labor agreement on unfavorable terms  our production costs will increase 
a reduction in production or increasing the costs of production would lower our profits and harm our business 
compliance with extensive general and industry specific environmental laws and regulations requires significant resources  and the significant associated costs may adversely impact our business 
our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with these requirements 
because it is difficult to predict the scope of future requirements  there can be no assurance that we will not incur material environmental compliance costs or liabilities in the future 
the foley plant  located in perry  florida  discharges treated wastewater into the fenholloway river 
under the terms of an agreement with the florida department of environmental protection fdep  approved by the u 
s 
environmental protection agency the epa in  we agreed to a comprehensive plan to attain class iii fishable swimmable status for the fenholloway river under applicable florida law the fenholloway agreement 
the fenholloway agreement requires us  among other things  to i make process changes within the foley plant to reduce the coloration of its wastewater discharge  ii restore certain wetlands areas  iii relocate the wastewater discharge point into the fenholloway river to a point closer to the mouth of the river  and iv provide oxygen enrichment to the treated wastewater prior to discharge at the new location 
we have completed the process changes within the foley plant as required by the fenholloway agreement 
in making these in plant process changes  we incurred significant expenditures  and  we expect to incur significant additional capital expenditures to comply with the remaining obligations under the fenholloway agreement 
based on the requirements of the proposed permit  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million over the next four years beginning fiscal year on in plant process changes  and additional capital expenditures of approximately million over at least five years  possibly beginning as early as fiscal year the amount and timing of these capital expenditures may vary depending on a number of factors 
for additional information on environmental matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these possible expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
because approximately of our sales are to customers outside the united states  we are subject to the economic and political conditions of foreign nations 
we have manufacturing facilities in four countries and sell products in approximately countries 
for the fiscal year ended june   sales of our products outside the united states represented approximately of our sales 
the global economy and relative strength or weakness of the u 
s 
dollar can have a significant impact on our sales 
in addition  although approximately of our sales are denominated in us dollars  it is possible that as we expand globally  we will face increased risks associated with operating in foreign countries  including the risk that foreign currencies will be devalued or that currency exchange rates will fluctuate  the risk that limitations will be imposed on our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or on our foreign subsidiaries ability to remit dividends and other payments to the united states  the risk that our foreign subsidiaries will be required to pay withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to the united states or that the amount of any such taxes will be increased  the risk that certain foreign countries may experience hyperinflation  and the risk that foreign governments may impose or increase investment or other restrictions affecting our business 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
exposure to commodity products creates volatility in pricing and profits 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
risks related to our industry we are subject to the cyclicality of our industry 
the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose and absorbent products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
our financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
furthermore  a general economic downturn in a particular country or on an international scale  could reduce the overall sales within our industry  thereby likely reducing our sales 
we cannot assure you that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition and surplus capacity could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the markets for our products are all competitive 
actions by competitors can affect our ability to sell our products and can affect the volatility of the prices at which our products are sold 
other actions by competitors  such as reducing costs or adding low cost capacity  may adversely affect our competitive position in the products we manufacture and  consequently  our sales  operating income and cash flows 
new competitors and the expansion of existing competitors could create a surplus capacity of the goods that we sell  which might cause us to either lose sales or lower the prices of our goods 
as examples of existing competitors expanding their production  sateri has announced that it will add  tons of specialty pulp capacity in brazil and weyerhauser could reopen a mill with an annual capacity of  metric tons 
actions by our competitors and any surplus capacity could cause our profits to decline  affecting our operating results and financial condition 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of energy and raw materials are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business 
energy  chemicals  and raw material costs  including fuel oil  natural gas  electricity  cotton linters  wood  and caustic and other chemicals are a significant operating expense 
the prices and availability of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial changes due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions  currency fluctuations  weather conditions  political unrest and instability in energy producing nations  and supply and demand considerations 
we have raw material availability issues in our specialty cotton fibers business in both north america and brazil 
we have increased our imported cotton linters purchases for our memphis specialty cotton fiber production in order to minimize the impact of current constraints on north american cotton fiber availability 
we have limited production at our americana  brazil specialty fibers facility because of raw material constraints in brazil 
for the near term  this raw material availability will limit growth and increase our production costs 
additionally  energy and chemical costs have increased substantially in recent years  which has resulted in increased production costs for our products 
increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to increased costs  it is possible that a disruption in supply of natural gas or other fossil fuels could limit our ability to operate our facilities 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of transportation are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business 
our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products  both domestically and internationally 
an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges and or a reduction in transport availability in truck  rail and international shipping could negatively impact our ability to provide products to our customers in a timely manner 
an increase in international shipping rates or fuel surcharges or a reduction in the availability of vessels could negatively impact our costs and our ability to provide products to our international customers in a timely manner 
while we have had adequate transportation availability  there is no assurance that such availability can continue to be effectively managed in the future

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and contractual obligations  as well as discussing our critical accounting policies 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other sections of this annual report on form k 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  financial condition and critical accounting policies 
executive summary buckeye manufactures and distributes value added cellulose based specialty products used in numerous applications  including disposable diapers  personal hygiene products  engine  air and oil filters  concrete reinforcing fibers  food casings  cigarette filters  rayon filaments  acetate plastics  thickeners and papers 
our products are produced in the united states  canada  germany and brazil  and we sell these products in approximately countries worldwide 
we generate revenues  operating income and cash flows from two reporting segments specialty fibers and nonwoven materials 
specialty fibers are derived from wood and cotton cellulose materials using wetlaid technologies 
our nonwoven materials are derived from wood pulps  synthetic fibers and other materials using an airlaid process 
our strategy is to continue to strengthen our position as a leading supplier of cellulose based specialty products 
we believe that we can continue to expand market share  improve profitability and decrease our exposure to cyclical downturns by pursuing the following strategic objectives focus on technically demanding niche markets  develop and commercialize innovative proprietary products  strengthen long term alliances with customers  provide our products at an attractive value  evaluate external growth opportunities that match our specialty market focus  and continue to improve our balance sheet 
buckeye had an excellent year  with record revenue and the highest earnings in six years 
net sales for fiscal year were million  a increase over the million achieved in fiscal year we earned net income of million for fiscal year these results included the following after tax items a million benefit from a water conservation partnership payment  a million benefit from reversal of accrued interest related to cancellation of a contingent note owed to stac pac technologies inc  a million tax benefit from adjustments related to state valuation allowances and credits  a million restructuring charge and a million charge related to early debt retirement 
our markets continue to be robust 
reliability of our operations is generally good  and we will continue to focus on operations stability and high up time 
earnings benefited from higher selling prices across all of our businesses 
the fluff pulp market remains strong and prices for fluff pulp continued to increase throughout the year 
price increases in high end specialty fibers and nonwoven materials accounted for two thirds of the overall selling price increase 
we were able to make up for some of the margin erosion experienced over the past several years due to higher energy  chemicals and transportation costs through annual increases in the mid single digit range for high end specialty fibers and in the low single digit range for nonwoven materials 
our costs were lower in fiscal than in the prior year due to lower energy costs  improved capacity utilization at our north american airlaid plants and improvements in our americana operation  which were partially offset by higher raw material costs in our cotton cellulose and nonwovens materials businesses  increased transportation costs and higher direct costs 
as a result of higher selling prices  improved mix and lower costs  our gross margin for the year improved to compared to for the prior year 
our margins in the just completed quarter were above 
we continue to make progress at our americana cotton fiber facility in brazil 
our focus on reliability and efficiency is starting to pay off as our americana team gains experience operating the new process 
we have and expect to continue to reduce costs and increase prices to offset the rising strength of the brazilian real against the us dollar  and we are making good progress toward being cash neutral 
we expect our performance to continue to improve but we cannot predict when the site will be profitable due to constraints on raw material availability and price 
we continue to establish our global sales and distribution network for ultrafiber  our concrete reinforcing fiber 
ultrafiber is a niche product for the building industry and is an example of the new product initiatives we are undertaking to reduce our dependency on fluff pulp 
for the year ended june   our sales increased by to million from million for the same period in our customer base has almost doubled and installations of our dispensers  that provide ready mix operators with significant savings through automation  increased from to units  positioning us for a year of strong sales growth in fiscal our goal is to double ultrafiber fiscal year sales in strong cash flow generation enabled us to reduce debt by million  including the cancellation of the million stac pac note  during the year ended june  as a result  our net interest expense for the year was down million including million reversal of accrued interest related to a contingent note compared to the previous year 
cash generated from operations in the year just completed was million compared to million in fiscal we have reduced our long term debt by approximately million over the past five years 
the entire organization is involved in lean enterprise learning and implementation 
we are pleased with the progress we made this year with a significant reduction in working capital and progress in eliminating non value added activities 
we know this is a journey and we have just begun to create a culture that will improve the speed of our business processes  improve product and service quality and reduce cost 
our lean enterprise initiative is important and we must improve to stay competitive and avoid complacency 
we trained over of our organization  including all officers and site managers  in the basic elements of lean thinking during fiscal results of operations consolidated results the following table compares the components of consolidated operating income for the three fiscal years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  research and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles and other impairment and restructuring costs operating income net sales were higher during the year ended june   primarily driven by higher selling prices across all segments of our business 
the shift from tolling operations to market sales at our americana specialty fibers facility contributed a positive mix impact 
a positive currency impact  due to the strong euro  added to the improvement 
shipment volume was down for the year ended june   mainly due to the closure of our specialty fibers facility in glueckstadt  germany 
net sales increased during fiscal year primarily due to improved pricing and mix on our products 
demand for high end specialty fibers helped drive prices higher throughout the year 
higher shipment volumes and increased pricing drove sales of nonwoven materials higher during fiscal year additionally  the implementation of the product price surcharge effective october  through march  had a positive impact on revenues 
the product price surcharge improved revenues by million for fiscal year the gross margin improvement from fiscal year to fiscal year was mainly a result of the higher selling prices discussed previously 
we also had improved operational results at our americana plant  lower energy costs  and improved capacity utilization at our north american nonwovens sites 
these improvements more than offset increased raw material costs in our cotton fibers and nonwovens business  increased transportation cost and higher plant direct cost 
in fiscal year versus fiscal year cost of goods sold and gross margins were negatively impacted by high costs related to increases in the pricing of energy  chemicals and transportation 
during fiscal year  these costs were higher by approximately versus fiscal selling  research and administrative expenses decreased slightly in the year ended june  as a percentage of net sales these costs were down from in fiscal to in fiscal the expense reduction was mainly a result of reduced headcount and lower spending on sales commissions 
increases in selling  research and administrative expenses during fiscal had a negative impact on our operating margins 
expenses related to the establishment of an ultrafiber sales force and distribution network  the expensing of share based payments and the expensing of previously capitalized patent costs contributed to increased costs 
during the second half of the year ended june   we entered into a restructuring program that complements our operations consolidations and involves consolidation in our european sales offices  product and market development and corporate overhead 
we expect the total cost of this program will be approximately million and that it will be completed during the first quarter of the fiscal year 
as a result of this restructuring  positions will be eliminated which we expect to provide annual savings of over million 
further discussion of revenue  operating trends  impairment and restructuring costs can be found later in this md a 
additional information on the impairment and restructuring programs and charges may also be found in note  impairment of long lived assets and assets held for sale  and note  restructuring costs  to the consolidated financial statements of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
segment results although nonwoven materials  processes  customers  distribution methods and regulatory environment are very similar to specialty fibers  we believe it is appropriate for nonwoven materials to be disclosed as a separate reporting segment from specialty fibers 
the specialty fibers segment is an aggregation of cellulosic fibers based on both wood and cotton 
we make separate financial decisions and allocate resources based on the sales and operating income of each segment 
we allocate selling  research  and administration expense to each segment  and we use the resulting operating income to measure the performance of the two segments 
we exclude items that are not included in measuring business performance  such as restructuring costs  asset impairment  amortization of intangibles and certain financing and investing costs 
specialty fibers the following table compares specialty fibers net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income specialty fibers net sales improved during the year ended june  versus the prior year  primarily driven by higher selling prices and improved product mix  offset partially by the closure of the glueckstadt plant  which had a negative impact on sales volume 
strong demand in our high end specialty and fluff markets allowed us to raise prices during the year 
fluff pulp pricing increased by approximately per ton on the average during the year ended june  versus the previous year 
average selling prices on our high end specialty products increased in the mid single digit range for the year 
sales pricing and improved product mix were the primary drivers of our operating income improvement 
costs were up compared to the prior year as the impact of lower energy costs was not enough to offset increases in transportation costs  raw material costs and factory direct costs 
we have made good progress at our americana cotton fiber facility in brazil 
reduced costs and higher volumes contributed to improved earnings 
the focus on reliability and efficiency has been successful and the facility has demonstrated the ability to run at design rate and high reliability 
the operation averaged tons per day during the just completed quarter with many days at or above the design rate of tons per day 
we are confident that the facility has the capability of  tons annually 
the process is delivering quality products with little offgrade 
the cotton crop in brazil this year is up from the prior year  but the amount of seed delinted and crushed for oil will not increase as much as we had hoped 
we are strengthening relationships with existing raw material suppliers to increase delinting capacity and assisting with their expansion plans 
this looks positive  but will take time to implement 
in the near term  we will continue to operate the facility at its current rate of approximately  tons per month 
although demand for our high end specialty fibers products and the implementation of a product price surcharge pushed pricing higher during fiscal year  the favorable earnings impact of higher prices was offset by lower volumes due to the closure of our glueckstadt  germany cotton specialty fibers facility  the start up of market operations of our americana  brazil facility and production and transportation issues at our perry  florida facility 
average fluff pulp pricing declined by less that during fiscal year versus fiscal year for fiscal year  fluff pulp sales accounted for of our consolidated sales 
strong demand in our high end markets allowed us to raise prices during fiscal year to partially offset higher costs for energy  chemicals and transportation 
however  due to the rapid and continued increase in costs along with the slightly lower prices for fluff pulp  we were unable to maintain our margins at the same level as those realized during fiscal year nonwoven materials the following table compares nonwoven materials net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income a strong market for nonwoven materials in north america contributed to the increase in net sales during fiscal year versus fiscal year increased demand resulted in higher sales volumes at increased selling prices 
we implemented similar sales price increases in europe during the year  and our sales volume remained stable 
additionally  net sales in europe saw improvement due to the strengthening of the euro during this time period 
most products sold at our steinfurt  germany facility are denominated in euros and translated to us dollars for consolidation purposes 
operating income improvement during fiscal year versus fiscal year was driven by the increased volumes and selling prices 
increased volumes in north america and the associated improvements in capacity utilization helped to improve operating margins during the year 
higher revenues from increased selling prices largely offset increased raw material costs in north america and europe 
operating income improved during the twelve months ended june  versus the same period in higher revenue from volume and increased pricing overcame higher raw materials  energy  transportation  and other manufacturing costs to improve operating margins during the period 
restructuring and impairment activities during the three years ended june   we entered into various restructuring programs  which resulted in restructuring and impairment charges 
in order to continue to provide both specialty fibers and nonwoven materials at attractive values  we will continue to look for ways to reduce costs and optimize our operating structure 
the following table summarizes restructuring expense by program and impairment charges for the three years ended june  following the table is an explanation of the programs and the resulting impairment charges 
for further explanation of these charges  see note  impairment of long lived assets and assets held for sale  and note  restructuring costs  to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended june total millions charges impairment charges restructuring costs restructuring program restructuring program restructuring program restructuring programs total restructuring costs restructuring program in january  we entered into a restructuring program that complements our operations consolidations and involves consolidation in our european sales offices  product and market development and corporate overhead operations 
we anticipate the total cost of this program will be approximately million and will be completed during the first quarter of the fiscal year 
as a result of this restructuring  positions will be eliminated which will provide annual savings of over million 
restructuring program and impairments in january  we announced our decision to discontinue producing cotton linter pulp at our glueckstadt facility 
our decision was due to a combination of factors that had increased the plant s costs to a level at which it was uneconomical to continue operations 
the most significant factor impacting cost at the site was the substantial strengthening of the euro over calendar and specialty fibers are normally priced and sold in us dollars around the world 
as a majority of glueckstadt s costs were denominated in euros  this substantial strengthening had a negative impact on glueckstadt s cost position 
additionally  glueckstadt s process water  waste treatment and energy costs were more than twice the cost of these utilities at our memphis  tennessee cotton based specialty fibers facility 
faced with these difficulties  we reduced the number of employees at the facility from approximately to approximately and operated at of capacity during calendar year after careful consideration  we decided to close and cease production at glueckstadt in december we believe that the closure of our glueckstadt facility and transfer of the majority of its cotton based specialty fiber production to our memphis  tennessee and americana  brazil facilities will yield a more competitive cost structure 
based on our inability to recover the remaining value of the long lived assets at the glueckstadt facility  we determined that these long lived assets  with a carrying amount of million  were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million 
this resulted in an impairment charge of million million after tax  during fiscal year during fiscal year  we began to actively market the land and buildings  and the equipment which had carrying values of million and million  respectively 
current markets and third party interest for the land and buildings indicated we would not be able to recover the carrying value through the sales process 
therefore  we wrote down the carrying value of the land and buildings to their fair value less costs to sell of million and recorded an additional impairment charge of million during fiscal year subsequent to this impairment  we sold the land and building for million 
as of june   management reevaluated its estimate of fair value less the cost to sell the remaining equipment and determined an additional impairment should be recognized for equipment with a carrying value of million 
therefore  we wrote down the carrying value of the remaining equipment to its fair value less costs to sell of million and recorded an impairment charge of million 
in september  the remaining assets were sold for million 
since we previously had written the value of these assets down to million  we recorded a gain on sales of assets held for sale of million 
the closure of the glueckstadt facility resulted in the termination of employees  and restructuring expenses related to the closure of million over fiscal year and restructuring program and impairments during fiscal  we initiated the discontinuation of production of nonwoven materials at our cork  ireland facility 
subsequent to the closure of this facility  we completed the sale of our related building and equipment 
as a result of the sale and disposition of the building and equipment for net proceeds of million net of million of decommissioning and selling costs  we recognized a net gain of million million net of tax and per share net of tax during fiscal the gain is presented under the gain on sale of assets held for sale caption in the statement of operations 
we continued to meet customer needs for nonwoven materials by producing these products at our facilities in delta  british columbia  canada  steinfurt  germany  and gaston county  north carolina 
this consolidation reduced working capital needs  and we began to realize fully the on going cost benefit from operating one less facility during the third quarter of fiscal the closure of the cork facility and related reorganization of the nonwoven materials segment resulted in the termination of employees and resulted in restructuring expenses totaling million 
restructuring programs and impairments in april  we announced the discontinuation of production of cotton linter pulp at our specialty fibers lumberton  north carolina facility due to the decline in demand for cotton content paper  eliminating approximately positions 
we completed this partial closure in august but continue to produce cosmetic cotton products at the lumberton site 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a second phase of this restructuring program 
as a result of this restructuring  positions were eliminated 
these positions include manufacturing  sales  product development and administrative functions throughout the organization 
the total cost of the programs was million  of which was expensed in fiscal during fiscal year  we began to actively market idled cotton linter pulping equipment which had a carrying value of million 
management evaluated its estimate of fair value less the cost to sell the assets and determined an impairment should be recognized for the equipment 
we wrote down the carrying value of the equipment to its fair value less costs to sell of million and recorded an impairment charge of million during fiscal year subsequent to this impairment  we sold the equipment for net proceeds of million 
interest expense and amortization of debt costs interest expense and amortization of debt costs decreased million for fiscal year versus fiscal year this decrease includes the reversal of million of accrued interest related to the cancellation of a contingent note owed to stac pac technologies inc the remaining decrease was primarily due to lower debt levels 
the decrease would have been larger  but capitalized interest related to the americana project reduced last year s interest expense by million that was not replicated in fiscal the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt increased from at june  to at june  see note  debt  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of variable interest rates 
we incurred interest expense and amortization of debt costs of million in fiscal  down million from fiscal this improvement was primarily the result of lower average debt levels during fiscal and the impact of the capitalized interest discussed previously 
these improvements were partially offset by higher average variable interest rates during fiscal loss on early extinguishment of debt costs fiscal year during fiscal year we used cash from operations to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due in and to make voluntary prepayments on our term loan of million 
as a result of these partial extinguishments  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs  resulting in non cash expense of million during fiscal year fiscal year on september  we used borrowings on our revolving credit facility to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due in as a result of this partial extinguishment  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs  resulting in non cash expense of million during fiscal year fiscal year on march  we used cash on hand to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due in as a result of this partial extinguishment  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs  resulting in non cash expense of million during fiscal year see note  debt  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the debt issuance and related extinguishment 
gain on sale of assets held for sale in september  the remaining assets located at our glueckstadt facility were sold for million 
since we had previously written the value of these assets down to million  we recorded a gain on sale of assets held for sale of million during fiscal in july  we ceased production of nonwoven materials at our cork  ireland facility 
subsequent to the july closure of the facility  we began to actively market the building and equipment with carrying values of million and million  respectively 
in late december of  we completed the sale of the cork facility building to the port of cork company for million 
although the carrying values of these assets were based on appraisals and available market information at the time of the impairment in march of  the purchase of this building for strategic purposes by the port of cork company was not contemplated in those appraisals 
as a result of the sale and disposition of the building and equipment for net proceeds after decommissioning and other expenses of million  we recognized a net gain of million million net of tax during fiscal year foreign exchange and other foreign exchange and other in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the income in fiscal was primarily due to million from a water conversation partnership payment received pursuant to our reduction in the daily water permit limit at the foley plant 
the expense in fiscal was primarily due to foreign currency losses as a result of the strengthening of the canadian dollar during the fiscal year 
the expense in fiscal was primarily due to million of expenses related to amending our senior secured credit facility and other financing related costs 
income tax expense our effective tax rate for was approximately versus in fiscal and in fiscal this tax rate includes a tax benefit from reduction in the tennessee state net operating loss valuation allowance and recognition of tennessee industrial machinery credits totaling million during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of tax planning 
our brazilian valuation allowance increased million in due to losses associated with the slower than expected start up of the americana  brazil operations 
effective for transactions occurring after september  the internal revenue service enacted the extraterritorial income exclusion 
the income exclusion provides for a reduction of gross income by a percentage of qualifying foreign trade income 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
in order to comply with international trade rules  the act repealed the current tax treatment for extraterritorial income 
effective for transactions entered into after december   the extraterritorial income exclusion is subject to a phase out which was completed on december  for transactions during calendar years and  the income exclusion was and of the exclusion otherwise allowed  respectively 
our extraterritorial income exclusion benefit was reduced in fiscal due to this phase out and was phased out completely during the second half of fiscal the act provides a tax deduction for domestic manufacturers 
the deduction will be phased in during fiscal years through due to our us net operating loss position  this deduction had no impact to fiscal year other than a slight reduction to alternative minimum taxes 
see note  income taxes  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
effective june   many of the tax measures introduced in the canadian federal budget were passed into law 
included in the budget was a reduction in the general corporate tax rate to for  for  and for and later years 
as a result  the company remeasured its canadian deferred tax balances based on the reversal pattern of the company s temporary differences  resulting in a million net tax benefit 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the irs completed an audit of our tax return for fiscal year with the conclusion of this audit  we released the reserve on a tax deduction we claimed relating to our investment in our former facility in cork  ireland and recorded a non cash tax benefit of million to our provision for income taxes 
financial condition our financial condition continued to improve during fiscal year we are committed to reducing our debt  strengthening our operations and continuing to improve our profitability and cash flow 
liquidity and capitalization we have the following major sources of financing a senior secured credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
our senior secured credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain various covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of june   and believe we will continue to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
these sources of financing are described in detail in note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements 
our total debt and capital leases decreased million including the cancellation of the million note owed to stac pac technologies inc to million at june  from million at june  from june  to june   total debt decreased by million 
our total debt as a percentage of our total capitalization was at june  as compared to at june  and at june  on june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million borrowing capacity on our old credit facility 
on july   we established a new million senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of july  this facility amends and restates our existing credit facility 
initially  we used the proceeds from this new credit facility to pay the outstanding balance on the former credit facility plus fees and expenses 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolver is grid based pricing  related to our total leverage ratio  of the agent s prime rate plus to or a libor based rate ranging from libor plus to libor plus 
we plan to use the proceeds from this facility to redeem the remaining million of our notes  to redeem million of the notes in mid september  and for general corporate purposes 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets located in the united states 
the new credit facility contains covenants customary for financing of this type 
the financial covenants include maximum total leverage ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense 
during fiscal year  we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our old credit facility 
the new credit facility taking into account the million outstanding on the old term loan increased borrowing capacity to million 
the new credit facility also contains a million increase option 
the portion of this capacity that we could borrow on a particular date will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the new revolving credit facility 
the commitment fee  on the unused portion of the new revolving credit facility  ranges from to per annum based on a grid related to our leverage ratio 
total costs for the issuance of the new facility were approximately million and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the facility 
management believes this is sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the business 
we believe we will continue to have positive cash flow and these borrowing conditions are not expected to impact our operating or investing activities  or our ability to service our debt obligations 
treasury stock our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
under this authorization  we will hold the repurchased shares as treasury stock and such shares will be available for general corporate purposes  including the funding of employee benefit and stock related plans 
we have not repurchased any shares of our common stock since fiscal year through june   we had repurchased a total of  shares under the current board authority 
cash flow while we can offer no assurances  we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with current cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures  meet operating expenses and service our debt obligations for the foreseeable future 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at june   compared to million at june  and million at june  the following table provides a summary of cash flows for the three years ended june  millions operating activities net income noncash charges and credits  net changes in operating assets and liabilities  net net cash provided by operating activities investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment proceeds from sales of assets other investing activities net cash used in investing activities financing activities net borrowings payments under lines of credit payments on long term debt and other other financing activities  net net cash used in financing activities effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities the million increase in cash flows from operating activities in was primarily due to improved profits of million  higher accounts payable and current liabilities and deferred taxes 
the higher current liabilities were the result of increases in taxes payable  incentive plans and general payables 
the change in deferred taxes was a result of our higher profits and the reversal of some federal and state valuation allowances being an offset to our net operating loss 
the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities in was primarily the result of the decrease in net income in fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by general improvements in working capital during fiscal although the closure of our glueckstadt plant improved working capital in fiscal  this improvement was partially offset by increased working capital requirements at our americana  brazil specialty fibers facility as we moved away from the previous tolling arrangement toward market production 
net cash used in investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment were consistent during the last three fiscal years 
we expect efficiency improvement and energy savings projects  maintenance capital  and environmental spending will result in total capital expenditures of approximately million for fiscal we expect to incur significant capital expenditures in the future to comply with environmental obligations at our perry  florida specialty fibers facility 
based on the requirements of the proposed permit  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million over the next four years beginning fiscal year on in plant process changes  and additional capital expenditures of approximately million over at least five years  possibly beginning as early as fiscal year the amount and timing of these capital expenditures may vary depending on a number of factors 
for additional information on environmental matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year  we used cash from operations and million received from option exercises to reduce our debt and capital leases by million 
we are focused on debt reduction with an intermediate term objective of a debt to equity balance in our capital structure 
see note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
during fiscal year we used cash from operations to finance the capital investments we made at our americana  brazil facility  and to redeem  at par  million principal amount of our high interest rate   senior subordinated notes due in contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations as of june  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years greater than years long term obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations timber commitments linter commitments other purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations amounts include related interest payments 
interest payments for variable debt of million are based on the effective rate as of june  of 
see note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on interest rates 
capital lease obligations represent principal and interest payments 
see note  leases  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
see note  commitments  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
linter commitments are take or pay contracts made in the ordinary course of business that usually are less than one year in length 
the majority of other purchase commitments are take or pay contracts made in the ordinary course of business related to utilities and raw material purchases 
less than one year references fiscal  years references fiscal and  years references fiscal and note additionally  the cash flow to fund postretirement benefit obligations has an expected net present value of million 
the actuarially estimated annual benefit payments net of retiree contributions are as follows million  million  million  and through million 
these obligations are not included in the table above as the total obligation is based on the present value of the payments and would not be consistent with the contractual cash obligations disclosures included in the table above 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our critical and significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates underlying our financial statements requires the exercise of management s judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
our management exercises critical judgment in the application of our accounting policies in the following areas  which significantly affect our financial condition and results of operation 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for receivables we believe we may not collect in full 
management evaluates the collectibility of accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations ie  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
bad debt expense for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
deferred income taxes and other liabilities deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax law treatment of certain items 
realization of certain components of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
these valuation allowances can be impacted by changes in tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels and are based on our judgment  estimates and assumptions regarding those future events 
in fiscal  we increased the valuation allowance recorded against certain foreign net operating losses by approximately million and decreased the valuation allowances recorded against certain state net operating losses and tax credits by approximately million 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance through a charge to income in the period that such determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period that such determination is made 
we record our world wide tax provision based on the tax rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant managerial judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
where we believe that the deduction of an item is supportable for income tax purposes  the item is deducted in our income tax returns 
however  where treatment of an item is uncertain  tax contingency reserves are recorded based upon the expected most probable outcome taking into consideration the specific tax regulations and facts of each matter 
these reserves are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities 
we adjust these reserves when an identifiable event occurs that changes the most probable outcome 
depreciation we provide for depreciation on our production machinery and equipment at our cotton cellulose and airlaid nonwovens plants using the units of production depreciation method 
under this method  we calculate depreciation based on the expected total productive hours of the assets subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
we review our estimate of total productive hours at least annually 
if the estimated productive hours of these assets change based on changes in utilization and useful life assumptions  we adjust depreciation expense per unit of production accordingly 
we use the straight line method for determining depreciation on our other capital assets 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
for assets that are held and used  recoverability is evaluated based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of the assets is determined to not be recoverable  we measure the potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their fair value 
if impairment exists  an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value 
estimated fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals  as applicable 
assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value 
based on the estimated fair values of long lived assets  we recorded no impairment charges in fiscal year we recorded million  and million for years ended june   and  respectively 
if circumstances change  our estimated fair values may be impacted and have a material effect on our reported financial position and results of operations 
see note  impairment of long lived assets and assets held for sale  of our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning impairment charges 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and  as a consequence  discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
under the guidelines of sfas  goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
unless circumstances otherwise dictate  we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets that meet certain criteria over their useful lives 
we utilize the present value of expected net cash flows to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
this present value model requires management to estimate future net cash flows  the timing of these cash flows and an appropriate discount rate or weighted average cost of capital representing the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of future cash flows 
the discount rate is based on independently calculated beta risks for a composite group of companies  our target capital mix and an estimated market risk premium 
the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows were consistent with the reporting unit s internal planning 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired 
the determination of an impairment loss is complex and requires that we make many assumptions and estimates 
if our estimates of future cash flows or the underlying assumptions and estimates change  we may need to record impairment losses in the future 
see note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on long lived assets 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  raw material costs and the price of certain commodities used in our production processes 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures 
further  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming that certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risks discussed below should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
a discussion of our accounting policies for risk management is included in note  accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the fair value of our long term public debt is based on an average of the bid and offer prices at year end 
the fair value of the credit facility approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate 
the carrying value and fair value of long term debt at june  were million and million and at june  were million and million  respectively 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates and would amount to a million increase in the fair value of long term debt as of june  we had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding at june  at this borrowing level  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have a million unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows 
the primary interest rate exposures on floating rate debt are with respect to european inter bank rates and us prime rates 
foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
buckeye and our subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and costs and their translation into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed include the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
our euro exposure is internally hedged for the most part because a high percentage of both the sales and costs at our steinfurt  germany plant are denominated in euros 
we currently hedge about of our balance sheet exposure to the canadian dollar and we do not have any hedges in place to protect aganst fluctuations in the brazilian real 
however  we are continuously evaluating our foreign currency exposure and our hedging policy is subject to change 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not generally hedge these net investments 
however  we use capital structuring techniques to manage our net investment in foreign currencies as considered necessary 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is million and million at june  and  respectively 
the potential foreign currency translation loss from investment in foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to approximately million at june  this change would be reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the primary foreign currency exposures on our long term investments are with the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
availability and cost of raw materials amounts paid by us for wood  cotton fiber and fluff pulp represent the largest component of our variable costs of production 
the availability and cost of these materials are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors beyond our control  including weather conditions 
significant decreases in availability or increases in the cost of wood or cotton fiber to the extent not reflected in prices for our products  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have potential raw material availability issues in our specialty cotton fibers business in both north america and brazil 
we have increased our imported cotton linters purchases for our memphis specialty cotton fiber production facility in order to minimize the impact of the current constraints on north american cotton fiber availability 
currently our production is constrained by lint availability 
commodities we are dependent on commodities in our production process 
natural gas  electricity  fuel oil  caustic and other chemicals are just some of the commodities that our processes rely upon 
exposure to these commodities can have a significant impact on our operating performance 
in may  we entered into a seven year electrical power contract for power usage in brazil 
this contract bypasses the local utility company thereby reducing our energy costs by approximately million each year 
in order to minimize market exposure  we may use forward contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases of fossil fuels over a period of generally less than one year 
there were no fossil fuel contracts outstanding at june  or requiring fair value treatment 
exposure to commodity products also creates volatility in pricing 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp and other commodity products  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
industry cyclicality the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose based products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
it is not certain that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may thus fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingencies our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with such requirements 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements 
given the uncertainties associated with predicting the scope of future requirements  there can be no assurance that we will not in the future incur material environmental compliance costs or liabilities 
for additional information on environmental matters  see note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements
