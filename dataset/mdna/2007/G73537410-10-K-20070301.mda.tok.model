item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights significant factors influencing our consolidated financial position and our results of operations 
it should be read in conjunction with the summary of selected financial data  consolidated financial statements and related notes found under part ii  item and item contained herein 
in addition  you should read our discussion of critical accounting policies beginning on page for an explanation of those accounting estimates that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the most important factors we monitor to evaluate our financial condition and performance includes o operations premiums  changes in the number of treaties and life insurance in force  investment results  claim frequency and severity trends  claims and benefit ratio and acquisition and expense ratios and operating earnings per share  o investments credit quality experience  stability of long term returns  cash flows and asset and liability duration  and o financial condition our financial strength ratings  financial leverage  liquidity and growth in return on equity and book value per share 
revenues  expenses and other factors affecting profitability revenues we derive revenue primarily from premiums from reinsurance assumed on life business from existing treaties and from premiums on new treaties  investment income  realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio and fees from our financial solutions and wealth management businesses 
our primary business is life reinsurance  which involves reinsuring life insurance policies  with premiums earned typically over a period of to years 
each year  however  a portion of the business under existing treaties terminates due to  among other things  lapses or surrenders of underlying policies  deaths of policyholders occasionally and the exercise of recapture options by ceding companies 
premiums from reinsurance assumed on life business are included in revenues over the premium paying period of the underlying policies 
when we acquire blocks of in force business  we account for these transactions as purchases  and our results of operations include the net income from these blocks as of their respective dates of acquisition 
reinsurance assumed on annuity business does not generate premium income but generates investment income over time on the assets we receive from the ceding company 
we also earn revenues on funding agreements 
a deposit received on a funding agreement also does not generate premium income but does create income to the extent we earn an investment return in excess of our interest payment obligations thereon 
our investment income includes interest earned on our fixed income investments and income from funds withheld at interest under modified coinsurance agreements or coinsurance funds withheld agreements 
under gaap  because our fixed income investments are held as available for sale  these securities are carried at fair value  and unrealized appreciation depreciation on these securities is not included in investment income on our statements of income loss  but is included in comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses include gains and losses on investment securities that we sell during a period  write downs of securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
expenses we have six principal types of expenses claims and policy benefits under our reinsurance contracts  interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities  acquisition costs and other insurance expenses  operating expenses  collateral finance facilities expense and interest expense 
when we issue a life reinsurance contract  we establish reserves for claims and future policy benefits 
these reserves are our estimates of what we expect to pay in claims and policy benefits and related expenses under the contract or policy 
from time to time  we may change the reserves if our experience leads us to believe that benefit claims and expenses will ultimately be greater than the existing reserve 
we report the change in these reserves as an expense during the period when the reserve or additional reserve is established 
in connection with reinsurance of annuity and annuity type products  we record a liability for interest sensitive contract liabilities  which represents the amount ultimately due to the policyholder 
we credit interest to these contracts each period at the rates determined in the underlying contract  and the amount is reported as interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities on our consolidated statements of income loss 
a portion of the costs of acquiring new business  such as commissions  certain internal expenses related to our policy issuance and underwriting departments and other variable selling expenses are capitalized 
the resulting deferred acquisition costs asset is amortized over future periods based on our expectations as to the emergence of future gross profits from the underlying contracts 
these costs are dependent on the structure  size and type of business written 
for certain products  we may retrospectively adjust our amortization when we revise our estimate of current or future gross profits to be realized 
the effects of this adjustment are reflected in earnings in the period in which we revise our estimate 
acquisition costs also include letter of credit costs although this amount has decreased significantly in the past two years due to the collateral finance transactions we have completed for which the cost is included in collateral finance facility expense 
operating expenses consist of salary and salary related expenses  legal and professional fees  rent and office expenses  travel and entertainment expenses  directors expenses  insurance and other similar expenses  except to the extent capitalized in deferred acquisition costs 
collateral finance facilities expense includes costs incurred on our regulation xxx funding arrangements and other collateral finance facilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest expense consists of interest charges on our long term debt and hycu instruments 
other factors affecting profitability we seek to generate profits from two principal sources 
first  in our life reinsurance business  we seek to receive reinsurance premiums and financial reinsurance fees that  together with income from the assets in which those premiums are invested  exceed the amounts we ultimately pay as claims and policy benefits  acquisition costs and ceding commissions 
second  within our investment guidelines  we seek to maximize the return on our unallocated capital 
the following factors affect our profitability o the volume of business we write  o volume and amount of death claims incurred and lapse experience  o our ability to assess and price adequately for the risks we assume  o changes in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets  o the mix of different types of business that we reinsure  because profits on some lines of business emerge later than on other lines  o our ability to manage our assets and liabilities to manage investment and liquidity risk  and o our ability to control expenses 
in addition  our profits can be affected by a number of factors that are not within our control 
for example  movements in interest rates can affect the volume of business that we write  the income earned from our investments  the interest we credit on interest sensitive contracts  the level of surrender activity on contracts that we reinsure and the rate at which we amortize deferred acquisition costs 
other external factors that can affect profitability include mortality experience that varies from our assumed mortality 
in addition  while death claims are reasonably predictable over a period of many years  claims become less predictable over shorter periods and are subject to significant fluctuation from quarter to quarter and year to year 
other factors include changes in regulation or tax laws which may affect the attractiveness of our products or the costs of doing business and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies given the nature of our business  our accounting policies require the use of judgments relating to a variety of assumptions and estimates 
because of the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions and estimates underlying these accounting policies under different conditions or assumptions  the amounts reported in our financial statements could be materially different 
our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the establishment of reserves for future policy benefits  the capitalization and amortization of deferred acquisition costs  the valuation of present value of in force business  the valuation of investment impairments  estimates of premiums  the valuation of tax balances and the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises applies to our traditional life policies with continuing premiums 
for these policies  reserves for future policy benefits are computed based upon expected mortality rates  lapse rates  investment yields  expenses and other assumptions established at policy issue  including a margin for adverse deviation 
once these assumptions are made for a given treaty or group of treaties  they will not be changed over the life of the treaty 
we periodically review actual historical experience and relative anticipated experience compared to the assumptions used to establish reserves for future policy benefits 
further  we determine whether actual and anticipated experience indicates that existing policy reserves together with the present value of future gross premiums are sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits  settlement and maintenance costs and to recover unamortized acquisition costs 
significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected losses on a group of treaties by establishing additional net reserves 
because of the many assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves and the long term nature of the reinsurance contracts  the reserving process  while based on actuarial science  is inherently uncertain 
we primarily rely on our own valuation and administration systems to establish reserves for future policy benefits 
the reserves for future policy benefits may differ from those established by ceding companies due to the use of different assumptions  based principally on actual and anticipated experience  including industry experience and standards 
we rely on our ceding companies  however  to provide accurate policy level data  including face amount  age  duration and other characteristics as well as underlying premiums and claims 
this data constitutes the primary information used to establish reserves for essentially all of our future policy benefits 
the use of reinsurance intermediaries in our transactions with ceding companies has been infrequent 
in the few instances in which intermediaries are involved  we receive data from the intermediary in a similar timeframe and fashion as if received directly from the ceding company 
claims payable for incurred but not reported losses are determined using case basis estimates and lag studies of past experience 
the time lag from the date of the claim or death to when the ceding company reports the claim to us can vary significantly by ceding company  but generally averages around months 
we update our analysis of incurred but not reported losses  including lag studies  on a quarterly basis and adjust our claim liabilities accordingly 
the adjustments in a given period have generally not been significant relative to the overall reserves for future policy benefits or our results of operations 
in the underwriting process  we perform procedures to evaluate the ceding company s process for compiling and reporting data 
after entering into a reinsurance contract  we work closely with our ceding companies to help ensure information submitted by them is in accordance with the underlying reinsurance contracts 
additionally  we have a dedicated compliance team that performs extensive audits  including on site audits and desk reviews  of the information provided by ceding companies 
in addition to ceding company audits  we routinely perform analysis  at a treaty level  to compare the actual results of ceding companies against initial pricing and expected results 
generally  there have been few disputes or disagreements with ceding companies and most are resolved through normal administration procedures 
occasionally  we experience processing backlogs and establish reserves for processing backlogs with a goal of clearing all backlogs as quickly as possible 
there were no significant processing backlogs at december  sfas no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments applies to investment contracts  limited premium contracts  and universal life type contracts 
for investment and universal life type contracts  future benefit liabilities are held using the retrospective deposit method  increased for amounts representing unearned revenue or refundable policy charges 
acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as a constant percentage of gross margins using assumptions as to mortality  persistency  and expense established at policy issue without provision for adverse deviation and are revised periodically to reflect emerging actual experience and any material changes in expected future experience 
liabilities and the deferral of acquisition costs are established for limited premium policies under the same practices as used for traditional life policies with the exception that any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recognized into income as a constant percentage of insurance in force 
should the liabilities for future policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums for a product be insufficient to provide for expected future benefits and expenses for that product  deferred acquisition costs will be written off and thereafter  if required  a premium deficiency reserve will be established by a charge to income 
changes in the assumptions for mortality  persistency  maintenance expense and interest could result in material changes to the financial statements 
reinsurance premiums from traditional life policies and annuity policies with life contingencies are generally recognized as revenue when due from policyholders and are reported net of amounts retroceded 
traditional life policies include those contracts with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits  and consist principally of whole life and term insurance policies 
for our traditional life reinsurance business  we estimate assumed premiums using actuarial model projections at the treaty level 
consistent with reinsurance industry practices  these models use the most recent policy level data available from our ceding companies and our estimate of new business for treaties still open to new business 
the estimated premiums from the models are then compared to historical trends in reported assumed premiums by treaty and other information and adjusted if appropriate 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the adjustments in a given period have generally not been significant to the overall premiums or results of operations 
however  in the second quarter of  we made an adjustment to reduce premium accruals by approximately million related to prior periods 
based on historical experience  the creditworthiness of ceding companies and our contractual right of offset  uncollectible assumed premium amounts have been infrequent and not material 
any provision for doubtful accounts would be recorded on a specific case by case basis 
the development of policy reserves and amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our products requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality  lapse  expenses and investment experience 
such estimates are primarily based on historical experience and information provided by ceding companies 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
management monitors actual experience  and should circumstances warrant  will revise its assumptions and the related reserve estimates 
present value of in force business is established upon the acquisition of block of business and is amortized over the expected life of the business at the time of acquisition 
the amortization each year will be a function of the gross profits or revenues each year in relation to the total gross profits or revenues expected over the life of the business  discounted at the assumed net credit rate 
the determination of the initial value and the subsequent amortization require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding the future business results that could differ materially from actual results 
estimates and assumptions involved in the present value of in force business and subsequent amortization are similar to those necessary in the establishment of reserves and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
our primary investments are in fixed maturity securities  including corporate and government bonds  asset and mortgage backed securities 
all of our fixed maturity and preferred stock are classified as available for sale as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the difference from amortized cost included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the difference is net of related deferred acquisition costs and taxes 
fair values for fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
for fixed maturity securities that are not actively traded  fair values are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services 
determining whether a decline in current fair values is other than a temporary decline in value for securities classified as available for sale can frequently involve a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded on established markets 
for instance  assessing the value of some investments requires an analysis of expected future cash flows 
management reviews securities with material unrealized losses and tests for other than temporary impairments on a quarterly basis 
factors involved in the determination of potential impairment include fair value as compared to cost  length of time the value has been below cost  credit worthiness of the issuer  forecasted financial performance of the issuer  position of the security in the issuer s capital structure  the presence and estimated value of collateral or other credit enhancement  length of time to maturity  interest rates and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market value recovers 
when a decline is considered to be other than temporary the cost basis of the impaired asset is adjusted to its fair value and a corresponding realized investment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income loss 
the actual value at which such financial instruments could actually be sold or settled with a willing buyer may differ from such estimated fair values 
as the discussion above indicates  there are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary 
these include subsequent significant changes in general overall economic conditions  as well as specific business conditions affecting particular issuers  future financial market effects such as interest rate spreads  future rating agency actions and significant accounting  fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments 
in addition  there are often significant estimates and assumptions that we use to estimate the fair values of securities  including projections of expected future cash flows and pricing of private securities 
we continually monitor developments and update underlying assumptions and financial models based upon new information

income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 for all years presented we use the asset and liability method to record deferred income taxes 
accordingly  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized that reflect the net tax effect of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes  using enacted tax rates 
such temporary differences are primarily due to tax basis of reserves for future policy benefits  deferred acquisition costs  and net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
future quarterly tax amounts will continue to be dependent upon the relationship between pre tax gaap profits and statutory profits and will also be impacted by the size and timing of certain statutory related deferred tax liabilities 
moreover  management will continue to assess and determine the need for the amount of the valuation allowance in subsequent periods in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
or in accordance with fin in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised fasb interpretation no 
and r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin and fin r  which was originally issued in january fin r addresses whether certain types of entities  referred to as variable interest entities vies  should be consolidated in a company s financial statements 
a company must consolidate a vie in which it has an ownership  contractual or other financial interest if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary 
a primary beneficiary has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected returns  or both 
we are the primary beneficiary of certain of the collateral finance facilities discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and have consolidated the variable interest entities in accordance with fin r 
the stingray investor trust  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  is a variable interest entity but we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary of the investor trust 
accordingly  it is not consolidated in accordance with fin r

the net realized loss in was million compared to a net gain of million in the majority of the realized losses related to the selling of investments in preparation of funding the ballantyne re transaction along with losses incurred from the rebalancing of an investment portfolio related to a specific annuity agreement 
the change in value of the embedded derivatives arises from the application of dig b which addresses whether sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires bifurcation of a debt instrument into a debt host contract and an embedded derivative if the debt instrument incorporates both interest rate risk and credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument 
under dig b  modified coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld reinsurance agreements where interest is determined by reference to a pool of fixed maturity assets are arrangements containing embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation 
in addition  reinsurance contracts with experience refunds are also considered to be arrangements containing embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation 
the change in the value of embedded derivatives increased revenues by million in compared to a decrease of million in the primary reason for the increase was related to the realization of losses on certain securities held under a modified coinsurance arrangement that were sold from the modified coinsurance arrangement in the first quarter of in order to provide collateral for the ballantyne re securitization 
net investment income increased by in to million compared to million in the increase in investment income is primarily due to the income on higher total investments from the new securitization structures  including ballantyne re  orkney re ii and hsbc ii  combined with higher interest rates 
expenses total benefits and expenses increased by in to  million compared to  million in the increase was principally due to million higher collateral finance facilities expense as a result of our regulation xxx transactions completed in december and may  reduced slightly by million due to lower letter of credit costs  higher than expected mortality  adverse lapse experience and additional operating expenses due to increased headcount  severance  legal fees  directors fees and other costs related to the sale of the company that could not be capitalized 
in addition  based on a reassessment of the in force and new business profits of the life reinsurance international segment  goodwill of approximately million was written off and approximately million of deferred acquisition costs were deemed unrecoverable 
the loss before income taxes and minority interest was million in compared to income before income taxes and minority interest of million in income tax expense in was million compared to an income tax benefit of million in the change in our effective tax rate in compared to is primarily related to a valuation allowance established on deferred tax assets during the year 
the valuation allowances primarily resulted from the actual results of legal entity statutory income and movements in statutory reserves for the period combined with a reassessment of certain tax planning strategies 
we generate deferred tax assets principally due to net operating losses  reserves and unrealized losses on investment securities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we must conclude whether the future realization of our deferred tax asset is more likely than not 
the evaluation regarding realizability of deferred tax assets is made on a gross as opposed to a net basis 
sources of support for the gross deferred tax asset are the reversal of deferred tax liabilities within the carry forward period which in the united states for life insurance companies is years  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
pursuant to the guidance under sfas no 
 we are currently unable to rely on projections of future taxable income 
therefore  we must rely on tax planning strategies for support of the gross deferred tax asset 
prior to the second quarter of  these tax planning strategies provided justification to support our deferred tax asset 
the combination of the increased pressure on our existing tax planning strategies  the operating loss for the period  and the prospects of a ratings downgrade during the second quarter led management to conclude that it was no longer more likely than not that the full amount of the gross deferred tax asset could be realized 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance of million during the second quarter 
during the third quarter we established an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets principally related to current period tax benefits not being recognized and an additional valuation allowance established on prior period deferred tax assets resulting from revised statutory and tax projections related to certain legal entities 
income tax expense in the fourth quarter of was principally related to an approximate million valuation allowance established on deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance resulted from a specific tax planning strategy no longer available to us 
in this regard  we have a deferred tax asset resulting from reserves and a net operating loss associated with the orkney i securitization 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a portion of this gross deferred tax asset was historically supported by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities within the carry forward period and the remaining portion was supported by a tax planning strategy 
the tax planning strategy involved our ability to request a change from the use of statutory accounting principles to gaap in the filings with the south carolina department of insurance 
this change would have eliminated the gross deferred tax asset relating to reserves and the net operating loss 
while the request would effectively put us back to the default method of accounting in south carolina  it nevertheless required the approval of the south carolina department of insurance 
in prior periods  we concluded that this tax planning strategy was both prudent and feasible 
during the second half of  we formally requested the south carolina department of insurance to approve such a change in our accounting basis 
however  in february the south carolina department of insurance indicated that our request for a change in accounting basis would not be granted 
accordingly  our tax planning strategy was determined to no longer be prudent and feasible and we established a valuation allowance of approximately million in the fourth quarter of at december   we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining gross deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance of million  will reduce taxes payable in future years 
at the end of the fourth quarter  the remaining gross deferred tax asset is supported by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities within the carry forward period and a tax planning strategy related to sfas no 
and management s ability to retain certain securities with unrealized losses 
future quarterly tax amounts will continue to be dependent upon the relationship between pre tax gaap profits and statutory profits and will also be impacted by the size and timing of certain statutory related deferred tax liabilities 
moreover  management will continue to assess and determine the need for the amount of the valuation allowance in subsequent periods in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
and fin comparison of to revenues total revenues increased by in to  million compared to the increase in premiums earned is primarily due to the acquisition of the ing business on december  and growth in the traditional solutions line of business in our life reinsurance north america segment 
the key drivers of the increase in investment income were the growth in our invested assets which arises from business growth and the ing acquisition  net proceeds of million from our offering of  non cumulative perpetual preferred shares in july and investment income earned on the invested assets from our regulation xxx initiatives completed during the year 
when analyzing the impact of net investment income on our results  it is important to understand that a portion of the investment income earned is credited to the policyholders of our fixed annuity products 
the interest credited to policyholders is included in expenses 
annuity product interest rate margins represent the excess of the yield on earning assets over the average crediting rate 
net realized gains were million higher in than improvements in the credit markets in resulted in less write downs for other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities million in as compared to million in we also realized a gain of million in compared to a loss of million for the same period in  resulting from the mark to market adjustment of an interest rate swap 
this derivative has not been designated as a hedge and  accordingly  changes in fair value are recorded in the determination of net income 
the change in the value of embedded derivatives decreased revenues by million in compared to an increase of million in this change in value arose principally because of the asset liability mismatch on modified coinsurance contracts assumed in the ing acquisition  coupled with a decrease in risk free interest rates and widening of credit spreads 
expenses total benefits and expenses in increased significantly compared to from million to billion or an increase of 
the increase in claims and policy benefits  acquisition costs and operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of the ing business on december  and continued growth in our life reinsurance north america segment 
growth in interest credited reflects an increase in account balances and crediting rates on these balances 
additional operating costs in resulted from increased resources to support the growth in our business and million of additional costs necessary to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of collateral finance facilities expense in is impacted by the increased regulation xxx financing transactions completed during the year 
interest expense increased in due to full year of interest on the trust preferred offerings  interest on the cypress notes and increases in libor rates during when analyzing the impact of collateral finance facilities on the consolidated results  it is important to understand that this expense is offset by the investment income earned on the fixed maturity investments from the collateral finance facility transactions 
the net margin represents the excess of the yield on earning assets over the interest rate costs associated with the collateral finance facility 
included in the tax benefit is a million expense related to the write off of a deferred tax asset related to state income taxes 
the income tax benefit is in respect of certain of our us taxable entities and our us entities  offset by income tax expenses arising on our irish entity and other us entities

comparison of to revenues premiums earned during decreased to  million compared to  million in a portion of this decrease was due to a curtailment of a number of large treaties immediately following the ing acquisition that did not meet our risk management criteria and a shift in business mix from coinsurance to yearly renewable term life reinsurance 
also impacting premiums were adjustments in the second quarter of related to revisions of certain estimates 
we recorded an adjustment to reduce premiums by approximately million as a result of a revision of estimates relating to this adjustment related principally to the ing block and resulted from the unusual activity in premium levels post acquisition which made the use of historical trends less effective in estimating current period accruals 
in addition  as a result of an initiative to improve the quality of our external retrocession data and related administration systems  we made a number of revisions to the estimates and underlying assumptions used in calculating our retrocession premiums 
as a result  during the second quarter of  we recorded an additional retrocession adjustment of approximately million 
in connection with our periodic internal review of the underlying performance of our treaties  we recorded a million experience refund adjustment that reduced our third quarter of premiums 
these experience refunds related to underlying profitability of specific assumed treaties  most notably within our ing block 
treaty provisions for these contracts permit our clients to participate in the overall profitability of the business  assuming certain financial measurement thresholds are met 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million collectability allowance pertaining to accruals for recoveries of retroceded premiums 
experience refunds on retroceded business were approximately million favorable in these experience refunds are directly related to our underlying mortality experience 
the above favorable amount partially offsets the adverse mortality experienced in  as discussed below 
finally  premiums earned in were lower than in due to the termination of new business on certain treaties  an overall reduction in new business volume and a decrease in renewal premiums as a result of the rating downgrades in mid traditional life reinsurance new business face amounts assumed was billion in compared to billion in investment income for increased to million compared to million for the increase was principally due to the growth in our average invested assets but also favorably impacted by an increase in interest rates 
our total invested assets have increased significantly because of growth in our life reinsurance north america segment  including the closing of a large equity indexed annuity contract at the end of and the investment of the proceeds of our regulation xxx transactions that closed in december and may the life reinsurance north america segment also benefited from a large portion of the proceeds from the december equity issuance which were contributed to this segment 
additionally contributing to the favorable increase is million of investment income on the previously described equity indexed annuity treaty which was substantially offset by fluctuations in reserves  interest credited and net acquisition costs 
our investment portfolio maintained an average quality rating of aa and increased its average book yield from in to in realized losses for were million compared to a million gain in the net realized loss for the year includes losses related to selling investments in the first quarter of in preparation of funding the ballantyne re transaction 
these gains were effectively offset by gains in the change in value of embedded derivatives 
the change in value of embedded derivatives for resulted in a million gain compared to a loss of million in the primary reason for the increase was related to the realization of losses on certain securities held under a modified coinsurance arrangement that were sold in the first quarter of in order to provide collateral for the ballantyne re securitization 
expenses claims and other policy benefits for increased to  million compared to  million for claims and other policy benefits as a percentage of net earned premiums were and for and  respectively 
in the first quarter of  although gross claims were within expectations in the aggregate  a higher number of smaller claims within our retention limit resulted in retrocession recoveries below our expectations  which resulted in approximately million of adverse mortality  principally within our ing block 
we experienced a similar situation in the fourth quarter of  although at a much lower level 
mortality was within expectations for the second and third quarters of but again adverse in the fourth quarter of by approximately million 
in addition to the lower than expected retrocession recoveries  the fourth quarter of mortality experience was due to a combination of higher claim volume and higher average claim size 
offsetting our adverse mortality in the first and fourth quarters were favorable experience refunds of million and million  respectively  which are recorded in premiums as previously noted 
for the full year ended  our actual net mortality excluding experience refunds was approximately of expected on over billion in claims 
our pricing and actuarial projection models include various lapse assumptions by treaty and by product type which are based on historical experience and industry expectations 
while our actual lapse experience during the third and fourth quarters of was only slightly lower in the aggregate than expected  we noted that the lapse distribution pattern was such that certain policies had higher than average lapses while others had lower than average lapses 
however  the policies with higher lapses had the higher margins and the policies with lower lapses had the lower margins  thereby reducing our earnings against expectations by approximately million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
related to the improvement in retrocession data and related administration systems  we revised our estimates based on refinements of certain of our calculations and processes for the net cost of reinsurance 
the impact of these changes resulted in an adjustment which increased our claims and other policy benefits by approximately million in the second quarter of during the third quarter of  and in connection with ongoing initiatives to improve the quality of our cedant information  we received updated claims totaling million relating to the and years 
although the increased claims from cedant reporting were largely mitigated by offsetting premium adjustments  they had the impact of artificially increasing the claims and benefits ratio for the year 
finally  as noted above  there was a reserve fluctuation on the equity indexed annuity contract of approximately million which impacted claims 
interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities increased to million in compared to million in the increase was principally due to the previously described equity indexed annuity contract written in late  along with increases in interest credited on existing treaties due to increasing average liability balances 
during the third quarter of  we terminated four funding agreements  resulting in a decrease to our interest sensitive contract liabilities of approximately million 
acquisition costs and other insurance expenses decreased to million in compared to million in acquisition costs and other insurance expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums for and were and  respectively 
during the second quarter of  we recorded adjustments of million to increase deferred acquisition cost amortization related to several deferred fixed annuity treaties in which emerging lapse experience was significantly higher than expected 
this adjustment was partially offset as we received a million rebate from ing as a result of the ballantyne re securitization a similar rebate of million was received in resulting from our collateral finance facility transactions

our deferred acquisition costs are principally related to our uk protection business written in late and given the relatively small amount of in force business in the life reinsurance international segment  the assessment of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs is very dependent upon projections of new business margins 
based on the impact of the rating downgrades and other market developments within the uk  we revised our estimate of the future margins on this business and determined that a substantial portion of our deferred acquisition costs were unrecoverable and  accordingly  a write off of million deferred acquisition costs was made in the fourth quarter of operating expenses increased by in to million compared to million in an increase in personnel costs in response to the anticipated growth in the life reinsurance international segment in addition to severance costs  including those related to the life reinsurance international segment head office relocation from windsor to london  were offset by reductions primarily in various professional services costs and adjustments related to non commission acquisition costs deferred

when we originate each new reinsurance transaction  the price and terms are based on results of simulation models in which projected investment cash flows will match liability cash flows within reasonable tolerances 
the investment portfolio characteristics found to be most suitable for the liability are used to design the investment guidelines and target duration for the portfolio 
we currently manage our asset liability processes for one hundred individual portfolios 
liquidity expectations and requirements vary with the type of liability 
for liabilities with potentially greater liquidity demands  we select more liquid assets and run more frequent simulations reflecting updated experience 
we periodically perform analyses  update guidelines and take other corrective action to keep the assets at the portfolio and enterprise level suitable for the relevant liabilities 
techniques include simulation of in force assets and liabilities in various interest rate scenarios  adjustment of duration targets for each portfolio  and monitoring the gap between actual and target duration at the portfolio  legal entity and enterprise levels 
historically  variations between the maturity of our investment portfolio and our liabilities have been small at the aggregate level 
funds withheld at interest portfolio funds withheld at interest arise on modified coinsurance agreements and funds withheld coinsurance agreements 
in economic substance  these agreements are identical to coinsurance treaties except that the ceding company retains control of and title to the assets 
the ceding company holds assets backing the statutory reserves in a segregated portfolio  which is managed by the ceding company or by investment managers appointed by the ceding company 
these treaties transfer a quota share of the risks 
the funds withheld at interest represent our share of the ceding companies statutory reserves 
the cash flows exchanged with each monthly settlement are netted and include  among other items  our quota share of investment income on our proportionate share of the portfolio  realized losses  realized gains amortized to reflect the statutory rules relating to interest maintenance reserve  interest credited and expense allowances 
at december   the market value of the assets representing funds withheld at interest totaled billion with an average rating of a an average effective duration of years and an average book yield of as compared to billion with an average rating of a an average effective duration of years and an average book yield of at december  these are fixed income investments and include marketable securities  commercial mortgages  private placements and cash 
the market value of the funds withheld amounted to billion and billion at december  and december   respectively 
at december  and  funds withheld at interest were in respect of seven contracts with four ceding companies 
at december   one contract with lincoln national life insurance company accounted for billion or of the funds withheld balances 
one contract with security life of denver international limited that accounted for billion or of the funds withheld balances  and one contract with fidelity guaranty life accounted for billion or of the funds withheld balances 
the remaining contracts were with illinois mutual insurance company and american founders life insurance company 
lincoln national life insurance company has financial strength ratings of a from am 
best  aa from standard poor s  aa from moody s and aa from fitch 
in the event of insolvency of the ceding companies on these arrangements  we would need to exert a claim on the assets supporting the contract liabilities 
however  the risk of loss is mitigated by our ability to offset amounts owed to the ceding company with the amounts owed to us by the ceding company 
reserves for future policy benefits and interest sensitive contract liabilities relating to these contracts amounted to billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the investment objectives for these arrangements are included in the modified coinsurance and funds withheld coinsurance agreements 
the primary objective is to maximize current income  consistent with the long term preservation of capital 
the overall investment strategy is executed within the context of prudent asset liability management 
the investment guidelines permit investments in fixed maturity securities  and include marketable securities  commercial mortgages  private placements and cash 
the maximum percentage of below investment grade securities is and other guidelines limit risk  ensure issuer and industry diversification  as well as  maintain liquidity and overall portfolio credit quality

we agreed to this amendment on august  on august   we received cash proceeds of million and issued  ordinary shares  which satisfied in full our obligation to deliver shares pursuant to the forward sales agreements and the forward purchasers obligations to pay us under such agreements 
an imputed dividend was charged to earnings based on the pro rated amount of time that elapsed from the original prepayment date until settlement date 
the balance of the discount reduced the net proceeds on issuance of shares 
upon the settlement of the forward sales agreements  we have received million in the aggregate and issued an aggregate  ordinary shares 
long term debt effective december   we executed an amendment to our bank credit facility agreement that permitted the payment of up to million from scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
to scottish re group limited 
the payment was transferred on december  these actions enabled us to repurchase nearly all of the million senior convertible notes which note holders had the right to put to us on december  we subsequently repurchased the remaining  in senior convertible notes that were not put in order to retire the full issue 
the notes were purchased at a repurchase price of of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts  if any  in cash 
shareholder dividends on july   the board of directors suspended the dividend on our ordinary shares 
all future payments of dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our income  capital requirements  insurance regulatory conditions  operating conditions and such other factors as the board of directors may deem relevant 
in accordance with the forbearance agreement with hsbc  we are prohibited from declaring any cash dividend  exclusive of the non cumulative perpetual preferred shares during the forbearance period from november  until december   unless at the time of declaration and payment of cash dividend  scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
has an insurer financial strength rating of at least a for standard poor s and a for moody s investors service 
collateral we must have sufficient assets available for use as collateral to support our borrowings  letters of credit and certain reinsurance transactions 
with reinsurance transactions  the need for collateral or letters of credit arises in the following ways o when scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd  scottish re dublin limited or scottish re limited enter into a reinsurance treaty with a us customer  they must contribute assets into a qualifying reserve credit trust and or provide a letter of credit to enable the us ceding company to obtain a reserve credit for the reinsurance transaction since these companies are not licensed or accredited us reinsurers 
o when scottish re us  inc enters into a reinsurance transaction  it typically incurs a need for additional statutory capital to cover strain from acquisition costs and increases in required risk based capital 
to the degree its own surplus is not sufficient to meet this need  we can make an additional capital contribution into scotitsh re us  inc or scottish re us  inc 
can cede a portion of the transaction to another company within the group or an unrelated reinsurance company 
if that reinsurer is not a licensed or accredited us reinsurer  it must contribute assets to a qualifying reserve credit trust and or provide a letter of credit in order for scottish re us  inc to obtain reserve credit 
scottish re us  inc 
has ceded significant amounts of business to scottish re dublin limited  relieving scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
of the need to contribute substantial amounts of capital to scottish re us  inc in connection with such cessions by scottish re us  inc to scottish re dublin limited  scottish re dublin limited must contribute eligible assets to qualifying reserve credit trusts and or provide letters of credit to provide scottish re us  inc with reserve credit 
o scottish re us  inc and scottish re life corporation are licensed  accredited  approved or authorized to write reinsurance in states and the district of columbia 
as a result  they generally are not required to provide collateral in order for their us customers to receive reserve credit  however  scottish re us  inc may agree to provide a reserve credit trust  security trust  or letter of credit to mitigate the counter party risk from the customer s perspective  thereby enabling transactions that otherwise would be unavailable or would be available only on significantly less attractive terms 
ing collateral arrangement pursuant to the terms of our acquisition of the individual life reinsurance business of ing  ing is obligated to maintain collateral for the regulation xxx and axxx statutory reserve requirements of the acquired business for the duration of such requirements 
we pay ing a fee based on the face amount of the collateral provided until satisfactory alternative collateral arrangements are made 
we are entitled to a partial rebate of this fee to the extent satisfactory alternative collateral arrangements are implemented prior to the end of in and  we completed three transactions that collectively provided approximately billion in collateral arrangements to fund regulation xxx statutory reserve requirements that were assumed in connection with the acquisition of ing s individual life reinsurance business 
the first transaction is a year collateral finance facility with hsbc that provides up to billion of collateral to satisfy regulation xxx statutory reserve requirements hsbc ii and is in addition to the facility with hsbc that was originally completed in hsbc i 
the second arrangement is a long term reinsurance facility reinsurance facility with a third party bermuda reinsurer which provides collateral to secure regulation xxx statutory reserve requirements in an amount up to billion 
the bermuda reinsurer provides security in the form of letters of credit in trust equal to the statutory reserves 
finally  in we completed the ballantyne re securitization in a private offering of billion of debt to external investors and million of debt to scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
these transactions have allowed us to secure within eighteen months of the ing acquisition financing for almost all of the regulation xxx reserves business acquired from ing 
these transactions replaced ing collateral and resulted in a refund from ing for fees incurred of million in and million in hsbc i in  we entered into a collateral finance facility with hsbc hsbc i 
this facility provides up to million that can be used to collateralize reinsurance obligations under inter company reinsurance agreements 
simultaneously  we entered into a total return swap with hsbc under which we are entitled to the total return of the investment portfolio of the trust established for this facility 
in accordance with fin r  the trust is considered to be a variable interest entity and we are deemed to hold the primary beneficial interest in the trust 
as a result  the trust has been consolidated in our financial statements 
the assets of the trust have been recorded as fixed maturity investments 
our consolidated statements of income loss show the investment return of the trust as investment income and the cost of the facility is reflected in collateral finance facilities expense 
the creditors of the trust have no recourse against our general assets 
as at december   approximately million of this facility was being utilized 
due to the rating agency downgrades after our announcement of earnings for the second quarter of  hsbc requested additional collateral under the total return swap agreements related to both hsbc i and hsbc ii see below 
in exchange for us agreeing to provide hsbc with additional collateral of up to million  hsbc agreed to forbear from demanding any amounts of additional collateral through december  to date  we have provided hsbc with million of additional collateral 
on november   we entered into an amended and restated forbearance agreement with hsbc  pursuant to which hsbc has agreed not to make demands for additional collateral under our collateral finance facilities with hsbc so long as certain conditions are met during the forbearance period which ends on december  this amended forbearance agreement will terminate if the transaction is not completed 
we will likely face demands from hsbc for additional collateral in this event  thereby further exacerbating our tight liquidity and capital position 
any breach by us of our obligation to post collateral could result in an acceleration of our obligations under these collateral finance facilities  which would require us to seek bankruptcy protection under applicable law if we were unable promptly to access alternative sources of capital

tartan capital limited on may   we entered into an agreement that provides two classes totaling million of collateralized catastrophe protection with tartan capital limited tartan  a special purpose cayman islands company which was funded through a catastrophe bond transaction 
this coverage is for the period january  to december  and provides scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
with protection from losses arising from higher than normal mortality levels within the united states  as reported by the us centers for disease control and prevention or other designated reporting agency 
this coverage is based on a mortality index  which is based on age and gender weighted mortality rates for the united states constructed from publicly available data sources  as defined at inception  and which compares the mortality rates over consecutive year periods to a reference index value 
upon the occurrence of a loss event  where the indexed losses exceeds the trigger level for a given tranche  the percentage of the original principal for each tranche paid to scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
increases linearly between the trigger level and exhaustion level

the liabilities have been included in the table above at the earliest redemption date 
life claims payable are included in reserves for future policy benefits in the consolidated balance sheets 
life claims payable include benefit and claim liabilities for which we believe the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable 
such amounts generally relate to incurred and reported death claims and amounted to million at december  as of december   reserves for future policy benefits of approximately billion related primarily to reinsurance of traditional life insurance and related policies and approximately billion of interest sensitive contract liabilities  primarily deferred annuities  have been excluded from this table because these amounts are generally comprised of policies or contracts where i we are not currently making payments and will not make payments in the future until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death or disability or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event  such as a surrender of a policy or contract 
the timing of payment on these liabilities is not reasonably fixed and determinable since the insurable event or payment triggering event has not yet occurred  and we have no control over the timing of such occurrence

these forward looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include o our ability to consummate the transaction including obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and shareholder approval and realize the benefits of such transaction  o the impact on our financial condition of the failure to consummate the transaction  o the validity of assumptions and methodologies used by management in analyzing potential run off scenarios and in predicting our further capital and liquidity needs and the inability to predict with certainty any future scenarios  o uncertainties relating to the ratings accorded to us and our insurance subsidiaries  o uncertainties in our ability to raise equity capital or other sources of funding to support ongoing capital and liquidity needs  o uncertainties relating to future actions that may be taken by creditors  regulators and ceding insurers relating to our ratings and financial condition  o the risk that our risk analysis and underwriting may be inadequate  o changes in expectations regarding future realization of gross deferred tax assets  o exposure to mortality experience which differs from our assumptions  o risks arising from our investment strategy  including risks related to the market value of our investments  fluctuations in interest rates and our need for liquidity  o uncertainties arising from control of our invested assets by third parties  o developments in global financial markets that could affect our investment portfolio and fee income  o changes in the rate of policyholder withdrawals or recapture of reinsurance treaties  o the risk that our retrocessionaires may not honor their obligations to us  o terrorist attacks on the united states and the impact of such attacks on the economy in general and on our business in particular  o political and economic risks in developing countries  o the impact of acquisitions  including our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses  the competing demands for our capital and the risk of undisclosed liabilities  o risk that an ownership change will result in a limitation on our ability to fully utilize tax net operating losses  o loss of the services of any of our key employees  o losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  o uncertainties relating to government and regulatory policies such as subjecting us to insurance regulation or taxation in additional jurisdictions  o risks relating to recent class action litigations  o the competitive environment in which we operate and associated pricing pressures  and o changes in accounting principles

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we measure and manage market risks and other risks as part of an enterprise wide risk management process 
the market risks described in this section relate to financial instruments  primarily in our investment portfolio  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  credit risk premiums or spreads  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
our investments  which are primarily fixed income securities  are subject to market value  reinvestment  and liquidity risk 
our invested assets are funded not only by capital but also by the proceeds of reinsurance transactions  some of which entail substantial deposits of funds or assets 
the cash flows required to pay future benefits are subject to actuarial uncertainties  in some cases  the policies that we reinsure contain provisions that tend to increase benefits to customers depending on movements in interest rates 
we analyze the potential results of a transaction  including the cash flows of the liabilities and of the related assets  and any risk mitigation measures  and we price transactions to cover our costs  including estimated credit losses  and earn a desirable risk adjusted return under various scenarios 
we use interest rate swaps and options as tools to mitigate these risks 
we may also retrocede some risks to other reinsurers 
interest rate risk interest rate risk consists of two components in a falling rate scenario  funds reinvested may earn less than is necessary to match anticipated liabilities  and in a rising rate scenario  cash outflows may have to be funded by selling assets  which will then be trading at depreciated values 
with some annuity liabilities  these risks are compounded by potential adverse selection by customers in exercising their surrender options in rising rate scenarios and the effect of minimum guaranteed credited rates in falling rate scenarios 
we mitigate both components of risk through asset liability management  including the technique of simulating future results under a variety of interest rate scenarios and modifying the investment and hedging strategy to mitigate downside risk to earnings 
our investment portfolio is composed of fixed maturity bond investments  of which the majority is at fixed interest rates 
for fixed rate investments backing reinsurance liabilities  the maturity structure has been designed to have approximately the same exposure to changes in interest rates as the related liabilities 
floating rate liabilities  including borrowings  are backed primarily by floating rate assets 
in the capital account  however  we own investments that are also sensitive to interest rate changes and this sensitivity is not offset by liabilities 
our overall objective is to limit interest rate exposure 
credit risk credit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest 
we measure and manage credit risk not only of bond issuers but also of counter parties in reinsurance  retrocession and hedging transactions 
in our investment portfolio  credit risk is manifested in three ways o actual and anticipated deterioration in the creditworthiness of an issue  as may be reflected in downgrades in its ratings  tend to reduce its market value  o our managers might react to the actual or expected deterioration and or downgrade of an issuer by selling some or all of our positions  realizing a loss or a profit smaller than would have been realized if the deterioration or downgrade had not occurred  and o the issuer may go into default  ultimately causing us to realize a loss 
one of our key objectives in managing credit risk is to keep actual credit losses below both the amounts that we have assumed and allowed for in pricing reinsurance transactions and the amounts we would have lost  given the general level of experience for comparably rated securities of the same type in the general market 
we seek to prevent credit risk  in the aggregate  from becoming the dominant source of risk in our overall book of retained risks as a reinsurer 
we mitigate credit risk by adopting an investment policy  approved by our board of directors  which limits overall exposure to credit risk and requires diversification by limiting exposure to any single issuer 
we also use outside professional money management firms and monitor their capabilities  performance and compliance with our investment and risk management policies 
foreign currency risk our functional currency is the united states dollar 
however  our uk subsidiaries  scottish re holdings limited and scottish re limited  incur operating expenses in british pounds  reinsure business denominated in us  dollars  british pounds  euros and other currencies  and maintain parts of their investment portfolios in euros and british pounds 
all of scottish re limited s original us business is settled in united states dollars  all canadian  latin american and certain asia and middle east business is converted and settled in united states dollars  and all other currencies are converted and settled in euros or british pounds 
the results of the business recorded in euros and in british pounds are then translated to united states dollars 
we attempt to limit substantial exposures to foreign currency risk  but do not actively manage currency risks 
to the extent our foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged  we may experience exchange losses  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may enter into investment  insurance and reinsurance transactions in the future in currencies other than united states dollars 
our objective is to avoid substantial exposures to foreign currency risk 
we will manage these risks using policy limits  asset liability management techniques and hedging transactions 
sensitivity analysis change in interest rates we regularly conduct analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rates on our financial condition 
techniques include  but are not limited to  simulation of future asset and liability cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and comparison of option adjusted duration of assets and liabilities 
on a monthly basis  we measure the gap between the effective duration of the investments and the target duration 
for assets supporting liabilities  we set the target duration to minimize interest rate risk for each liability transaction 
our investment policy limits the duration gap to years 
for floating rate borrowings and liabilities  we target floating rate assets  which have a duration near zero 
for capital account assets  we target a duration of years 
quantitative disclosure of interest rate risk the following tables provide information as of december  about the interest rate sensitivity of the portion of our investment portfolio managed by external managers 
the tables do not include other cash balances of billion  or funds withheld at interest of billion 
the tables show the aggregate amount  by book value and fair value  of the securities that are expected to mature in each of the next five years and thereafter  as well as the weighted average book yield of those securities 
the expected maturity is the weighted average life of a security and takes into consideration par amortization for mortgage backed securities  call features and sinking fund features 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million and a maturity of july on august   we terminated the swap contract for net proceeds of million 
this swap was used to manage a portion of the interest rate exposure on the balance sheet and had the effect of shortening the duration on our overall controlled portfolio by years or approximately equivalent to reducing our four year maturity exposure by million 
december  market interest rates were used as discounting rates in the estimation of fair value
