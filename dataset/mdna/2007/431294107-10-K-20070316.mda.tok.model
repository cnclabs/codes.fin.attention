beginning in the second quarter of  the industry began to observe another softening in property and casualty premium rates which has continued through in addition  the level of contingent commissions received by the company  which is based upon the application of certain factors  including profitability of the business  premium growth  total premium volume or some combination of these factors  is subject to annual fluctuations and cannot be reasonably predicted 
the company s revenues have increased primarily due to net new business and acquisitions  partially offset by lower contingent commissions 
the reduction in contingent commission payments can be attributed to the factors noted above and the elimination of national override commissions as a result of recent industry regulatory matters see contingent and national override agreements commissions for additional discussion

contingent and national override agreements commissions as a result of the industry and regulatory developments  controversy continues to surround the longstanding insurance industry practice of contingent and override commissions paid to agents and brokers by underwriters 
the company has historically entered into contingent and override commission agreements with various underwriters 
contingent commissions are commissions paid by underwriters based on profitability of the business  premium growth  total premium volume or some combination of these factors 
revenue from contingent commissions is heavily weighted in the first and second quarters 
income from the national override agreements was typically volume based and paid quarterly by underwriters in excess of the standard commission rates on specific classes of business 
national override agreements  as defined in the agreement with the attorney general  mean corporate wide compensation agreements negotiated by the company with certain insurance companies on behalf of all of the company s offices to receive commissions in lieu of standard contingent compensation arrangements with each office of the company 
for  and  the company recognized contingent and national override agreements commissions of million  million and million  respectively 
of the amount  was from standard contingency agreements and none were from national override agreements 
of the and annual amounts  and  respectively  was from standard contingency agreements and and  respectively  was from national override agreements 
the standard contingency agreements are entered into and maintained at the local office level 
effective for business written on or after january   these national override agreements reverted into standard local contingency arrangements with those underwriters on an office by office basis  which will be paid and recorded  if at all  annually beginning in early there can be no assurance that the loss of national override agreements commissions resulting from the reversion to standard local contingency arrangements will be offset by additional contingent commissions in future periods 
the departments of insurance of various states may adopt new regulations addressing contingent commission arrangements and disclosure of such arrangements with insureds 
in addition  the national association of insurance commissioners has proposed model legislation to implement new disclosure requirements relating to agent and broker compensation arrangements 
the company intends to monitor agent and broker compensation practices and  as warranted by market and regulatory developments  will review its compensation arrangements with underwriters 
while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and regulators  any material decrease in the company s contingent commissions is likely to have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
in addition to state regulatory inquiries  the company has been named as a defendant in a purported class action brought against a number of brokers in the insurance industry and a purported securities class action 
for information on industry and other litigation  see note q commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note a significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition the company is engaged in insurance agency and brokerage activities and derives revenues primarily from commissions on the sale of insurance products to clients that are paid by the insurance underwriters with whom its subsidiary agencies place their clients insurance 
generally  commission income and fees in lieu of commission  as well as the related premiums receivable from clients and premiums payable to insurance companies  is recognized as of the effective date of insurance coverage or billing date  whichever is later  net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations 
commissions on premiums billed and collected directly by insurance companies on its middle market and major accounts property and casualty business are recorded as revenue on the later of the billing date or the effective date 
commissions on premiums billed and collected directly by insurance companies on other property and casualty and employee benefits business are recorded as revenue when received 
contingent commissions and miscellaneous commissions are recorded as revenue when received 
service fees are recognized over the period which the services are rendered 
override commissions are recorded as earned 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to make required payments 
the company monitors its allowance utilizing accounts receivable aging data as the basis to support the estimate 
if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance may be required 
in addition  the company has the ability to cancel coverage for clients who have not made required payments 
intangible assets the company has acquired significant intangible assets in business acquisitions 
the valuation of intangible assets is subject to significant assumptions including projected future operating results 
the determination of estimated useful lives and whether the assets are impaired requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or sooner if impairment indicators arise 
the fair value of the reporting units is estimated by applying valuation multiples to the reporting units revenues and operating profits 
the selection of multiples is dependent upon assumptions regarding future levels of operating performance as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
when the fair value is less than the carrying value for the net assets of a reporting unit  including goodwill  an impairment loss may be recognized 
based on our testing  no impairment was identified for the years ended december   or however  since the estimated fair values are subject to change based on operating performance and other factors  future impairment charges are possible 
in addition  when impairment indicators are present  intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for recoverability using estimated future undiscounted cash flows relating to these assets 
stock based compensation the company grants stock options and non vested stock awards restricted stock to its employees  officers and directors 
compensation expense for all share based awards is recognized in the financial statements over the vesting period based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards 
income taxes the company records an income tax provision for the expected tax consequences of its reported results 
the company s provision includes deferred income taxes to reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company evaluates its ability to realize the deferred tax assets in the future and records a valuation allowance when necessary 
the determination of income taxes and assessment of realization of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment due to the complexity of tax laws and the company s operation in multiple states
