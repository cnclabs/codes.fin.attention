critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in the results for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements  and therefore should be read in conjunction with its summary of significant accounting policies see note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  prices are fixed or determinable  and ability to collect is probable 
the company considers the point of delivery of the product to be when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer 
the company s shipping terms dictate that the passage of title occurs upon receipt of products by the customer except for the last seven calendar days of each fiscal quarter  when all shipments are insured in the name of the customer 
for these seven days  passage of risk of loss and title occur at the shipping point 
the majority of the company s net sales relate to physical products 
these sales are recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as net sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales 
the company offers limited return rights on its product sales 
at the point of sale  the company provides for an allowance for sales returns  which is established based on historical experience 
amounts billed for shipping and handling are recorded as revenue 
pursuant to eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  when the company sets prices  has inventory risk and has credit risk  revenues are recorded gross 
third party extended warranties  third party software maintenance products and third party services sold by the company for which the company is not the primary obligor are recognized gross in revenues and cost of sales when the company sets prices and has inventory risk and credit risk 
if any of those criteria are not present  revenue and cost of sales are recorded net 
the company s warranty sales are generally recorded net 
when the sale is recorded  the company has no further obligation to fulfill 
the company only recognizes revenue when all criteria of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition have been met 
additionally  the company offers limited return rights within days on its product sales 
the company has demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on significant historical experience 
if actual credits were to deviate significantly from the company s estimates  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company had allowances for sales returns  net of cost  of  and  at december  and  respectively 
valuation of current assets  allowance for doubtful accounts and estimation of market inventory obsolescence 
the company uses significant judgment and estimates in the preparation of its financial statements that affect the carrying values of its assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of future collectibility of its accounts receivable 
the company regularly analyzes its accounts receivable in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined during the current period based on historical collection experience  customer credit worthiness based on published information  and other known factors 
the company maintains a valuation allowance for potentially uncollectable amounts due from its vendors that arise from product returns  standard vendor price protection programs  cooperative advertisement reimbursements and vendor rebate programs 
amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded based on the difference between the current market price of a product returned and its acquisition price  the denial of price protection  cooperative reimbursement  or vendor rebates due to noncompliance with specific attributes of the vendor programs 
the company regularly reviews its vendor receivables and provides a valuation allowance based on historical collections and the comparison of amounts recorded versus subsequently received 

table of contents the company records inventory at lower of fifo cost or market 
it estimates the amount of unmarketable inventory based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and the market value  which is based on assumptions of market demand  current market conditions  most recent actual sales prices  and age and condition of products 
accounting for income taxes 
the company is required to estimate income taxes in states in which it is registered and or has a physical presence 
this process involves estimating actual tax exposure while assessing temporary differences resulting in differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
the company believes that all net deferred tax assets shown on its balance sheet as of december   are more likely than not to be realized in the future and no valuation allowance is necessary 
in the event that actual results differ from those estimates or that those estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to record a valuation allowance  which would reduce deferred tax assets and the results of operations in the period the change is made 
goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that impairment exists 
the company performs the assessment annually on march the company completed the impairment review required by sfas no

sfas is effective for the company s fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
the intent of sab is to reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to quantify financial statement misstatements  including the effect of prior year uncorrected errors
