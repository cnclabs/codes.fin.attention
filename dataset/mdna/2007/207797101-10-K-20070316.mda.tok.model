part i item business the company the registrant  connecticut water service  inc referred to as the company  we or our was incorporated in  with the connecticut water company connecticut water as its largest subsidiary which was organized in connecticut water service  inc is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its six wholly owned subsidiary companies 
in  approximately of the company s earnings from continuing operations were attributable to water activities carried out within its regulated water company  connecticut water 
connecticut water supplies water to  customers in towns throughout connecticut 
as a regulated water company connecticut water is subject to state regulation regarding financial issues  rates  and operating issues  and to various other state and federal regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards 
in addition to its regulated utility  the company owns five unregulated companies  two of which are currently active and three of which were inactive as of december  in  these unregulated companies  together with real estate transactions within connecticut water  contributed the remaining of the company s earnings from continuing operations through real estate transactions as well as services and rentals 
the two active companies are chester realty  inc  a real estate company in connecticut  and new england water utility services  inc  which provides contract water and sewer operations and other water related services 
the three inactive companies are the barnstable holding company  a holding company which owns barlaco inc barlaco and barnstable water company barnstable water  barlaco  a real estate company in massachusetts whose entire inventory of land was sold in  and barnstable water  a company that was a public service company until its assets were sold to the town of barnstable  massachusetts in as a result of the sale of the assets of barnstable water  results of its operations have been classified as discontinued operations

the company completed these mergers on may  we currently treat each of the prior companies as divisions of connecticut water 
in july  the company filed a rate application with the dpuc for the newly merged connecticut water requesting an increase in rates of approximately million  or 
on january   the dpuc issued its final decision and approved a settlement agreement  negotiated with the office of consumer counsel and the dpuc s prosecutorial staff  that allowed connecticut water an increase of revenues of approximately  or 
the settlement agreement allowed connecticut water to defer part of the revenues on its books as it recognizes the increase in two phases through customer rate changes 
as part of the settlement agreement  connecticut water will also be able to recover carrying and operating costs related to a maximum of million of capital investments made in  upon a determination by the dpuc that the investments were made in the best interests of our customers 
additionally  connecticut water agreed not to apply for a general rate increase that would become effective prior to january  our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and weather variations 
the demand for water is generally greater during the warmer months than the cooler months due to customers high water consumption related to cooling systems and various outdoor uses such as private and public swimming pools and lawn sprinklers 
demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels from year to year and season to season  particularly during the warmer months 
in general  the profitability of the water utility industry is largely dependent on the timeliness and adequacy of rates allowed by utility regulatory commissions 
in addition  profitability is affected by numerous factors over which we have little or no control  such as costs to comply with security  environmental  and water quality regulations 
inflation and other factors also impact costs for construction  materials and personnel related expenses 

table of contents costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
since the enactment of the safe drinking water act  we have spent approximately  in constructing facilities and conducting aquifer mapping necessary to comply with the requirements of the safe drinking water act  and other federal and state regulations  of which  was expended in the last five years 
we are presently in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify existing filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
connecticut water derives its rights and franchises to operate from special state acts that are subject to alteration  amendment or repeal and do not grant us exclusive rights to our service areas 
our franchises are free from burdensome restrictions  are unlimited as to time  and authorize us to sell potable water in all the towns we now serve 
there is the possibility that the state of connecticut could attempt to revoke our franchises and allow a governmental entity to take over some or all of our systems 
while we would vigorously oppose any such attempts  from time to time such legislation is contemplated 
the rates we charge our water customers are established under the jurisdiction of and are approved by the dpuc 
it is our policy to seek rate relief as necessary to enable us to achieve an adequate rate of return 
as noted above  on january   the dpuc approved an increase of revenues of approximately  or  for connecticut water effective january  connecticut water s new allowed return on equity and return on rate base are and  respectively 
the following table shows information related to each of our divisions prior to the connecticut water s rate decision 
year of prior allowed allowed rate return on return on decision equity rate base connecticut water crystal unionville n a unionville s rates were based on a return on equity methodology  not a rate base methodology 
beginning mid  unionville began imposing a surcharge on its customers water bills to recover financing and operating costs related to the construction and use of a water interconnection with a neighboring water supplier 
our water systems our water infrastructure consists of noncontiguous water systems in the state of connecticut 
our system  in total  consists of approximately  miles of water main and reservoir storage capacity of billion gallons 
the safe  dependable yield from our active wells and reservoirs is approximately million gallons per day 
water sources vary among the individual systems  but overall approximately of the total dependable yield comes from reservoirs and from wells 

table of contents we supply water  and in most cases  fire protection to all or portions of towns in connecticut 
in  connecticut water s  customers consumed approximately  million gallons of water generating  in revenue 
the following table breaks down the above total figures by customer class as of december   and customers residential commercial industrial public authority fire protection other including non metered accounts total water revenues s residential commercial industrial public authority fire protection other including non metered accounts total customer water consumption millions of gallons residential commercial industrial public authority fire protection other including non metered accounts total connecticut water owns various small  discrete parcels of land that are no longer required for water supply purposes 
at december   this land totaled approximately acres 
over the past several years  we have been slowly disposing of such excess land 
for more information  please refer to segments of our business below 
additional information on land dispositions can be found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations commitments and contingencies 

table of contents competition connecticut water faces competition  presently not material  from a few private water systems operating within  or adjacent to  our franchise areas and from municipal and public authority systems whose service areas in some cases overlap portions of our franchise areas 
employees as of december   we employed a total of persons 
our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
segments of our business for management and financial reporting purposes we divide our business into three segments water activities  real estate transactions  and services and rentals 
as a result of the dpuc s final decision issued january   the company has reclassified certain items on the consolidated statements of income in order to reflect the requirements of the dpuc s final decision 
these reclassifications had no effect on income from continuing operations  however  there was an effect on income from our reportable business segments 
certain revenues and costs associated with antenna leases previously reported as non water sales earnings have been reclassified to other utility income 
additionally  certain costs associated with compensation of key employees are now shown in the other category of other income deductions rather than operation and maintenance expense  as previously reported 
these reclassifications had no effect on the overall income from continuing operations  but they allow the reader to compare results between years in a more meaningful manner 
these reclassifications have increased income from water activities and decreased income from services and rentals by approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the water activities segment is comprised of our core regulated water activities to supply public drinking water to our customers 
this segment encompasses all transactions of our regulated water company with the exception of its real estate transactions 
for additional information  please see reclassifications and revisions in footnote of the consolidated financial statements  found on page f our real estate transactions segment involves the sale or donation for income tax benefits of our real estate holdings 
these transactions can be effected by any of our subsidiary companies 
in february  the company sold acres of land that were owned by barlaco to the town of barnstable  massachusetts for million 
the company has recorded a gain on the bargain land sale of  during  the company had one significant land transaction 
connecticut water sold acres of land in bristol  connecticut for  resulting in a net profit of  
table of contents during  the company reduced after tax profit by  by recording a reserve for income taxes 
this was due to an examination by the internal revenue service irs  which was examining the fair market value of the property reflected on the company s  and tax returns 
the irs completed its examination during and no adjustment to the company s tax liability was needed 
as a result  the reserve of  along with an additional  in reserves was reversed in the company does not expect to make similar reversals related to tax reserves in future periods 
from to  crystal donated land to the town of killingly  connecticut for protected open space purposes 
in january  the last parcel of land was donated to the town of killingly for a reduction of income tax expense of approximately  in december  connecticut water made a donation of acres of land to the town of plymouth  connecticut for a new school 
as a result of legislation passed in  this donation was eligible for the connecticut corporate tax credit in the same manner as a donation for open space purposes 
the reduction of income tax expense from this transaction was  in  this amount was increased by  primarily due to a higher valuation reflected on the company s tax return as a result of an updated appraisal 
a breakdown of the net income of this segment between our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years is as follows income loss from real estate transactions from continuing operations regulated unregulated total our services and rentals segment provides contracted services to water and wastewater utilities and other clients and also leases certain of our properties to third parties through our unregulated companies 
the types of services provided include contract operations of water and wastewater facilities  linebacker  our service line protection plan for public drinking water customers  and providing bulk deliveries of emergency drinking water to businesses and residences via tanker truck 
our lease and rental income comes primarily from the renting of residential and commercial property 
some of the services listed above  including the service line protection plan  have little or no competition 
but there can be considerable competition for contract operations of large water and wastewater facilities and systems 
however  we have sought to develop a niche market by seeking to serve smaller facilities and systems in our service areas where there is less competition 
the services and rentals segment  while relatively new and a small portion of our overall business  has grown significantly over the past five years and now provides approximately percent of our overall net income in net income generated by this segment of our business was   and  for the years  and  respectively 

table of contents item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth below  any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or anticipated future results 
for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  see the discussion in forward looking information in item below management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements at pages f to f because we incur significant capital expenditures annually  we depend on the rates we charge our customers 
the water utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums for additions to or replacement of property  plant and equipment 
our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers 
these rates are subject to approval by the dpuc 
the company is entitled to file rate increase requests  from time to time  to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses  however as part of our recent settlement agreement with the dpuc  we have agreed not to request rate relief that would become effective prior to january once a rate increase petition is filed with the dpuc  the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly 
the timing of our future rate increase requests are dependent on terms of our rate case decision on january  and also partially dependent upon the estimated cost of the administrative process in relation to the investments and expenses that we hope to recover through the rate increase to the extent approved 
we can provide no assurances that any future rate increase request will be approved by the dpuc  and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that these rate increases will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase 
additionally  the dpuc may rule that a company must reduce its rates 
our operating costs could be significantly increased because of state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations  including the federal safe drinking water act  the clean water act and similar state laws  and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the us environmental protection agency and state environmental regulatory agencies 
these laws and regulations establish  among other things  criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the united states and or connecticut 
pursuant to these laws  we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations 
we cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in total compliance with these laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently 
these laws  and the enforcement thereof  have tended to become more stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits  it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will raise our operating costs 
although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that the dpuc would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such costs 

table of contents in summary  we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with  or discharging liabilities under  current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could affect demand for our water services and our revenues 
demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems  swimming pools  cooling systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal  or if there is more rainfall than normal  the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 
potential drought conditions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers uses of water and our financial results 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers 
drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers 
an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water  even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions  which may adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
any future acquisitions we may undertake may involve risks and uncertainties 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water systems in order to move into new service areas and to broaden our current service areas 
we will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates 
it is our intent  when practical  to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management s time and resources 
future acquisitions by us could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting  fluctuations in quarterly results  and other acquisition related expenses 
some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements 
the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process  including in the integration of 
table of contents controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting  could interfere with our operations  reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls 
in addition  as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries  the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions 
water supply contamination may adversely affect our business 
our water supplies are subject to contamination  including contamination from the development of naturally occurring compounds  chemicals in groundwater systems  pollution resulting from man made sources  such as mtbe  and possible terrorist attacks 
in the event that our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source or provide additional treatment 
we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
if we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective manner  there may be an adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates 
we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage 
for example  private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 
our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims 
the need to increase security may continue to increase our operating costs 
in addition to the potential pollution of our water supply as described above  in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks and the ongoing threats to the nation s health and security  we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
we have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
these costs may be significant 
we are currently not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies  however  it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur 
key employee turnover may adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team 
the loss of the services of any member of our management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results

in addition  connecticut water has an agreement with the metropolitan district commission mdc a public water and sewer authority presently serving the city of hartford and portions of surrounding towns  which provides  among other things  for the operation and maintenance by mdc of a filtration plant to supply up to  gallons of treated water per day for connecticut water s collinsville system 
collectively  these sources have the capacity to deliver approximately forty seven million gallons of potable water daily to the fourteen major operating systems in the following table 
in addition to the principal systems identified  connecticut water owns  maintains  and operates fourteen small  non interconnected satellite and consecutive water systems that  combined have the ability to deliver about one million gallons of additional water per day to their respective systems 
for some small consecutive water systems  purchased water may comprise substantially all of the total available supply of the system 
during  the company entered into  and the dpuc approved  a purchased water agreement with the south central connecticut regional water authority rwa to purchase up to one million gallons per day billed at the rwa s wholesale rate  pending the approval of all necessary diversion permits 
as part of the dpuc s decision to allow the purchased water  the company will be allowed to treat any purchased water as a regulatory asset

on may  the crystal water company crystal and unionville water company unionville  previously wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  were merged into connecticut water 
on august   connecticut water emergency services  inc  and crystal water utilities corporation  previously wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  were merged into newus  and chester realty  respectively 
in  approximately of the company earnings from continuing operations were attributable to water activities of its largest subsidiary  connecticut water  a regulated water utility with  customers throughout connecticut towns 
the rates charged for service by connecticut water are subject to review and approval by the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc 
on july   connecticut water applied to the dpuc to amend its rates for the first time in years  requesting approximately million in revenues  an increase of million  or 
on january   the dpuc issued its final decision and approved a settlement agreement  negotiated with the office of consumer counsel and the dpuc s prosecutorial staff  that allowed connecticut water an increase of revenues of approximately  or 
the settlement agreement allowed connecticut water to defer part of the revenues on its books as it recognizes the increase in two phases through customer rate changes 
as part of the settlement agreement  connecticut water will also be able to recover carrying and operating costs related to a maximum of million of capital investments made in  upon a determination by the dpuc that the investments were made in the best interests of our customers 
additionally  connecticut water agreed not to apply for a general rate increase that would become effective prior to january  in the future  connecticut water plans to file for smaller but more frequent rate increases 
the company s growth strategy continues to focus on the following investing in our water infrastructure and seeking timely recovery of that investment  marketing our services to private well owners who live near connecticut water s water mains  working with local developers to encourage public water use for new construction in connecticut water s service area  securing and retaining profitable operations maintenance contracts  acquisition of water and wastewater utilities  and expanding enrollments in linebacker  the company s service line repair program 

table of contents on a year to year basis connecticut water s earnings are primarily influenced by weather patterns that affect our customers water usage and thereby our revenues 
our revenues may fluctuate by as much as million or above or below a normal year because customers use more water in hot  dry growing seasons and less water in cool  rainy growing seasons 
regulatory matters and inflation the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve  and expand its service capabilities 
the cumulative effect of inflation over time results in significantly higher operating costs and facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
connecticut water is also subject to environmental and water quality regulations 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
we are currently in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify current filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
connecticut water s ability to recover its increased expenses and or investment in utility plant is dependent on the regulatory rates we charge our customers 
changes to these rates must be approved by the appropriate regulatory authority through formal rate proceedings 
the rates connecticut water charges its customers are regulated by the dpuc 
due to the subjectivity of certain items involved in the process of establishing rates such as future customer growth  inflation  and allowed return on investment  we have no assurance that we will be able to raise our rates to a level we consider appropriate  or to raise rates at all  through any future rate proceeding 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap and as directed by the regulatory commissions to which the company s subsidiaries are subject 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the company believes the following policies and estimates are critical to the presentation of its consolidated financial statements 
public utility regulation statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  requires cost based  rate regulated enterprises such as connecticut water to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their financial statements 
the state regulators  through the rate regulation process  can create regulatory assets that result when costs are allowed for ratemaking purposes in a period after the period in which costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise 
the balance sheet includes regulatory assets and liabilities as appropriate  primarily related to income taxes and post retirement benefit costs 
the company believes  based on current regulatory circumstances  that the regulatory assets recorded are likely to be recovered and that its use of regulatory accounting is appropriate and in accordance with the provisions of sfas material regulatory assets are earning a return 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue from metered customers includes billings to customers based on quarterly or monthly meter readings plus an estimate of water used between the customer s last meter reading and the end of the accounting period 
the unbilled revenue amount is listed as a current asset on the balance sheet 
the amount recorded as unbilled revenue is generally higher during the summer months when water sales are higher 
based upon historical experience  management believes the company s estimate of unbilled revenues is reasonable 
beginning in  the company will begin to record deferred revenues in the amount of million a year for a total deferral of approximately million 
the deferral will stop in april when the company will begin receiving a portion of the million deferral in rates  over a twenty year amortization period  and a return on the uncollected balance through rate base treatment 
benefit plan accounting management evaluates the appropriateness of the discount rate through the modeling of a bond portfolio which approximates the pension and postretirement plan liabilities 
management further considers rates of high quality corporate bonds of approximate maturities as published by nationally recognized rating agencies consistent with the duration of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the discount rate assumption we use to value our pension and postretirement benefit obligations has a material impact on the amount of expense we record in a given period 
our and pension and postretirement expense was calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
in  our pension and postretirement expense will be calculated using an assumed discount rate of 
the following table shows how much a one percent change in our assumed discount rate would have changed our reported pension and postretirement expense increase increase decrease decrease in pension in postretirement expense expense a increase in the discount rate a decrease in the discount rate outlook the company s earnings and profitability are primarily dependent upon the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels 
the company s earnings and profitability in future years will also depend upon a number of other factors  such as the ability to maintain our operating costs at lower levels  customer growth in the company s core regulated water utility business  growth in revenues attributable to non water sales operations  and the timing and adequacy of rate relief when requested  from time to time  by our regulated water company 
the company believes that the factors described above and those described in detail below under the heading commitments and contingencies may have significant impact  either alone or in the aggregate  on the company s earnings and profitability in fiscal years and beyond 

table of contents please also review carefully the risks and uncertainties described in item a risk factors and those described below under the heading forward looking information 
based on the company s current projections  the company believes that its net income from continuing operations for the year will increase from the levels reported for  primarily as a result of connecticut water s rate increase that was approved by the dpuc effective january  during and subsequent years  the ability of the company to maintain and increase its net income from continuing operations will principally depend upon the effect on the company of the factors described above in this outlook section  those factors described in the section entitled commitments and contingencies and the risks and uncertainties described in forward looking information 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources in recent years  we have relied on both internally generated funds and periodic debt issuances in order to fund our construction budget 
however  in the future  we expect construction expenditures will be in excess of cash generated from operations and funds generated from the company s dividend reinvestment plan  therefore  we will require additional external debt financings 
we expect that this funding will initially come in the form of interim bank loans  with refinancing into long term debt as the aggregate balance on the interim loans accumulate 
while the company considers both market interest rates and the availability of tax exempt financing opportunities through the connecticut development authority  we cannot be assured that the interest rates will be favorable to the company or that any new debt issuances will be tax exempt
