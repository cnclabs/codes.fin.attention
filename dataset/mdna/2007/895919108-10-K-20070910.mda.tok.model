the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we design  develop and market integrated circuits for digital media applications  such as digital television or digital tv  liquid crystal display television  or lcd television  and digital set top boxes 
our system on chip semiconductors provide the intelligence for these new types of displays by processing and optimizing video and computer graphic signals to produce high quality and realistic images 
many of the world s leading manufacturers of consumer electronics and computer display products utilize our technology to enhance image quality and ease of use of their products 
our goal is to provide the best image quality enhanced digital media integrated circuits at competitive prices to users 
we sell our products primarily to digital television original equipment manufacturers in china  south korea  taiwan and japan 
historically  significant portions of our revenues have been generated by sales to a relatively small number of customers 
our top five customers accounted for of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  substantially all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
our products are manufactured primarily by united microelectronics corporation umc  a semiconductor manufacturer located in taiwan 
since june  we have focused our business primarily in the rapidly growing digitally processed television dptv market and related areas 
since september   we have conducted this business primarily through our subsidiary  trident microsystems far east ltd  or tmfe  located in the cayman islands  with research and development services relating to existing projects and certain new projects  conducted by both trident microsystems  inc and its subsidiary  trident multimedia technologies shanghai co 
ltd  or tmt  located in shanghai  china 
operations and field application engineering support and certain sales activities are conducted through our subsidiary  trident microelectronics co 
ltd  or tml  located in taiwan and other affiliates 
trident technologies  inc  which was owned by trident at june   is in the process of being dissolved 
references to we  our  trident  or the company in this report refer to trident microsystems  inc and its subsidiaries  including tmt  tml  tti and tmfe 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by accounting estimates include revenue recognition  stock based compensation expense  investments  allowance for sales returns  inventories  intangible assets  product warranty  income taxes and litigation and other loss contingencies 
such accounting policies are impacted 
table of contents significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
for a discussion of how these estimates and other factors may affect our business  also see risk factors in item a 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive offerings and sales returns allowance in the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
our customer incentive offerings primarily involve volume rebates for our products in various target markets 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
a sales returns allowance is established based primarily on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors at that time 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
stock based compensation expense effective july   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options based on their fair values 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  which we previously followed in accounting for stock based awards 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab to provide guidance on sfas r 
we have applied sab in its adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors including stock options based on fair values 
our financial statements for the years ended june  and reflect the impact of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of stock based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended june  and included compensation expense for stock based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of june   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and compensation expense for the stock based payment awards granted subsequent to june  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we elected to attribute the value of stock based compensation to expense using the straight line method  which was previously used for our pro forma information required under sfas upon adoption of sfas r  we elected to value our stock based payment awards granted beginning in july  using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes model  which was previously used for our pro forma information required under sfas for fiscal year the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the black scholes model requires the input of certain assumptions 
trident s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of sfas r 
the expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is based on the observed and expected time to exercise and post vesting cancellations of options by employees 
upon the adoption of sfas r  we continued to use historical volatility in deriving our expected volatility assumption as allowed under sfas r and sab because we believe that future volatility over the expected term of the stock options is not likely to materially differ from the past 
prior to july   we used our historical stock price volatility in accordance with sfas for purposes of our pro forma information 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of our stock options 
the expected dividend assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
for the years ended june  and  stock based compensation expense  before income taxes  was million and million  respectively  which consisted primarily of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized under sfas r 
for the year ended june  stock based compensation expense  before income taxes  was million  which was recorded under apb 
table of contents prior to the adoption of sfas r on july  we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of apb and its related implementation guidance  and complying with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under apb  compensation expense is generally recognized based on the difference  if any  between the quoted market price of our stock on the date of grant and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
before our acquisition of the minority interest in our tti subsidiary  we estimated the fair value of non public common stock in our then majority owned tti subsidiary 
we relied in part on valuations implied from fairness opinions received in connection with tti related transactions  investment banking valuations at different points in time  the prices of occasional third party transactions in tti stock and interpolations between these data points to estimate fair value of the non public common stock at the date of grant of any options in these securities to employees 
we made these interpolations and estimates in good faith  recognizing that establishing a fair value is difficult and requires an appropriate degree of judgment and experience in the absence of an independent liquid market to establish fair value in any given security 
the fairness opinions and third party valuations in part relied upon valuation metrics of comparable publicly traded securities in taiwan 
these metrics change constantly and reflect the relative high volatility of these securities 
in general management believes that there is also a high correlation between the value of tti common stock and the us market based characteristics  such as volatility of the trident common stock 
this correlation was also factored into the valuation of tti stock for the purposes of measuring compensation expense 
as these characteristics and factors can vary over time  we used an average over a period of time to minimize potential distortion of the measurement at any one point in time 
investments we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas generally within our strategic focus  one of which is publicly traded and has highly volatile share prices 
for investments in privately held companies  we monitor the investments for impairment quarterly based on the investees most recent financial statements  which may not have been audited and may not have been timely provided to us 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
allowance for sales returns we maintain a sales returns allowance for estimated product returns based primarily on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors at that time 
if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates  the company may determine that additional sales returns allowance are required to properly reflect its estimated exposure for product returns 
inventories inventories are stated principally at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of cost first in  first out method or market net realizable value 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
when we introduce new products that are designed to enhance or replace our older products  we typically provide inventory reserves on our older products based on the expected timing and volume of customer purchases of the new product over a six month period 
the timing and volume of the new product introductions can be impacted significantly by events out of our control including changes in customer product introduction schedules 
accordingly  we may end up selling more of our older fully reserved product until the customer is able to execute on his changeover plan 
intangible assets we assess the carrying value of our intangible assets if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
with respect to long lived assets  various factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset or a significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time  relative to net book value 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals and industry trends 
actual useful 
table of contents lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we account for our purchases of acquired companies in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as developed technologies  are amortized to expense over time 
we assess the technological feasibility of in process research and development projects and determine the number of alternative future uses for the technology being developed 
to the extent there are no alternative future uses  we allocate a portion of the purchase price to in process research and development  which is immediately expensed in the period when the acquisition is completed 
this expense is generally estimated based upon the projected fair value of the technology  as determined by a discounted future cash flow reduced by the cost to complete 
this includes certain estimates and assumptions made by management 
for larger acquisitions  we engage independent valuation specialists to assist with the assumptions and models used in this type of analysis 
product warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based on historical information or specific product issues 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
as of june   accrued product warranty totaled million 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we maintain reserves for potential tax contingencies arising in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
such reserves are based on our assessment of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the potential loss from such contingencies  and may be adjusted from time to time in light of changing facts and circumstances 
these reserves are maintained until such time as the matter is settled or the statutory period for adjustment has passed 
adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that our reserves for tax contingencies are inadequate 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of changes to these reserves that are considered appropriate 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of june  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize all of our deferred tax assets before they expire  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carry forwards 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
litigation and other loss contingencies we account for litigation and other loss contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual losses from loss contingencies or restructuring liabilities are significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be materially affected 
we have been required to make such adjustments to these types of estimates in the past 

table of contents results of operations on october   the board of directors approved a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of november   payable on or after november  our common stock began trading on a split adjusted basis on november  unless otherwise stated  all references in the consolidated financial statements to the number of shares and per share amounts of our common stock for the periods prior to november  have been retroactively restated to reflect the increased number of shares resulting from the two for one stock split 
financial data for fiscal years ended june   and revenues fiscal years revenues by region change change dollars in million south korea japan china taiwan europe others total revenues by region are classified based on the locations of the customers principal offices even though our customers revenues are attributable to end customers that are located in a different location 
digital media product revenues accounted for all of our revenues in fiscal  after representing approximately of total revenues for each of fiscal years and the increase in digital media product revenues in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributed to continued success of our digital media products comprising predominantly our super video processor svp family of products in the digital television markets 
our unit sales volume of digital media products increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal  however  as is typical with consumer electronics markets  the year over year average selling prices decreased by approximately over the same time period 
the significant increase in digital media product revenues in fiscal was primarily attributed to the success of our digital media products in the digital television markets 
during fiscal  the volume of digital media units sold increased by more than while the year over year average selling price declined by approximately 
revenues from customers located in asia  primarily in south korea  japan  china and taiwan  accounted for an aggregate of   and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenues in fiscal increased in all regions primarily due to continued success of our standalone image process controllers largely in the digital process television markets 
revenues from europe in fiscal increased primarily due to the increase sales of svp cx to a major oem customer in europe 
revenues in fiscal increased significantly in south korea  japan  taiwan and europe  compared to fiscal revenues in china decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to intense price competition in that particular market 
we expect customers located in asia will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods 
during the years ended june  and  two customers each accounted for more than of total revenues 
during the year ended june   three customers each accounted for more than of total revenues 
substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in us dollars during all reported periods 
approximately of revenues in fiscal were generated through sales to distributors  compared to approximately of revenues in fiscal and of revenues in fiscal gross margin fiscal years dollars in millions change change gross profit gross margin gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to i product mix shift with a higher proportion of revenue associated with svp px which had a lower gross margin than some of our previous products and comprised of our total revenues during fiscal as compared to of our total revenues during fiscal  ii decreased 
table of contents revenue and average selling price from a previous generation product that had higher gross margin iii higher ramp up costs associated with our new products such as svp lx and svp ux wx  which were introduced in fiscal and in late fiscal  respectively 
gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased amortization expense of intangible assets relating to the acquisition of the minority interest in tti  completed at the end of the third quarter of fiscal in addition  we launched our svp px product in fiscal  which has a slightly lower gross margin than some of our previous products 
in fiscal  revenues from the sale of previously reserved products were million or of total revenues  as compared to million or of total revenues in fiscal and million or of total revenues in fiscal due to the previously recorded reserves  there was no cost of revenues reflected with respect to these product sales  which in effect  provided a benefit to the current income statement to the extent of the selling price 
at the same time  we recorded additional inventory reserves for fiscal in the amount of approximately million as compared to approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal sales of previously reserved inventory largely depend on the timing of transitions to newer generations of similar products 
when we introduce new products that are designed to enhance or replace our older products  we typically provide inventory reserves on our older products based on the expected timing and volume of customer purchases of the new product 
the timing and volume of the new product introductions can be significantly affected by events out of our control  including changes in customer product introduction schedules 
accordingly  we may end up selling more of our older fully reserved product until the customer is able to execute on its changeover plan 
we believe that the prices of our products will continue to decline over time as competition increases and new and more advanced products are introduced 
we expect average selling prices of existing products to continue to decline  although the average selling prices of our entire product line may remain relatively constant or increase as a result of introductions of new  higher performance products that may have additional functionality and that may or may not have higher relative gross margins as a percentage of revenues 
our strategy is to maintain and optimize gross margins by i managing average selling price erosion in pricing negotiations with customers  ii developing new and more advanced products that can add relative value to the selling price  iii reducing manufacturing costs by improving production yields  iv aggressively developing more cost effective products and v negotiating with the foundry and other manufacturing partners to receive more competitive pricing 
there is no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis or that we can reduce manufacturing costs or improve margins 
research and development fiscal years dollars in millions change change research and development as a percentage of total revenues the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of i increased new product development expenditures of million relating to our svp ux wx  svp ax and hidtv pro cx fx products  ii increased spending on additional personnel of million due to increases in headcount and salaries  iii increased depreciation expense of million due to purchase of additional property equipment and iv increased stock based compensation expense of million 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects revenues increasing at a proportionately higher rate than research and development expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to decreased stock based compensation expense of million  partially offset by i increased employee related expenses of million resulting from an increase in employee headcount  salaries and bonuses  ii additional tape out expenses of million due to increased research expenditures relating to our svp lx and svp cx products and iii increased facilities expenses of million 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to revenues increasing at a higher rate than research and development expenses 
we are currently planning to continue development of the next generation dptv products as well as other advanced products for the digital television market in the united states  japan  south korea  china  taiwan and europe  and therefore we expect research and development expense to continue to increase 

table of contents selling  general and administrative fiscal years dollars in millions change change sales  general and administrative as a percentage of total revenues the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i increased professional fees of million  of which million related to the cost of the investigation into our historical stock option practices and the remaining million represented legal  accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with our business operations and ii increased third party sales representative commission expenses of million due to increased product sales 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was attributable to increases in professional fees primarily relating to the cost of the investigation into our historical stock option practices 
although we will continue to monitor and control our selling  general and administrative expenses on an ongoing basis  we may continue to incur significant legal and other professional expenses related to the formal investigation into our historical stock option practices by the department of justice and the securities and exchange commission 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to i increased commission expenses of million due to increased product sales  ii increased employee related expenses of million comprising principally increased accrued bonuses of million  increased payroll taxes of million associated with stock option exercises  and increased salaries of million associated with additional headcount  iii increased professional fees of million primarily relating to higher audit fees of million for compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and higher legal fees of million due to the absence of the million benefit of a legal reserve reversal associated with the settlement of the neomagic lawsuit in our favor in fiscal  and iv increased amortization expense of intangible assets of million  partially offset by decreased stock based compensation expenses of million 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily attributable to revenues increasing at a higher rate than sales  general and administrative expenses 
in process research and development fiscal years dollars in millions change change in process research and development as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal  in connection with our acquisition of the minority interests in tti  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the amounts allocated to the acquired in process research and development were immediately expensed in the period that the acquisition was completed because the projects associated with the in process research and development efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and no future alternative uses existed for the technology 
as of june   the products developed with the acquired dptv and hdtv products technology are available for production with the exception of the hdtv pro product which is undergoing customer validation 
interest income fiscal years dollars in millions change change interest income as a percentage of total revenues the increases in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily attributable to an increase in cash balances in fiscal and  and to a lesser extent to improvement in interest rates 
the amount of interest income we earn varies directly with the amount of our cash and cash equivalents balances and prevailing interest rates 
other income expense  net fiscal years dollars in thousands change change other income expense  net as a percentage of total revenues 
table of contents other income expense  net included gain or loss on sale of stock of privately held companies 
the increase in other income expense net in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to i an increase in dividends of million received from umc  ii an increase in net currency transaction gains of million due to weakness of the us dollar and iii million gain on the sale of investment in afa technologies  inc in fiscal the decrease in other income expense  net in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a million impairment loss on investments in privately held companies  partially offset by million of net currency transaction gains and million dividend income in fiscal compared to a million gain on the sale of privately held companies in fiscal provision for income taxes fiscal years change change effective tax rate a provision for income taxes of million  million and million was recorded for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increased profits generated from our operations in foreign jurisdictions where we were subject to tax and the amortization of foreign taxes associated with intercompany profit on assets remaining within trident s consolidated group 
the increase in our effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in our foreign operations pre tax financial accounting income partially offset by a release of foreign operations valuation allowance 
a tax benefit was recorded in fiscal as a result of eliminating this valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle fiscal years dollars in millions change change cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax in fiscal  we adopted emerging issue task force issue no 
 accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for compensated absences  or eitf  which addressed the accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits and recorded a cumulative charge from change in accounting principle totaling million  net of tax 
in fiscal  the adoption of sfas r resulted in a cumulative benefit from change in accounting principle of million net of tax  reflecting the net cumulative impact of estimated forfeitures that were previously not included in the determination of historic stock based compensation expense in periods prior to july  liquidity and capital resources our financial condition remains strong 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at the end of each year were as follows in millions june  june  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments cash and cash equivalents short term investments total our primary cash inflows and outflows for fiscal years  and were as follows years ended june  in millions net cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating activities cash provided by operating activities consists of net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  cash provided by operating activities increased slightly  as higher net income  a reduced increase in inventories and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets after excluding a noncash transaction that significantly increased other current assets as explained in the following paragraph  was largely offset by increased accounts receivable and significantly smaller increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  the majority of the significant increase in cash provided by operating activities was from significantly higher net income net income in fiscal versus net loss in fiscal  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by an increase in inventories 
fiscal years  and included stock based compensation charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
on our consolidated balance sheet as of fiscal year end  prepaid expenses and other current assets increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the recording of prepaid taxes in connection with intercompany profit on assets remaining within trident s consolidated group 
excluding this noncash transaction  prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased primarily due to amortization of prepaid software license fees 
accounts receivable increased due to increased sales volume to our customers and timing of collections 
accounts payable increased primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued professional fees relating to the cost of the investigation into our historical stock option grants 
income taxes payable increased primarily due to the tax provision made for profitable operations in fiscal and foreign taxes resulting from the recording of income taxes payable in connection with intercompany profit on assets remaining within trident s consolidated group 
on our consolidated balance sheet as of fiscal year end  accounts payable increased from fiscal to fiscal due to increases in inventories and cost of revenues  which related to increased revenues 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued commissions and bonuses largely relating to our increased revenues and to an increase in accrued stock option exercise proceeds resulting from an increase in employee stock option exercises in fiscal inventories increased primarily due to anticipated customer demands for our products 
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and payments for stock of privately held companies  partially offset by proceeds from sale of stock of privately held companies 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to cash payments totaling approximately million for constructing our new research and development building in shanghai  china  which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal we also received cash proceeds of million from the sale of stock of afa technologies  inc in fiscal the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to million lower net cash used for the purchase of our tti subsidiary s stock as we have already purchased of ttt subsidiary stock in fiscal  partially offset by higher cash of million and million used for the purchase of property and equipment and of stock of a privately held company 
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from issuance of common stock to employees and excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
the lower cash provided by financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the approximately million decrease in cash proceeds from issuance of common stock to employees resulting from employees temporary inability to exercise vested options and the approximately million decrease in excess tax benefit from stock based compensation  partially offset by million net cash paid to employees in connection with the amendment of options to meet the requirements of united states internal revenue code section a section a
