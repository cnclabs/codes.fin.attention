overview ace limited ace is a bermuda based holding company incorporated with limited liability under the cayman islands companies law 
ace and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are a global property and casualty insurance and reinsurance organization  servicing the insurance needs of commercial and individual customers in more than countries and jurisdictions 
our product and geographic diversification differentiates us from the vast majority of our competitors and has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility 
our long term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income 
by doing so  we provide value to our clients and shareholders through the utilization of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets 
our senior management team is well seasoned in the insurance industry and its attention to operational efficiency  maintaining balance sheet strength  and enforcing strong underwriting and financial discipline across the whole organization has laid the foundation for sustained earnings and book value growth 
we are organized along a profit center structure by line of business and territory that does not necessarily correspond to corporate legal entities 
profit centers can access various legal entities  subject to licensing and other regulatory rules 
profit centers are expected to generate an underwriting income and appropriate risk adjusted returns 
this corporate structure has facilitated the development of management talent by giving each profit center s senior management team the necessary autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base 
we are an underwriting organization and senior management is focused on delivering underwriting profit 
we strive to achieve underwriting income by only writing policies which we believe adequately compensate us for the risk we accept 
we will not sacrifice underwriting income for growth 
distinction in service is an additional area of focus and a means to set us apart from our competition 
as an insurance and reinsurance company  we generate gross revenues from two principal sources premiums and investment income 
cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses  policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses 
invested assets are generally held in liquid  investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration 
we invest in equity securities in the us and international markets 
a small portion of our assets are held in less liquid or higher risk assets in an attempt to achieve higher risk adjusted returns 
claims payments in any short term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements 
the value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates  stock market volatility and credit events such as corporate defaults 
the actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends  inflation rates  court awards and catastrophes 
we believe that our cash balances  our highly liquid investments  credit facilities and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet any unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead 
the insurance industry is highly competitive  with many companies offering similar coverage 
the rates  terms and conditions related to the products we offer have historically changed depending on the timing of the insurance cycle 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  as defined by availability of capital  competition can result in lower pricing and less favorable terms and conditions 
during periods of reduced underwriting capacity  pricing and terms and conditions are generally more favorable 
industry losses from natural catastrophes were comparatively low in during and  the insurance industry experienced unprecedented natural catastrophe losses primarily from severe hurricane activity 
we incurred net pre tax catastrophe losses of million in  compared with billion and million in and  respectively 
we believe that major hurricanes like hurricane katrina will increase in frequency and have adjusted the models we use to measure catastrophe risk to reflect this  which in turn led to an adjustment in the prices we charge 
we also enacted a series of internal risk management activities as set forth by our enterprise risk management committee to temper the amount of catastrophe risk we will assume 
in the us  state governments responsibility to approve rates insurers charge for certain catastrophe coverages is undermined by populist political pressure to 
table of contents disallow rate increases  thereby distorting the true economic costs that should be borne by those living and working in catastrophe prone areas and forcing insurers to exit markets or restrict coverage 
insurance industry investigations and related matters information on the insurance industry investigations and related matters is set forth in note f to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include amounts that  either by their nature or due to requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap  are determined using best estimates and assumptions 
while we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment  actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are unpaid loss and loss expense reserves  including asbestos and environmental reserves a e  reinsurance recoverable  including our provision for uncollectible reinsurance  impairments to the carrying value of our investment portfolio  the valuation of deferred tax assets  the fair value of certain derivatives  the valuation of goodwill  and assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts 
we believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled unpaid losses and loss expenses  asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities  reinsurance  investments  net realized gains losses and other income and expense items 
unpaid losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company  we are required  by applicable laws and regulations and us gaap  to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers 
the estimate of the liabilities includes provision for claims that have been reported but unpaid at the balance sheet date case reserves and for future obligations from claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr at the balance sheet date ibnr may also include a provision for additional development on reported claims in instances where the case reserve is viewed to be insufficient 
the loss reserve also includes an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling these unpaid claims loss expenses 
at december   our unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were billion 
with the exception of certain structured settlements  for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable  our loss reserves are not discounted for time value 
in connection with such structured settlements  we carry reserves of million net of discount 
the table below presents a roll forward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses for the indicated periods

table of contents the process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments based on circumstances known at the date of accrual 
the following table shows our total reserves segregated between case reserves and ibnr reserves at december  and december  december  in millions of us dollars gross ceded net gross ceded net case reserves ibnr total the following table segregates the loss reserves by components including property and all other  casualty and personal accident a h at december  and in the table below  loss expenses are defined to include unallocated loss adjustment expenses and allocated loss adjustment expenses 
for certain lines  in particular ace international products  loss adjustment expenses are included in ibnr and not broken out separately 
december  december  in millions of us dollars gross ceded net gross ceded net property and all other case reserves loss expenses ibnr subtotal casualty case reserves loss expenses ibnr subtotal a h case reserves loss expenses ibnr subtotal total case reserves loss expenses ibnr total the judgments used to estimate unpaid loss and loss expense reserves require different considerations depending upon the individual circumstances underlying the insured loss 
for example  the reserves established for an excess casualty claim  asbestos and environmental claims  losses from major catastrophic events or the ibnr for product lines will each require different assumptions and judgments to be made 
necessary judgments are based on numerous factors  and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change 
hence  ultimate loss payments will differ from the estimate of the ultimate liability made at the balance sheet date 
changes to our previous estimates of prior year loss reserves can impact the reported calendar year underwriting results by worsening our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be deficient or improving our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant 
the potential for variation in loss reserves is impacted by numerous factors  which we explain below 
we establish loss and loss expense reserves to cover our liabilities from claims for all of the insurance and reinsurance business that we write 
for those claims reported by insureds or ceding companies to the company prior 
table of contents to the balance sheet date  case reserves are established by claims personnel as appropriate based on the circumstances of the claim s  standard claim handling practices and professional judgment 
in respect of those claims that have been incurred but not reported prior to the balance sheet date  there is by definition limited actual information to form the reserve estimate and reliance is placed upon historical loss experience and actuarial methods to project the ultimate loss obligations and the corresponding amount of ibnr 
furthermore  for our assumed reinsurance operation  global reinsurance  an additional case reserve may sometimes be established above the amount notified by the ceding company if the notified case reserve is judged to be insufficient by global reinsurance s claims department refer to assumed reinsurance  below 
we have actuarial staff within each of our operating segments who analyze loss reserves and regularly project estimates of ultimate losses and the required ibnr reserve 
ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate amount of expected claims for a product line and subtracting paid losses and case reserves for reported claims 
the judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses may involve the use and interpretation of various actuarial projection methods as well as more qualitative factors that may impact the ultimate value of the losses such as actual loss experience  loss development patterns  and industry data 
in addition  since standard actuarial projection methods place reliance on the extrapolation of historical data and patterns  the estimate of the ibnr reserve also requires judgment by actuaries and management to consider the impact from more contemporary and subjective factors 
amongst some of the factors that might be considered are changes in business mix or volume  changes in ceded reinsurance structures  reported and projected loss trends  inflation  legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts sold to our insured parties 
typically for each product line  one or more standard actuarial reserving methods may be used to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses and from these estimates a single point estimate is selected 
exceptions to the use of standard actuarial projection methods occur for individual claims of significance that require complex legal  claims and actuarial analysis and judgment for example  a e account projections or high excess casualty accounts in litigation 
in addition  claims arising from catastrophic events require evaluation based upon our exposure at the time of the event and the circumstances of the catastrophe and its post event impact that do not utilize standard actuarial loss projection methods 
the standard actuarial reserving methods may include  but are not necessarily limited to  paid and reported loss development  expected loss ratio and bornhuetter ferguson methods 
a general description of these methods is provided below 
in addition  we may use other recognized actuarial methods and approaches depending upon the product line characteristics and available data 
the historical loss and premium data required for these projections should be sufficiently homogenous such that the projections of future loss emergence from historical loss development patterns are representative of the underlying business 
for example  to improve data homogeneity  we may group product line data further by similar risk attribute for example  geography  coverage such as property versus liability exposure or origin year  project losses for these homogenous groups and then combine these results to provide the overall product line estimate 
the premium and loss data is aggregated by origin year eg  the year in which the losses were incurred or accident year and annual or quarterly periods subsequent to the origin year 
implicit in the standard accepted actuarial methodologies that we generally utilize is the need for two fundamental assumptions first  the expected loss ratio for each origin year ie  accident  report or underwriting and second  the pattern in which losses are expected to emerge over time for each origin year 
the expected loss ratio for any particular origin year is selected giving consideration to a number of potential factors including historical loss ratios adjusted for intervening premium and loss trends  industry benchmarks  the results of policy level loss modeling at the time of underwriting and other more subjective considerations of the product line and external environment as noted above 
for the more recent origin years  the expected loss ratio for a given origin year is established at the start of the origin year as part of the planning process  this analysis is performed in conjunction with underwriters and management 
the expected loss ratio method arrives at an ultimate loss estimate by taking this estimate of the initial expected ultimate loss ratio and multiplying by the corresponding premium base 
this method is most commonly used for immature origin periods on product lines where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet credible enough to override our initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratio 
in addition  the expected loss ratio may be modified should underlying assumptions such as loss trend or premium rate changes differ from the original assumptions  even if no credible loss experience has emerged 
our assumed paid and reported development patterns provide a benchmark against which the actual emerging loss experience can be monitored 
where possible  development patterns are selected based on historical loss 
table of contents emergence by origin year with appropriate allowance for changes in business mix  claims handling process or ceded reinsurance that are likely to lead to a discernible difference between the rate of historical and future loss emergence 
for product lines where the historical data is viewed to have low statistical credibility  the selected development patterns will also reflect relevant industry benchmarks and or experience from similar product lines written elsewhere in the company 
this typically arises for product lines that are relatively immature or high severity low frequency portfolios and for which our historical experience exhibits considerable volatility and or lacks credibility 
the paid and reported loss development methods convert the assumed loss emergence pattern to a set of multiplicative factors which are then applied to actual paid or reported losses to arrive at an estimate of ultimate losses for each period 
due to their multiplicative nature  the paid and reported loss development methods magnify deviations between actual and expected loss emergence 
therefore  these methods tend to be favored for more mature origin periods and for those portfolios where the loss emergence has been relatively consistent over time 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is essentially a combination of the expected loss ratio method and the loss development method  under which the loss development method is given more weight as the origin year matures 
this approach allows a logical transition between the expected loss ratio method which is generally utilized at earlier maturities and the loss development methods which are favored at latter maturities 
we usually apply this method using reported loss data 
the applicability of reserve methods will also be determined by the attachment point of the policy or contract with the insured or ceding company 
in the case of low attachment points typical of primary or working layer reinsurance  the experience will tend to be more frequency driven 
these product types allow for the standard actuarial methods to be used in determining loss reserve levels  as it is often customary to have the appropriate historical record and volume of claims experience to rely upon 
in the case of high attachment points typical of excess or excess of loss reinsurance  the experience will tend to be severity driven  as only a loss of significant size will enter the layer 
for structured or unique contracts  most common to the financial solutions business and  to a lesser extent  our reinsurance business  the standard actuarial methods need to be tempered with an analysis of each contract s terms  original pricing information  subsequent internal and external analyses of the ongoing contracts  market exposures and history  and qualitative input from claims managers 
our recorded reserves represent management s best estimate of the provision for future unpaid claims 
each product line has an actuarial reserve review performed and a provisional best estimate is established at the review s conclusion 
the process to select the provisional best estimate  when more than one estimate is available  may differ across product lines 
however  the objective of such a process is to determine a single best estimate that we believe represents a better estimate than any other 
such an estimate is viewed to support the most likely outcome of ultimate loss settlements and is determined based on several factors including  but not limited to segmentation of data to provide sufficient homogeneity and credibility for loss projection methods  extent of internal historical loss data  and industry where required  historical variability of loss estimates compared with actual loss experience  and nature and extent of underlying assumptions 
depending on the facts and circumstances of each product line  the determination of a single best estimate may be accomplished by selecting a single point estimate when one estimate is determined to reflect a better estimate than the other point estimates or using a probability weighted average approach when more than one estimate is viewed to be reasonable 
for example  an actuary may base the selected estimate on loss projections developed using an incurred loss development approach instead of a paid loss development approach as the best estimate when reported losses are viewed to be a more credible indication of the ultimate loss compared with paid losses 
the availability of estimates by different projection techniques will depend upon the product line  the underwriting circumstances and the maturity of the loss emergence 
for a well established product line with sufficient volume and history  the selected best estimate may be drawn from a weighting of paid and reported loss development and or bornhuetter ferguson methods 
however  for a new long tailed product line with limited company data and experience  the emerging loss experience will unlikely have sufficient stability to allow selection of loss development or bornhuetter ferguson methods and reliance will be placed upon the initial expected loss ratio method as the selected best estimate until the experience matures 
the actuaries evaluation process to determine a best estimate involves collaboration with underwriting  claims  legal and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees 
each business unit reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial  finance  claims and executive management and has the responsibility for finalizing and approving the point estimate to be used as our best estimate 
reserves are further 
table of contents reviewed by ace s chief actuary and senior management 
management does not build in any specific provision for uncertainty in addition to the actuaries best estimate in establishing reserves 
we do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates for our individual loss reserve studies 
in particular  ranges are not necessarily a true reflection of the potential volatility between loss reserves estimated at the balance sheet date and the ultimate settlement value of losses 
this is due to the fact that an actuarial range is developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas actual volatility or prior period development has historically been reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements  in part from events and circumstances that were unknown as of the original valuation date 
while we believe that our recorded reserves are reasonable and represent management s best estimate for each individual study as of the current valuation date  future changes to our view of the ultimate liabilities are possible 
if the past is any indication of the future and using recent actual claims emergence excluding a e  we estimate that our carried loss reserves at december   are unlikely to differ from the ultimate settlement of these liabilities by more than ten percent of the currently recorded amounts  either positively or negatively 
historically  including a e reserve charges  our reserves have developed in excess of ten percent of recorded amounts 
refer to analysis of losses and loss expense development  under item for a summary of historical volatility between estimated loss reserves and ultimate loss settlements 
we perform internal loss reserve studies for all product lines at least once a year  the timing of such studies varies throughout the year 
external loss reserve studies are performed periodically and compared to our internal results 
additionally  for each product line  we review each quarter the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations used in reserving 
if warranted from findings in loss emergence tests  we will accelerate the timing of our product line reserve studies 
the time period between the date of loss occurrence and the final payment date of the ensuing claim s is referred to as the claim tail 
the following is a discussion of specific reserving considerations for both short tail and long tail product lines 
in this section we reference the nature of recent prior period development to give a high level understanding of how these considerations translate through the reserving process into financial decisions 
refer to segment operating results for more information on prior period development 
short tail business short tail business describes product lines for which losses are usually known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs 
this would include  for example  most property  personal accident  aviation hull and automobile physical damage policies that are written 
due to the short reporting development pattern for these product lines  our estimate of ultimate losses from any particular accident period responds quickly to the latest loss data 
we will typically assign credibility to methods that incorporate actual loss emergence  such as the paid and reported loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods  sooner than would be the case for long tail lines at a similar stage of development from the origin year 
the reserving process for short tail losses arising from catastrophic events typically involves the determination by the claims department  in conjunction with underwriters and actuaries  of our exposure and likely losses immediately following an event and the subsequent regular refinement of those losses as our insureds provide updated actual loss information 
for short tail lines  the bulk of prior period development movements made in the calendar year related to the accident year 
specifically  the insurance north american and global reinsurance segments experienced adverse development related to catastrophes and the insurance overseas general segment experienced favorable development due to lower than anticipated loss emergence during in both instances  these prior period movements were primarily the result of changes to the ultimate loss estimates for the accident year to better reflect the latest reported loss data rather than any changes to underlying actuarial assumptions 
long tail business long tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known for some period and claims can take significant time to emerge 
this includes most casualty lines such as general liability  directors and officers liability d o and workers compensation 
there are many factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long tail business 
among these are given the recent expansion of this business  our historical loss data and experience is often too immature to place reliance upon for reserving purposes 
instead  particularly for newer lines of business  reserve methods are based on industry loss ratios or industry benchmark development patterns that are anticipated to reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development 
for new or growing lines of business  actual loss 
table of contents experience is apt to differ from industry loss statistics that are based on averages as well as loss experience of previous underwriting years  the inherent uncertainty of the estimated duration of the paid and reporting loss development patterns beyond the historical record requires that professional judgment be used in the determination of the length of the patterns based on the historical data and other information  the inherent uncertainty of assuming historical paid and reporting loss development patterns on older origin years will be representative of subsequent loss emergence on newer origin years 
for example  changes in establishing case reserves can distort reported loss development patterns or changes in ceded reinsurance structures by origin year can distort the development of paid and reported losses  the possibility of future litigation  legislative or judicial change that might impact future loss experience relative to prior loss experience relied upon in loss reserve analyses  loss reserve analyses typically require loss or other data be grouped by common characteristics in some manner 
if data from two combined lines of business exhibit different characteristics  such as loss payment patterns  the credibility of the reserve estimate could be affected 
additionally  since casualty lines of business can have significant intricacies in the terms and conditions afforded to the insured  there is an inherent risk as to the homogeneity of the underlying data used in performing reserve analyses 
the applicability of the price change data used to estimate ultimate loss ratios for most recent origin years 
in contrast to short tail lines  the prior period development in for long tail lines of business arose across a number of accident years in the insurance north american and insurance overseas general segments  typically more removed from the recent accident years 
the movements were generally the result of actual loss emergence within the calendar year that differed materially from the expected loss emergence and these deviations were significant enough in certain product lines to warrant revising the projections 
however  for a number of long tail portfolios  to the extent that actual loss emergence in calendar year differed from our expectation in the more recent origin years  the deviation was not seen as sufficiently credible to alter either our ultimate loss selections or the set of actuarial assumptions underlying the reserving review for that particular portfolio 
such judgments were made with due consideration to the factors impacting reserve uncertainty as discussed above 
we continually evaluate our reserve estimates taking into account current information 
we estimate the ultimate loss amounts by projecting losses as of the valuation date using loss development patterns derived from historical data 
in addition  a tail factor is applied to the projected loss amount to reflect further potential development beyond the period of historical record 
while we believe our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december   is adequate  new information or trends  such as judicial action broadening the scope of coverage or expanding liability  may lead to future developments in ultimate losses and loss expenses significantly greater or less than the reserve provided  which could have a material adverse effect on future operating results 
particularly significant variables for which a change in assumption could have a material effect on unpaid losses and loss expenses include  but are not limited to  the items discussed above 
as noted previously  our best estimate of required loss reserves for most portfolios is judgmentally selected for each origin year after considering the results from any number of reserving methodologies rather than being a purely mechanical process 
therefore  it is difficult to convey  in a simple and quantitative manner  the impact that a change to a single assumption will have on our best estimate 
in the examples shown below  we attempt to give an indication of the potential impact by isolating a single change for a specific reserving method that would be pertinent in establishing the best estimate for the product line described 
we consider each of the following sensitivity analyses to represent a reasonably likely deviation in the underlying assumption 
insurance north american given the long reporting and paid development pattern  the tail factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for claims covered by our inactive middle market workers compensation business requires considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves 
specifically  when applying the paid loss development method  a one percent change in the tail factor ie  changed to either or would cause a change of approximately million  either positively or negatively  for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves 
this is relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately million 
our ace bermuda operations write predominantly high excess liability coverage on an occurrence first reported basis typically with attachment points in excess of million and limits of million gross or less and d o and other professional liability coverage on a claims made basis typically with attachment points in excess of million 
table of contents and limits of million gross or less 
claims development for this business can vary significantly for individual claims and historically could vary by as much as million per claim for professional liability and million per claim for excess liability depending on the nature of the loss 
insurance overseas general certain long tail lines  such as casualty and professional lines  are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation 
heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world are increasing the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty of the reserving estimates 
our reserving methods rely heavily on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment  it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments 
for example  when applying the reported loss development method  the lengthening by six months of our selected loss development patterns would increase reserve estimates on long tail casualty and professional lines by approximately million 
this movement is relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately billion 
global reinsurance typically  there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reporting development patterns  especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers compensation or general liability  which may take up to years to fully develop 
this uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns as justified by the credibility of the data 
the underlying source and selection of the final development pattern can thus have a significant impact on the selected net losses and loss expenses ultimate 
for example  a twenty percent slowing or quickening shortening or lengthening as above of the development patterns used for us long tail lines would cause the loss reserve estimate derived by the reported bornhuetter ferguson method for these lines to change by approximately million 
this movement is relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately billion 
assumed reinsurance at december   net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to billion  consisting of million of case reserves and billion of ibnr 
in comparison  at december   net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to billion  consisting of million of case reserves and billion of ibnr 
prior to  our reinsurance operations had been concentrated in the property catastrophe reinsurance market 
for catastrophe business  we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information  including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants  ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers  and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event 
our internal data analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves 
in  we began writing casualty lines of reinsurance in the united states  and to a lesser extent  europe  asia  and australia 
given the long tail nature of this business  these new lines have both increased the amount of reserves in the global reinsurance segment as well as the uncertainty in the loss estimation process 
for our casualty reinsurance business  we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses 
due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies  as well as other factors  the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business 
these include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following the reported claims information could be inaccurate  typically  a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim 
the use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag 
because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers  ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers  who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty 
the reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations 
therefore  the risk of 
table of contents delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines  the historical claims data for a particular reinsurance contract can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available 
furthermore  for certain coverages provided by products  such as excess of loss contracts  there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability 
in such cases  the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources 
we mitigate the above risks in several ways 
in addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable  we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate  complete  and timely 
as appropriate  audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process 
we also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses 
on occasion  there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premiums reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premiums reserves reported by the ceding companies 
this is due to the fact that we receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies only with respect to case reserves 
for ibnr  we use historical experience and other statistical information  depending on the type of business  to estimate the ultimate loss see unpaid losses and loss expenses for more information 
we estimate our unearned premiums reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treaty s coverage basis ie  risks attaching or losses occurring 
at december   the case reserves reported to us by our ceding companies were million  compared with the million we recorded 
our policy is to post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant 
within the insurance north american segment  we also have exposure to certain liability reinsurance lines that have been in run off since unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run off reinsurance business resides within the brandywine division of our insurance north american segment 
most of the remaining unpaid losses and loss expense reserves for the run off reinsurance business relate to asbestos and environmental claims 
refer to asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities for more information 
asbestos and environmental reserves included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are liabilities for asbestos and environmental claims and expenses a e 
these claims are principally related to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily injury claims related to exposure to asbestos products and environmental hazards 
the estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to the recent legal environment  including specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims 
our a e reserves and our range of estimates are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated changes in the legal  social or economic environment  or any benefit from future legislative reforms 
accordingly  our a e reserves make no allowance for future state or federal asbestos reforms  such as those currently being contemplated 
during  we conducted an internal  ground up review of our consolidated a e liabilities as of june  during the same period  a team of external actuaries performed an evaluation as to the adequacy of the reserves of century and those liabilities of ace american reinsurance company ace american re retained and not sold 
the century external review was conducted in accordance with the brandywine restructuring order  which requires that an external actuarial review of century s reserves be completed every two years 
as a result of the internal review  we concluded that our net loss reserves for the brandywine operations were adequate and  therefore  no change to the carried net reserve was required  while the gross loss reserves increased by approximately million 
the conclusions of the external review provided estimates of ultimate gross and net brandywine liabilities that are lower than the same study in as a result  the difference in net loss reserves between the internal and external studies has narrowed to approximately million million after tax from million million after tax in 
there are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome 
we believe the most significant variables relating to our a e reserves include assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims  the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure  the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to non products coverage  whether high level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholders claim trends and liability situation  and payments to unimpaired claimants and the potential liability of peripheral defendants 
based on the policies  the facts  the law and a careful 
table of contents analysis of the impact that these factors will likely have on any given account  we estimate the potential liability for indemnity  policyholder defense costs and coverage litigation expense 
the results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carrier  policyholder and claimants

reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable includes the balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses  and is presented net of a provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors 
we determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts 
the recognition of a reinsurance recoverable asset requires two key judgments 
the first judgment involves our estimation based on the amount of gross reserves and the percentage of that amount which may be ceded to reinsurers 
ceded ibnr  which is a major component of the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses  is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and consequently  its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross ibnr refer to critical accounting estimates unpaid losses and loss expenses 
the second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we may ultimately be unable to recover from reinsurers due to insolvency  contractual dispute  or for other reasons 
amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable asset and  in turn  shareholders equity 
changes in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance are reflected in net income 
although the contractual obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions  the collectability of such amounts requires estimation by management 
the majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until sometime in the future  in some cases several decades from now 
over this period of time  economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so  they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us 
to estimate the provision for uncollectible reinsurance  the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer 
this determination is based on a process rather than an estimate  although an element of judgment must be applied 
as part of the process  ceded ibnr is allocated to reinsurance contracts because ceded ibnr is not generally calculated on a contract by contract basis 
the allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance contracts  adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses 
if actual experience varies materially from historical experience  including that used to determine ceded premium  the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will change 
while such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance  it could  nevertheless  have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded 
generally  we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance 
the primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer  net of collateral  and default factors used to estimate the probability that the reinsurer may be unable to meet its future obligations in full 
the definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in an ace only beneficiary trust  letters of credit  and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset 
we do not currently include multi beneficiary trusts 
however  we have several reinsurers that have established multi beneficiary trusts for which certain of our companies are beneficiaries 
the determination of the default factor is principally based on the financial strength rating of the reinsurer and a corresponding default factor applicable to the financial strength rating 
default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current financial strength rating  or rating equivalent  of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions 
significant considerations and assumptions include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following for reinsurers that maintain a financial strength rating from a major rating agency  and for which recoverable balances are considered representative of the larger population ie  default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages  the judgment exercised by management to determine 
table of contents the provision for uncollectible reinsurance of each reinsurer is typically limited because the financial rating is based on a published source and the default factor we apply is based on a default factor of a major rating agency applicable to the particular rating class 
default factors applied for financial ratings of aaa  aa  a  bbb  bb  b and ccc  are percent  percent  percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 
because the model we use is predicated on the default factors of a major rating agency  we do not generally consider alternative factors 
however  when a recoverable is expected to be paid in a brief period of time by a highly rated reinsurer  such as certain property catastrophe claims  a default factor may not be applied  for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent  affiliate or peer company  we determine a rating equivalent based on an analysis of the reinsurer that considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity  industry benchmarks  or other factors as considered appropriate 
we then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class 
for balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which our ceded reserve is below a certain threshold  we generally apply a default factor of percent  for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are either insolvent or under regulatory supervision  we establish a default factor and resulting provision for uncollectible reinsurance based on specific facts and circumstances surrounding each company 
upon initial notification of an insolvency  we generally recognize expense for a substantial portion of all balances outstanding  net of collateral  through a combination of write offs of recoverable balances and increases to the provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
when regulatory action is taken on a reinsurer  we generally recognize a default factor by estimating an expected recovery on all balances outstanding  net of collateral 
when sufficient credible information becomes available  we adjust the provision for uncollectible reinsurance by establishing a default factor pursuant to information received  for captives and other recoverables  management determines the provision for uncollectible reinsurance based on the specific facts and circumstances 
the following table summarizes reinsurance recoverables and the provision for uncollectible reinsurance for each type of recoverable balance at december  in millions of us dollars total reinsurance recoverables recoverables net of usable collateral provision for uncollectible reinsurance type reinsurers with credit ratings reinsurers not rated reinsurers under supervision and insolvent reinsurers captives other structured settlements and pools total at december   the use of different assumptions within our approach could have a material effect on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
to the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers were to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry  such as a large number of major catastrophes  actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and our liquidity 
given the various considerations used to estimate our uncollectible provision  we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
however  based on the composition particularly the average credit quality of the reinsurance recoverable balance at december   we estimate that a ratings downgrade of one notch for all rated reinsurers ie  from a to a or a to bbb could increase our provision for uncollectible reinsurance by approximately million or approximately one percent of the reinsurance recoverable balance  assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation 
while a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in our provision for uncollectible reinsurance and a charge to earnings in that period  a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will not ultimately collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question

table of contents investments our fixed maturity investments are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
our available for sale portfolio is reported at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in shareholders equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
fair value is determined using the quoted market price of these securities provided by either independent pricing services  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications 
we regularly review our impaired investments ie  those debt securities in which fair value is below amortized cost or those equity securities in which fair value is below cost for a possible other than temporary impairment 
if we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary  we record the decline as an unrealized loss in our shareholders equity 
if we believe the decline is other than temporary  we write down the book value of the investment and record a realized loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
an impairment is considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment to recovery of the cost of the investment  and evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period outweighs evidence to the contrary 
the determination as to whether or not the decline is other than temporary principally requires the following critical judgments i the circumstances that require management to make a specific assessment as to whether or not the decline is other than temporary  such as the time period an investment has been in a loss position and the significance of the decline  and ii for those securities to be assessed  whether we have the ability and intent to hold the security through an expected recovery period  absent a significant change in facts that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on either the financial markets or the financial position of the issuer 
with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
subsequent decisions on security sales could be made based on changes in liquidity needs ie  arising from a large insured loss such as a catastrophe  internal risk management considerations  the financial condition of the issuer or its industry  market conditions  and new investment opportunities 
day to day management of the majority of our investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers 
while these investment managers may  at a given point in time  believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses until such losses are recovered  the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss based upon new circumstances such as those related to the changes described above 
we believe that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of the majority of our portfolio as available for sale 
the gross unrealized loss at december   for all securities in a loss position was million with million in an unrealized loss position for over months of which million related to fixed maturities held to maturity 
our net realized losses in included write downs of million of which million was related to fixed maturities 
this compares with write downs of million and million in and  respectively 
the impairments recorded in are primarily due to an increase in market interest rates from the date of security purchase and as such  are not credit related 
because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets and a multiple of shareholders equity  adverse changes in economic conditions subsequent to the balance sheet date could result in other than temporary impairments that are material to our financial condition and operating results 
such economic changes could arise from overall changes in the financial markets and specific changes to industries  companies  or foreign governments in which we maintain relatively large investment holdings 
further  an increase in interest rates could result in an increased number of fixed maturities for which we cannot support the intent to hold to recovery 
more information regarding our process for reviewing our portfolio for possible impairments can be found in the section entitled net realized gains losses 
deferred tax assets many of our insurance businesses operate in income tax paying jurisdictions 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax paying component an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each tax jurisdiction 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was billion 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
at each balance sheet date  management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax 
table of contents assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction  principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies 
projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience 
if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax paying component proves to be incorrect  an additional valuation allowance could become necessary 
this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
at december   the valuation allowance of million including million with respect to foreign tax credits reflects management s assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the inability of certain foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income or the inability to utilize foreign tax credits 
derivatives statement of financial accounting standard fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
fas requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and be measured at fair value  with changes in fair value reflected in net income 
for a sensitivity discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates and equity indices on the fair value of derivatives and the resulting impact on our net income  refer to item a 
we do not designate any derivatives as accounting hedges 
our principal participation in derivative instruments is as follows i to sell protection to customers as either the writer of a derivative financial instrument or an insurance or reinsurance contract that meets the definition of a derivative 
the reinsurance of guaranteed minimum income benefits gmibs in our life reinsurance operation is our primary product falling into this category 
we believe that the most meaningful presentation of these derivatives is to reflect cash inflows or revenue as net premiums earned  and to record estimates of future cash outflows as incurred losses 
when we determine that a future cash payment is probable  we establish reserves for the loss 
other components of fair value are reflected in other assets or other liabilities in the balance sheet and related changes in fair value reflected in net realized gains losses in the statement of operations 
we generally hold these derivative contracts to maturity 
where we hold a derivative to maturity  the cumulative unrealized gains and losses will net to zero if we incur no losses on that contract 
refer to note c to our consolidated financial statements for a description of this product and related accounting treatment  and ii to mitigate our financial risks  principally arising from our investment holdings  products sold  or assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies 
for these instruments  changes in assets or liabilities measured at fair value are recorded as net realized gains losses 
derivative instruments used for this purpose include interest rate futures  equity futures  options  interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts entered into primarily to manage duration and foreign currency exposure  enhance our portfolio yield or obtain an exposure to a particular financial market 
in addition  as part of our investing activities  we purchase to be announced mortgage backed securities tba  which are derivatives 
the fair value of derivative instruments depends on a number of factors  including changes in interest rates  changes in equity markets  changes in credit markets and  for gmib reinsurance  changes in the allocation of the investments underlying annuitant account value 
where available  we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of these instruments 
if the quoted prices are not available  the fair value is estimated using valuation models for each type of instrument 
internal valuation models include the use of management estimates and current market information 
these models may be developed by third parties or internally based on market conventions for similar transactions  depending on the circumstances 
these models and related assumptions are continuously re evaluated by management and enhanced  as appropriate  based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely market information  such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products  actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements  and the differences may be material 
fair value adjustments attributed to all our derivative transactions are classified and recorded in our net realized gains losses 
with respect to derivatives sold  we recorded a net realized gain of million and million and a net realized loss of million in  and  respectively 
in  and  the net realized gains 
table of contents included nil  million and million for gmib reinsurance  respectively

goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of the cost of our acquisitions over the fair value of net assets we acquired  was billion at december  the ace ina acquisition resulted in approximately percent of this balance 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to a periodic evaluation of impairment 
it is our policy to test goodwill as well as other intangible assets for impairments on an annual basis 
the impairment tests in  in the aggregate  show a fair value in excess of the carrying value 
goodwill is assigned to applicable reporting units of acquired entities at acquisition 
the most significant reporting units are the domestic and international divisions of ace ina  which were acquired in  ace tempest re s catastrophe businesses  acquired in and  and tarquin limited  acquired in there are other reporting units that resulted from smaller acquisitions that are also assessed annually 
in our impairment tests  to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit  we principally use both an earnings model  that considers forecasted earnings and other financial ratios of the reporting unit as well as relevant financial data of comparable companies to the reporting unit such as the relationship of price to earnings for recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies  and an analysis of the present value of estimated net cash flows 
we must assess whether the current fair value of our operating units is at least equal to the fair value used in the determination of goodwill 
in doing this  we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our operating segments  as this is important in assessing whether an impairment has occurred 
if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities change  goodwill could be materially adjusted 
this would cause us to write down the carrying value of goodwill  resulting in a charge to earnings in the period recorded 
accordingly  this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the charge is taken 
risk transfer in the ordinary course of business  we both purchase or cede  and sell or assume  p c reinsurance protection 
in  as a matter of policy  we discontinued the purchase of all finite reinsurance contracts 
for both ceded and assumed reinsurance  risk transfer requirements must be met in order to use reinsurance accounting  principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses 
if risk transfer requirements are not met  a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit  typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense 
to meet risk transfer requirements  a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk  consisting of underwriting and timing risk  and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity 
we also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit 
contracts that include fixed premium ie  premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment 
reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions  such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience  and relatively low policy limits as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits  can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met 
for such contracts  often referred to as finite or structured products  we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception 
to support risk transfer  the cash flow analyses must support the fact that a significant loss is reasonably possible  such as a scenario in which the ratio of the net present value of losses divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds percent 
for purposes of cash flow analyses  we generally use a risk free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments 
in addition  to support insurance risk  we must prove the reinsurer s risk of loss varies with that of the reinsured and or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss 
to ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed  quantitative risk transfer analyses and memoranda supporting risk transfer are developed by underwriters for all structured products 
we have established protocols for structured products that include criteria triggering an accounting review of the contract prior to quoting 
if any criterion is triggered  a contract must be reviewed by a committee established by each of our operating segments with reporting oversight  including peer review  from our global structured transaction review committee 

table of contents with respect to ceded reinsurance  we entered into a few multi year excess of loss retrospectively rated contracts  principally in  some of which remain in force 
these contracts principally provide severity protection for specific product divisions 
because traditional one year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly  these contracts were generally entered into to secure a more cost effective reinsurance program 
all of these contracts transferred risk and have been accounted for as reinsurance 
in addition  we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to  such as the national indemnity company nico contracts referred to in the section entitled  asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities 
subsequent to the ace ina acquisition  we have not purchased any retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts 
with respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts  products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer are primarily sold by our financial solutions business  included in our insurance north american segment 
while there is currently very little new activity for these products  several contracts remain in force and principally include multi year retrospectively rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers 
because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products  relatively few p c insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met 
for certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits  the insured desired to self insure a risk but was required  legally or otherwise  to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non payment from the insured 
a significant portion of ace tempest re usa s business is written through quota share treaties approximately million of net premiums earned in  comprised of million of first dollar quota share treaties and million of excess quota share treaties  some of which are categorized as structured products approximately million of net premiums earned in 
structured quota share treaties typically contain relatively low aggregate policy limits  a feature that reduces loss coverage in some manner and a profit sharing provision 
accounting standard setters for both gaap and statutory reporting have undertaken projects to re evaluate risk transfer guidance  including accounting models that could ultimately require the bifurcation of structured quota share treaties into insurance and financing elements  and perhaps other quota share contracts not currently categorized as structured  into a reinsurance and financing component 
new guidance in this area has the potential to have a significant impact on the amount of premiums and losses recognized under these contracts but we expect little impact to net income 
results of operations years ended december   and the discussions that follow include tables  which show both our consolidated and segment operating results for the three years ended december   and in presenting our segment operating results  we have discussed our performance with reference to underwriting results  which is a non gaap measure 
we consider this measure  which may be defined differently by other companies  to be important in understanding our overall results of operations 
underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses  life and annuity benefits  policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned 
we use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors  including net investment income  other income expense  interest expense  income tax expense and net realized gains losses 
we believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business 
underwriting results should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with gaap

these increases were partially offset by a decline in international financial solutions business 
in addition  ace international had growth on the p c side in continental europe and latin america offset by declines in the uk and asia pacific 
the year ended december  was impacted by net catastrophe related reinstatement premiums  which reduced net premiums written and earned by million 
additionally  the year ended december   included premiums written and earned of million associated with multi year contracts written in our international financial solutions business which did not recur in in general  due to favorable industry financial results and growth in capital which have resulted in increased competition  p c market conditions have deteriorated over the past year  particularly in non catastrophe p c lines 
however  the extent and pace of the deterioration has varied geographically and by line of business 
our global presence and broad product offering have allowed us to continue to be selective and grow lines of business which we believe will produce underwriting income while exiting unprofitable lines 
net premiums written increased three percent in  compared with  primarily due to strong production in ace usa s casualty operations and increased catastrophe related reinstatement premiums  partially offset by a decline in net premiums written at ace global markets 
the following table provides a consolidated breakdown of net premiums earned by line of business for the years ended december   and in millions of us dollars of total of total of total property and all other casualty a h total p c life insurance and reinsurance net premiums earned net premiums earned reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure period expires 
net premiums earned were stable in  compared with as increases in a h percent were offset by significant decreases in financial solutions business  which we include under casualty in the 
table of contents above table 
net premiums earned relating to financial solutions business were million in  compared with million in net premiums earned increased six percent in  compared with primarily due to growth in production of us casualty business  partially offset by the impact of the sale of assured guaranty 
net investment income increased percent in  compared with  and percent in  compared with these increases were primarily due to investment of positive operating cash flows and net proceeds from our approximately billion public offering in october  which have resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base 
in evaluating our p c business  we use the combined ratio  the loss and loss expense ratio  the policy acquisition cost ratio  and the administrative expense ratio 
we calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned 
we do not calculate these ratios for the life business as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that business 
the combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio  the policy acquisition cost ratio  and the administrative expense ratio 
a combined ratio under percent indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio exceeding percent indicates underwriting losses 
the following table shows our consolidated loss and loss expense ratio  policy acquisition ratio  administrative expense ratio and combined ratio for the years ended december   and loss and loss expense ratio policy acquisition cost ratio administrative expense ratio combined ratio our loss and loss expense ratio decreased in  compared with  during which we experienced significant catastrophe losses 
the following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses  a e reserve strengthening and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended december   and loss and loss expense ratio  as reported catastrophe losses a e reserve strengthening prior period development loss and loss expense ratio  adjusted we recorded million in net catastrophe losses in  compared with billion in  and million in in  the catastrophe losses were primarily associated with hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
in  the catastrophe losses were primarily associated with hurricanes which struck the caribbean and the us the results of the recent study conducted in for a e and other run off reserves resulted in activity between a e and other with no increase in net reserves 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded net increases in a e and other run off reserves of million 
prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from previous accident years 
we experienced million in net favorable prior period development in  compared with million of net adverse prior period development in  and million of net adverse prior period development excluding a e reserve strengthening in the favorable prior period development in was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements 
amongst these movements was net adverse development of million on catastrophe losses primarily arising from hurricanes 
we also had reserve releases in other short tail lines 
in the following segment discussions  prior period development unrelated to catastrophes are discussed in more detail 
our policy acquisition costs include commissions  premium taxes  underwriting and other costs that vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of premium 
administrative expenses include all other operating costs 
our policy acquisition costs ratio increased in primarily due to changes in business mix and the favorable impact 
table of contents in of net premiums earned on multi year contracts in connection with the significant catastrophe losses which  generally  did not incur acquisition costs 
our administrative expense ratio increased in  compared with we have invested in global expansion  including staff additions and infrastructure enhancements at ace usa  ace westchester specialty  ace life and ace international 
administrative expenses in also include million related to the settlement with certain governmental agencies from their investigations of various insurance industry practices and million of related legal fees 
the year included million of legal fees related to the investigation 
the decrease in the administrative expense ratio in  compared with  was primarily due to the increased net premiums earned 
additionally  for  administrative expenses were reduced by the release of an accrual in insurance north american and higher net profits from ace usa s esis claims services operation  which we include in administrative expenses 
interest expense was stable in  compared with interest expense decreased in  compared with  primarily due to the million of capital re llc preferred securities which were outstanding in  and redeemed on july  additionally  in  we issued million of percent notes and repaid million of ace ina percent notes 
our effective tax rate is dependent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates  a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate on net income  which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax  was percent in  compared with percent in  and percent in in and  a substantial portion of our catastrophe losses occurred in jurisdictions where we do not incur income tax  causing our income to decline without a commensurate decrease in income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for was approximately five percentage points lower due to the favorable impact of the american jobs creation act  which resulted in an income tax benefit of million 
no such benefit existed in or in  we incurred approximately million in income tax expense related to us federal income taxes from the transfer of our us financial and mortgage guaranty operations to assured guaranty and attributed to the sale of our assured guaranty shares 
additionally  the a e reserve strengthening in resulted in tax benefits of million  which partially reduced our overall effective tax rate on net income for that year 
segment operating results years ended december   and we operate through the following business segments insurance north american  insurance overseas general  global reinsurance and life insurance and reinsurance 
these business segments were determined in accordance with fas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information fas 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we presented a financial services segment 
however  since this segment no longer represents a significant part of our operations  we no longer report it separately 
we classify the financial solutions business of ace financial solutions and ace financial solutions international previously included in the financial services segment with the insurance north american segment 
the financial results of our financial guaranty business through april  the date of the assured guaranty initial public offering and our share of the earnings of assured guaranty  were previously included in the financial services segment and have been classified into our corporate results

increased production was reported in commercial property  including energy and aerospace lines  financial solutions  small and middle market workers compensation  excess liability  and specialty casualty lines of business  including management liability  errors and omissions  medical liability  surety and environmental liability 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in production in the large account risk management unit

the majority of our investment portfolio is available for sale and reported at fair value 
our held to maturity investment portfolio is reported at amortized cost 
the effect of market movements on our available for sale investment portfolio impacts net income through net realized gains losses when securities are sold or when other than temporary impairments are recorded on invested assets 
additionally  net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of derivatives including futures  options  swaps  gmib reinsurance  and credit default swaps 
changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities  which result from the revaluation of securities held  are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
on july   we completed the sale of ace american re  brandywine reinsurance company uk ltd bruk  and brandywine reinsurance company sa nv to randall quilter investment holdings limited r q

the following table presents our pre tax net realized gains losses for the years ended december   and in millions of us dollars fixed maturities and short term investments equity securities foreign currency gains losses other derivatives equity and fixed income derivatives fair value adjustment on insurance derivatives subtotal derivatives total net realized gains losses subject to investment guidelines approved by our finance and investment committee of the board of directors relating to asset classes  credit quality  and liquidity  our investment managers generally have the ability to sell securities from our available for sale investment portfolio when they determine that an alternative security with comparable risks is likely to provide a higher investment return  considering the realized gain or loss on sale of the held security and differential in future investment income 
often  sales of individual securities occur when investment managers conclude there are changes in the credit quality of a particular security or  for other reasons  market value is apt to deteriorate 
further  we may sell securities when we conclude it is prudent to reduce a concentration in a particular issuer or industry 
therefore  sales volume may increase in a volatile credit market in which credit spreads and thus the market value of fixed maturity investments are subject to significant changes in a short period of time 
the interest rate environment will tend to have a limited effect on sales volume but extreme conditions could have an effect on the magnitude of realized gains or losses 
for example  in a declining interest rate environment  the market value of securities increases  resulting in a greater likelihood of net realized gains and we would therefore tend to reduce the average duration of our fixed maturity investment portfolio 
an increasing interest rate environment would tend to have the opposite effect 
the effect of a high level of realized losses or gains for a particular period will tend to be offset by increases or decreases in investment income  respectively  in subsequent periods 
from a liquidity perspective  our greatest risk is that we could be forced to sell a large volume of securities at a loss ie  in a high interest rate environment to meet operating needs and are thus unable to reinvest proceeds to recoup such losses with future investment income refer to liquidity and capital resources for more information 

table of contents in  we recorded net realized losses of million on derivative transactions 
this compares with net realized gains of million and million  in and  respectively 
for a sensitivity discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates and equity indices on the fair value of derivatives and the resulting impact on our net income  refer to item a 
we regularly review our investment portfolio for possible impairment based on criteria including economic conditions  credit loss experience and issuer specific developments 
if there is a decline in a security s net realizable value  we must determine whether that decline is temporary or other than temporary 
if we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary  we record it as an unrealized loss in our shareholders equity 
if we believe the decline is other than temporary  we write down the book value of the investment and record a net realized loss in our statement of operations 
the decision to recognize a decline in the value of a security carried at fair value as other than temporary rather than temporary has no impact on our book value 
once a security is identified as having a potential other than temporary impairment  we determine whether or not cost will ultimately be recovered and whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security until an expected recovery period  absent a significant change in facts that is expected to have a material adverse financial effect on the issuer 
the process of determining whether a decline in value is temporary or other than temporary requires considerable judgment and differs depending on whether or not the security is traded on a public market as well as by type of security 
we review all of our fixed maturities and equity securities for potential impairment each quarter 
refer to note e to the consolidated financial statements for criteria we consider in assessing potential impairment and for a table which summarizes all of our securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and our net realized losses in  included write downs of million  as a result of conditions which caused us to conclude that the decline in fair value was other than temporary 
this compares with write downs of million and million in and  respectively 
the impairments are primarily due to an increase in market interest rates from the date of security purchase and as such  are not credit related

table of contents in accordance with our investment process  we invest in below investment grade securities through dedicated investment portfolios managed by external investment managers that have investment professionals specifically dedicated to this asset class 
at december   our fixed income investment portfolio included below investment grade and non rated securities which  in total  comprised approximately seven percent of our fixed income portfolio 
we define a security as being below investment grade if it has an s p credit rating of bb or less 
our below investment grade and non rated portfolio includes approximately issues  with the top holdings making up approximately percent of the billion balance at december  the highest single exposure in this portfolio of securities is million 
below investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities 
risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below investment grade securities 
below investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer 
also  issuers of below investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  such as recession or increasing interest rates  than are investment grade issuers 
we reduce the overall risk in the below investment grade portfolio  as in all investments  through careful credit analysis  strict investment policy guidelines and diversification by issuer and or guarantor as well as by industry 
restricted assets we are required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support our insurance and reinsurance operations 
these requirements are generally promulgated in the statutory regulations of the individual jurisdictions 
the assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities 
we also utilize trust funds in certain large transactions where the trust funds are set up for the benefit of the ceding companies and generally take the place of letter of credit loc requirements 
we also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for locs and debt instruments 
refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements the following table identifies the value of restricted assets at december  and in millions of us dollars deposits with us regulatory authorities deposits with non us regulatory authorities assets used for collateral or guarantees trust funds the value of restricted assets increased seven percent in compared with  primarily due to increased use of trust funds in support of us business ceded by ace tempest re usa to ace tempest re bermuda 
asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are amounts for a e 
these a e liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites 
the estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal  social and economic environment 
we have not assumed any such future changes in setting the value of our a e reserves  which include provisions for both reported and ibnr claims 
our exposure to a e claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased westchester specialty in and the p c business of cigna in  with the larger exposure contained within the liabilities acquired in the cigna transaction 
in  prior to our acquisition of the p c business of cigna  the pennsylvania insurance commissioner approved a plan to restructure ina financial corporation and its subsidiaries the restructuring which included the division of insurance company of north america ina into two separate corporations an active insurance company that retained the ina name and continued to write p c business and an inactive run off company  now called century indemnity company century 
as a result of the division  predominantly all a e and certain other liabilities of ina were allocated to century and extinguished  as a matter of pennsylvania law  as liabilities of ina 
as part of the restructuring  the a e liabilities of various us affiliates of ina were reinsured to century  and century and certain other run off companies having a e and other liabilities were contributed to

the net figures in the above table reflect third party reinsurance other than reinsurance provided by nico under three aggregate excess of loss contracts described below collectively  the nico contracts 
we exclude the nico contracts as they cover non a e liabilities as well as a e liabilities 
the split of coverage provided under the nico contracts for a e liabilities as compared to non a e liabilities is entirely dependant on the speed at which the related claims will be paid 
our ability to make an estimate of this split is not practicable 
we believe  instead  that the a e discussion is best provided excluding the nico contracts  while separately discussing the nico contracts in relation to the total subject business  both a e and non a e  covered by those contracts 
with certain exceptions  the nico contracts provide coverage for our net a e incurred losses and allocated loss expenses within the limits of coverage and above ace s retention levels 
these exceptions include losses arising from operations of ace overseas general and participations by ace bermuda as a co reinsurer or retrocessionaire in the nico contracts 
the adverse gross asbestos incurred activity was primarily due to some deterioration in asbestos exposures driven by an increase in legal defense expenses and adverse development on select accounts  brought on by isolated circumstances specific to those accounts 
despite the adverse gross asbestos incurred activity  net incurred activity declined in this was partially due to improvements in our recoverable estimation process  favorable actual paid net to gross trends since the prior review and changes in the mix of gross losses subject to reinsurance recoveries 
since our last a e reserve study  we have improved our highly detailed and quantitative approach to modeling the cessions to our third party facultative and treaty reinsurance for each modeled account 
we allocate each modeled ground up account estimate to the applicable direct brandywine policies and then apply the terms of each applicable facultative certificate and treaty program to determine the percentage ceded and the reinsurance ceded by reinsurer 
this process allows us to specifically determine credit quality and hence the appropriate provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
for this study  we applied the reinsurance model to over percent of accounts  compared to percent for the previous study 
with respect to change in exposure mix  our overall gross incurred loss and loss expense comprises favorable and adverse development in the underlying component lines of business and exposures 
we experienced adverse development with respect to gross losses for lines with significant third party reinsurance eg asbestos  excess liability and favorable development of gross losses in less heavily reinsured lines 
hence  the impact of the adverse gross development was reduced by reinsurance recoveries while at the same time less of the favorable development was ceded to reinsurers and retained

reserve reviews during  we conducted an internal  ground up review of our consolidated a e liabilities as of june  during the same period  a team of external actuaries performed an evaluation as to the adequacy of the reserves of century 
this external review was conducted in accordance with the brandywine restructuring order  which requires that an external actuarial review of century s reserves be completed every two years 
in addition  we engaged the external actuaries to review the a e reserves of ace american re 
as a result of the internal review  we concluded that our net loss reserves for the brandywine operations  including a e  were adequate and  therefore  no change to the carried net reserve was required  while the gross loss reserves increased by approximately million 
the conclusions of the external review provided estimates of ultimate gross and net brandywine liabilities that are lower than a comparable study in as a result  the difference in net loss reserves between the internal and external studies has narrowed to approximately million million after tax from million million after tax in our a e reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated future changes in the legal  social or economic environment  or any benefit from future legislative reforms

reserving considerations for asbestos  we face claims relating to policies issued to manufacturers  distributors  installers and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos 
claims can be filed by individual claimants or group of claimants with the potential for hundreds of individual claimants at one time 
claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies for a single insured 
our definition of an asbestos claim count is a policyholder asbestos cause of action  with claims for bodily injury and property damage tracked separately 
for example  an asbestos manufacturer who faces products liability claims alleging bodily injury from exposure to their product would generate one count regardless of the number of policies we may have issued or the actual numbers of underlying claimants alleging bodily injury damages 
environmental claims present exposure for remediation and defense costs associated with the contamination of property as a result of pollution 
it is common  especially for larger defendants  to be named as a potentially responsible party prp at multiple sites 
our environmental claim count definition is based on policyholder by site numbers 
for example  if a policyholder were named as a prp at ten pollution sites  we would track this as ten claim counts 
in addition  should we have multiple policyholders identified as prp s at the same waste site  each would constitute a separate claim count 
the table below summarizes count information for asbestos and environmental claims for the years ended december  and  for direct policies only  and excludes claims from assumed reinsurance 
asbestos by causative agent open at the beginning of year newly reported closed or otherwise disposed open at end of year environmental by site open at the beginning of year newly reported closed or otherwise disposed open at end of year in  the number of newly reported asbestos claims declined percent to  compared with new claims in the total pending asbestos claims increased three percent to  at december   compared with  at december  this increase in pending claims is influenced by the number of closings during the period 
given the nature of asbestos claim files  it is not unusual for a file to remain open for a period of time after the financial activity on the file has ended and a minimal increase in pending claims should not be taken as an adverse indication of underlying trends 
in  the number of newly reported environmental claims continued the decline experienced in recent years 
the number of new sites in declined percent to  compared with in total pending environmental claims at december  declined seven percent to  compared with  at december  
table of contents the following table shows our gross and net survival ratios for our a e loss reserves and allocated loss adjustment expense alae reserves at december  year survival ratios year survival ratios gross net gross net asbestos environmental total the net ratios reflect third party reinsurance other than the aggregate excess reinsurance provided under the nico contracts 
these survival ratios are calculated by dividing the asbestos or environmental loss and alae reserves by the average asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments for the three most recent calendar years year survival ratio  and by asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments in year survival ratio 
the survival ratios provide only a very rough measure of reserve adequacy and are significantly impacted by a number of factors such as aggressive settlement practices  variations in gross to ceded relationships within the asbestos or environmental claims and levels of coverage provided 
we therefore urge caution in using these very simplistic ratios to gauge reserve adequacy and note that the year survival ratios  particularly  are likely to move considerably from year to year for the reasons just described 
our survival ratios decreased in  compared with in  the net year survival ratio for asbestos was  compared with in  and was heavily impacted by a single large cession of paid losses  which resulted in an atypically high net survival ratio 
additionally  in  we had a favorable settlement that resulted in a full buyback of policy obligations on a significant account that resulted in a large increase in payments for the year and  therefore  had an unfavorable impact on our asbestos survival ratios 
brandywine run off entities in addition to housing a significant portion of our a e exposure  the brandywine operations include run off liabilities related to various insurance and reinsurance businesses 
the following companies comprise ace s brandywine operations century a pennsylvania insurer  century re a pennsylvania insurer and century international reinsurance company ltd 
a bermuda insurer circ 
all of the brandywine companies are direct or indirect subsidiaries of brandywine holdings 
the us based ace ina companies assumed two contractual obligations in respect of the brandywine operations in connection with the restructuring a dividend retention fund obligation and a surplus maintenance obligation in the form of an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement 
in accordance with the brandywine restructuring order  ina financial corporation established and funded a dividend retention fund the dividend retention fund consisting of million plus investment earnings 
the full balance of the dividend retention fund was contributed to century as of december  to the extent future dividends are paid by ina holdings corporation to its parent  ina financial corporation  and to the extent ina financial corporation then pays such dividends to ina corporation  a portion of those dividends must be withheld to replenish the principal of the dividend retention fund to million within five years 
in  and  no such dividends were paid and  therefore  no replenishment of the dividend retention fund occurred 
the obligation to maintain and to replenish the dividend retention fund as necessary and to the extent dividends are paid is ongoing until ace ina receives prior written approval from the pennsylvania insurance commissioner to terminate the fund 
in addition  the ace ina insurance subsidiaries provided insurance coverage to century in the amount of million under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement the aggregate excess of loss agreement if the statutory capital and surplus of century falls below million or if century lacks liquid assets with which to pay claims as they become due  after giving effect to the contribution of the balance  if any  of the dividend retention fund 
coverage under the aggregate excess of loss agreement was triggered as of december  following contribution of the balance of the dividend retention fund  because century s capital and surplus fell below million at december  effective december   ace ina holdings contributed million to century in exchange for a surplus note 
after giving effect to the contribution and issuance of the surplus note  the statutory surplus of century at december  was million and approximately million in statutory basis losses were ceded to the aggregate excess of loss agreement 
century reports the amount ceded under the aggregate excess of loss agreement in accordance with statutory accounting principles  which differ from gaap by  among other things  allowing century 
table of contents to discount its asbestos and environmental reserves 
for gaap reporting purposes  intercompany reinsurance recoverables related to the aggregate excess of loss agreement are eliminated upon consolidation 
to estimate ace s remaining claim exposure under the aggregate excess of loss agreement under gaap  we adjust the statutory cession to exclude the discount embedded in statutory loss reserves 
at december   approximately million in gaap basis losses were ceded under the aggregate excess of loss agreement  leaving a remaining limit of coverage under that agreement of approximately million 
at december   the remaining limit of coverage under the agreement was million 
the increase in the remaining limit in was primarily related to the sale of the run off reinsurance subsidiaries 
while we believe ace has no legal obligation to fund losses above the aggregate excess of loss agreement limit of coverage  ace s consolidated results would nevertheless continue to report any losses above the limit of coverage for so long as the brandywine companies remain consolidated subsidiaries of ace 
uncertainties relating to ace s ultimate brandywine exposure in addition to the dividend retention fund and aggregate excess of loss agreement commitments described above  certain ace entities are primarily liable for asbestos  environmental and other exposures that they have reinsured to century 
accordingly  if century were to become insolvent and ace were to lose control of century  some or all of the recoverables due to these ace companies from century could become uncollectible  yet those ace entities would continue to be responsible to pay claims to their insureds or reinsureds 
under such circumstances  ace would recognize a loss in its consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the aggregate reinsurance balances ceded by the active ace companies to century were approximately billion 
at december   century s carried gross reserves including reserves ceded by the active ace companies to century were billion 
we believe the intercompany reinsurance recoverables  which relate to liabilities payable over many years ie  years or more  are not impaired at this time 
a substantial portion of the liabilities ceded to century by its affiliates have in turn been ceded by century to nico and  as of december   approximately billion of cover remains on a paid basis 
should century s loss reserves experience adverse development in the future and should century be placed into rehabilitation or liquidation  the reinsurance recoverables due to century s affiliates would be payable only after the payment in full of certain expenses and liabilities  including administrative expenses and direct policy liabilities 
thus  the intercompany reinsurance recoverables would be at risk to the extent of the shortage of assets remaining to pay these recoverables 
as of december   reserves ceded by century to the active ace companies and other amounts owed to century by the active ace companies were approximately million in the aggregate 
in a lawsuit filed in california state court in december aicco  inc v 
insurance company of north america  et al  certain competitors of ace usa challenged the validity of the restructuring under california s unfair competition law  business and professions code section ucl 
the lawsuit claims that the restructuring is not applicable to california policyholders under the ucl because it constituted a transfer of liabilities without the consent of the policyholders 
the suit also claims that the notice of the restructuring was misleading 
in november  the voters of california approved proposition amending the ucl by  among other things  requiring that lawsuits brought under the ucl be brought by plaintiffs who have suffered actual injury as a result of the challenged business practice 
in response to a motion to dismiss brought by ace usa  the court ruled in february that the competitors plaintiffs who brought this suit have not alleged actual injury as required by proposition and dismissed the suit 
plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal on may  oral argument over plaintiffs appeal was held on april  on may   the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of aicco s lawsuit 
aicco filed a petition to appeal to the california supreme court  however  the california supreme court accepted review of another unrelated case that will ultimately decide the issue of whether proposition should be applied retroactively and which will be binding on this case 
on july   the california supreme court announced its decision in californians for disability rights v mervyn s et al  ruling that proposition applies to pending cases 
the supreme court has entered an order denying leave to appeal and this case is concluded

catastrophe exposure management we have exposure to catastrophic event risks from global insurance and reinsurance writings of property and workers compensation and  to a lesser extent  marine  aviation and energy 
this potential loss accumulation  caused by either man made for example  terrorism  aviation or natural perils for example  hurricane  earthquake is addressed using 
table of contents several different approaches 
first  we have established a series of product boards to ensure that geographic  product and client exposures are appropriate and meet both account level and portfolio limit guidelines adopted by the product boards 
second  we have a standardized modeling approach across our organization that utilizes a third party catastrophe simulation software package as the basis for preparing probabilistic estimates of our potential catastrophic loss 
each unit with catastrophe exposure is required to model  price and manage its catastrophe risk using the output analytics from the software and this output also allows the aggregation of risk within and across business units 
we continually examine the reasonableness of the modeling assumptions and their applicability to reflect the catastrophic loss potential of our various businesses 
in addition  we maintain minimum data quality standards that must be met in order to quote and bind business 
the aggregation of risk across units  products  perils and geography is performed across our organization on a quarterly basis to provide an overall assessment of risk and the results reviewed by senior management each quarter 
management maintains a prudent level of risk through a series of related accumulation thresholds that cap the net retention from single or multiple events  the probability of exhaustion of core catastrophe reinsurance programs  and the net catastrophe loss relative to tangible capital shareholders equity less goodwill 
third  where the risk return economics are compelling  reinsurance is purchased from reinsurers of appropriate quality and security to protect the business unit level from accumulations arising either within product  peril or business unit or across a combination thereof such that the aggregate risk from a catastrophe loss is appropriate to the unit s capital structure 
despite the above controls  there remains uncertainty about the characteristics  timing and extent of insured loss given the nature of catastrophes 
natural catastrophe reinsurance program ace s core catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary operations ie excluding assumed reinsurance and consists of two separate towers 
first  for losses arising out of north america  our core traditional program renewed on january   and we purchased million part of million excess of million in coverage and we purchased million part of million excess of million in coverage 
the combined effect of our traditional program purchase is that we have percent of million excess of million in coverage placed and we have approximately percent of the million excess million layer placed 
each of these layers has a single reinstatement 
in addition  we have purchased multi year  peril specific coverage from a major reinsurer that is backed by their credit worthiness and the issuance of fully collateralized catastrophe bonds 
under this multi year coverage  we have million of us hurricane coverage in excess of million retention 
in addition  we have purchased us earthquake coverage for california  pacific northwest  and central us this cover is percent of million of loss incurred in excess of a million retention 
finally  we also purchased a combined us earthquake as defined above and us hurricane top layer cover of percent of million of loss incurred in excess of a million retention 
these multiyear programs do not have a reinstatement feature 
the company also entered into a swap agreement whereby the company received million of us earthquake california  and pacific northwest protection in exchange for providing its counterparty with protection for northeast us hurricane exposure 
payments for each side of the swap would be triggered if  following a catastrophic event from a covered region and peril  the counter party and industry insured losses reach levels as specified in the swap contract 
by way of comparison  the program has approximately million more in coverage for us hurricane and million more in coverage for california earthquake than the expiring program 
the actual retention for will depend upon the nature of the loss and the interplay between the underlying per risk programs and certain other coverages purchased by individual business units 
second  for losses arising outside of north america and effective july   we have protection of percent of million from a single catastrophic event in excess of the retention of million with two reinstatements 
there is further protection above this core program  ie  million excess of million for asia pacific and million excess of million for europe 
in addition  there are various underlying per risk and catastrophe treaties underlying the core program s retention of million 
the program has essentially the same terms as expiring but with the addition of the europe specific layer 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short term and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
as a holding company  ace possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries  and of other investments 
in addition to net investment income  our cash flows currently depend primarily on dividends or other statutorily permissible payments 
historically  these dividends and other payments have come from ace s bermuda based operating subsidiaries  which we refer to as our bermuda subsidiaries 
as an insurance company  one of our principal responsibilities to our clients is to ensure that we have ready access to funds to settle large unforeseen claims 
given anticipated growth in premiums and a lengthening of the average duration of our claim liabilities due to a higher proportionate growth in long tail relative to short tail business  we expect that positive cash flow from operations underwriting activities and investment income will be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios through to further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims  we hold a certain amount of invested assets in cash and short term investments and maintain available credit facilities refer to the section entitled credit facilities below 
in addition  for certain insurance  reinsurance  or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows  such as loss portfolio contracts  we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration matched with the related liabilities 
with respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio  we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments 
in a low interest rate environment  the overall duration of our fixed maturity investments tends to be shorter and in a high interest rate environment  such durations tend to be longer 
given the current low rate environment  at december   the average duration of our fixed maturity investments years is less than the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities years 
despite our safeguards  if paid losses accelerated beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows  we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing 
potential events causing such a liquidity strain could include several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time or large scale uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses as a result of coverage disputes  reinsurers credit problems or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables 
additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund loss payments were sold at depressed prices 
because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the ace group of companies  the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level 
as a result  the probability of a liquidity strain  as described above  may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis 
if such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary  we could liquidate a portion of the portfolio as well as be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations 
the payments of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction  as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations  including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies  which are discussed below 
during  we were able to meet all of our obligations  including the payment of dividends declared on our ordinary shares and preferred shares  with our net cash flow and dividends received 
should the need arise  we generally have access to the capital markets and other available credit facilities 
we assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors 
considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary s financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision 
the legal restrictions on the payment of dividends from retained earnings by our bermuda subsidiaries are currently satisfied by the share capital and additional paid in capital of each of the bermuda subsidiaries 
in  ace bermuda declared and paid dividends of million and ace tempest life reinsurance declared and paid dividends of million 
during  ace bermuda and ace tempest life reinsurance declared and paid dividends of million and million  respectively 
we expect that a majority of our cash inflows in will be from our bermuda subsidiaries 
the payment of any dividends from ace global markets or its subsidiaries is subject to applicable uk insurance laws and regulations 
in addition  the release of funds by syndicate to subsidiaries of ace global markets is subject to regulations promulgated by the society of lloyd s 
ace ina s us insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends  without prior regulatory approval  subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary s domicile or  if applicable  commercial domicile 
typically  restrictions state that dividends may only be paid from earned surplus 
table of contents unassigned funds and are subject to i certain limitations based upon the policyholder surplus and or net income or investment income of the insurer specific threshold set by state law of insurer s domicile  ii total dividends paid during a twelve month period  and iii the maintenance of minimum capital requirements 
ace ina s international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate 
these laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities 
ace did not receive any dividends from ace global markets or ace ina in and the debt issued by ace ina to provide partial financing for the ace ina acquisition and for other operating needs is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by ace ina s insurance subsidiaries to ace ina as well as other group resources 
our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written  net investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
funds are used primarily to pay claims  operating expenses  dividends  debt service and for the purchase of investments 
after satisfying our cash requirements  excess cash flows from these underwriting and investing activities are invested 
our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance  sometimes substantially in advance  of the time claims are paid 
generally  cash flows are affected by claim payments that  due to the nature of our operations  may be comprised of large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods 
refer to contractual obligations and commitments for our estimate for future claim payments by period 
sources of liquidity include cash from operations  routine sales of investments and financing arrangements 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and our consolidated net cash flows from operating activities were billion in  compared with billion in these amounts reflect net income for each period  adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital 
net income increased to billion in  compared with billion in for  significant adjustments included increases in unpaid losses and loss expenses and unearned premiums of billion and a decrease in reinsurance recoverable of million due to growth in casualty and a h lines 
net cash flows from operating activities were negatively impacted by increased catastrophe loss payments in and our consolidated net cash flows used for investing activities were billion in  compared with billion in for the indicated periods  net cash flows used for investing activities were related principally to net purchases of fixed maturities 
the year included the impact of the sale of the run off companies which reduced cash and investments by approximately million 
in  net cash flows used for investing activities benefited from the net proceeds of the public offering of approximately billion 
our consolidated net cash flows used for financing activities were million in  compared with consolidated net cash flows from financing activities of billion in net cash flows used for financing activities in were primarily comprised of dividends paid on ordinary shares  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of options for ordinary shares 
in  cash flows from financing activities were primarily comprised of the net proceeds of the public offering  partially offset by dividends paid on ordinary shares 
both internal and external forces influence our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
claim settlements  premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions 
in many cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the liability for that loss 
we believe that our cash balances  cash flow from operations  routine sales of investments and the liquidity provided by our credit facilities  as discussed below  are adequate to meet expected cash requirements 
in order to enhance cash management efficiency  during  we entered into agreements with a bank provider to implement an international multi currency notional cash pooling program and a us multi currency notional cash pooling program 
in each program  participating ace entities based on regulatory approval establish deposit accounts in different currencies with the bank provider and  each day  the credit or debit balances in every account are notionally translated into a single currency us dollars and then notionally pooled 
the bank extends overdraft credit to any participating ace entity as needed  provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in each pool at the end of each day is at least zero 
actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not co mingled between legal entities 
this arrangement is particularly effective during periods of short term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency 
ace entities may incur overdraft balances as a means to address such mismatches  and any overdraft balances incurred under this program by an ace entity would be guaran 
table of contents teed by ace limited up to million in the aggregate 
ace limited has negotiated a dedicated credit facility to support both programs 
ace limited and its subsidiaries are assigned debt and financial strength insurance ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies  including s p  am best  moody s investors service and fitch 
the ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies 
our internet site  www 
acelimited 
com  also contains some information about our ratings  which can be found under the investor information tab 
financial strength ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies on the financial strength of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of insurance policies 
independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets 
the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company  including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company 
these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities 
debt ratings apply to short term and long term debt as well as preferred stock 
these ratings are assessments of the likelihood that we will make timely payments of principal  interest and preferred stock dividends 
it is possible that  in the future  one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings 
if one or more of our ratings were downgraded  we could incur higher borrowing costs  and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted 
in addition  our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
capital resources capital resources consist of funds deployed  or available to be deployed  to support our business operations 
the following table summarizes the components of our capital resources at december  and in millions of us dollars december december short term debt long term debt total debt trust preferred securities preferred shares ordinary shareholders equity total shareholders equity total capitalization ratio of debt to total capitalization ratio of debt plus trust preferred securities to total capitalization we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short term and long term basis 
our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on  among other things  market conditions and our perceived financial strength 
we have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time 
short term debt we have commercial paper programs that use revolving credit facilities as back up facilities and provide for up to million in commercial paper issuance for each of ace limited and ace ina holdings  inc subject to the availability of back up facilities  which currently total million 
at december   there was no commercial paper outstanding 
short term debt consisted of million of percent senior notes due april and a million percent term loan due december

the following instruments have specific collateral triggers 
in  ace us holdings issued million of unsecured senior notes that mature in october in december  ace ina issued million of unsecured subordinated notes that mature in december  we repaid million of this outstanding amount during we have a million credit default swap in place that has the economic effect of reducing our cost of borrowing associated with these two issuances 
the minimum collateral in connection with the credit default swap is million 
the actual collateral can be higher depending on the credit quality of securities pledged 
under these transactions  we would be required to provide collateral of million if s p downgraded our debt rating to bb or lower or downgraded ace bermuda s financial strength rating to bbb or lower 
although there can be no assurance  we believe it is unlikely that either of these two events will occur 
in the event that we terminate either of the swaps prematurely  we would be liable for certain transaction costs 
the counter party in each swap is a highly rated major financial institution and management does not anticipate non performance 
trust preferred securities during and  we issued million of trust preferred securities

we have guaranteed the payments on these debt instruments 
the trustees of the trust include one or more of our officers and at least one independent trustee  such as a trust company 
our officers serving as trustees of the trust do not receive any compensation or other remuneration for their services in such capacity

additional information with respect to the trust preferred securities is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
ordinary shares total shareholders equity increased billion in  primarily due to net income of billion and unrealized appreciation on our investment portfolio  partially offset by dividends declared 
our ratios of debt to total capitalization and debt plus trust preferred securities to total capitalization have decreased due to the increase in shareholders equity and stable debt and trust preferred securities 
in october  we completed a public offering of million ordinary shares for total gross proceeds of approximately billion 
as part of our capital management program  in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of any ace issued debt or capital securities including ordinary shares  up to million

we have no other significant contractual obligations or commitments not reflected in the table above 
deposit liabilities deposit liabilities include reinsurance deposit liabilities of million and million and contract holder deposit funds of million and million for and  respectively 
the reinsurance deposit liabilities arise from contracts we sold for which there is not a significant transfer of risk 
at contract inception  the deposit liability is equal to net cash we received 
an accretion rate is established based on actuarial estimates whereby the deposit liability is increased to the estimated amount payable over the term of the contract 
the deposit accretion rate is the rate of return required to fund expected future payment obligations 
we periodically reassess the estimated ultimate liability and related expected rate of return 
any resulting changes to the amount of the deposit liability are reflected as an adjustment to earnings to reflect the cumulative effect of the period the contract has been in force  and by an adjustment to the future accretion rate of the liability over the remaining estimated contract term 
additional information with respect to deposit liabilities is contained in note j to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents purchase obligations we are party to enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase certain services 
purchase obligations in the table primarily comprise audit fees and agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services 
limited partnerships funding commitments in connection with our investments in limited partnerships  we have commitments that may require funding of up to million over the next several years 
the timing of the payment of these commitments is uncertain and will differ from our estimated timing in the table 
operating lease commitments we lease office space in most countries in which we operate under operating leases that expire at various dates through december we renew and enter into new leases in the ordinary course of business as required 
estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts we are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts 
such loss payments represent our most significant future payment obligation as a p c insurance and reinsurance company 
in contrast to other contractual obligations  cash payments are not determinable from the terms specified within the contract 
for example  we do not ultimately make a payment to our counterparty for many insurance and reinsurance contracts ie  when a loss event has not occurred and if a payment is to be made  the amount and timing cannot be determined from the contract 
in the table above  we estimate payments by period relating to our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses included in the consolidated balance sheet at december  and do not take reinsurance recoverables into account 
these estimated loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material 
given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of loss and loss expense reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future loss and loss expense payments in the table above  differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates 
estimated payments for future life and annuity policy benefits we establish reserves for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts including  but not limited to  guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdbs and gmibs 
the amounts in the table are gross of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts 
the liability for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet is discounted and  with respect to gmib reinsurance  reflected net of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts  and with respect to gmdb reinsurance  does not consider benefit payments related to future fees or premiums not recognized through the balance sheet date 
accordingly  the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet 
payment amounts related to these reserves must be estimated and are not determinable from the contract 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of these payments  actual results could materially differ from the estimates in the table 
credit facilities as our bermuda subsidiaries are not admitted insurers and reinsurers in the us  the terms of certain us insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide locs to clients 
in addition  ace global markets is required to satisfy certain us regulatory trust fund requirements which can be met by the issuance of locs

for the purpose of this calculation  the minimum amount is an amount equal to the sum of the base amount currently billion plus percent of consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter  ending after the date on which the current base amount became effective  plus percent of any increase in consolidated net worth during the same period  attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares 
the minimum amount is subject to an annual reset provision  and ii maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than to under this covenant  debt does not include trust preferred securities or mezzanine equity  except where the ratio of the sum of trust preferred securities and mezzanine equity to total capitalization is greater than percent 
in this circumstance  the amount greater than percent would be included in the debt to total capitalization ratio 
at december   a the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in i above was billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was billion and b our ratio of debt to total capitalization was to in addition to these covenants  the ace global markets capital facility requires that collateral be posted if the financial strength rating of ace falls to s p bbb or lower 
our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would  subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants  result in an event of default 
this could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize locs under such facility 
a failure by ace limited or any of its subsidiaries to pay an obligation due for an amount exceeding million would result in an event of default under all of the facilities described above

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
we are exposed to potential losses from various market risks including changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
further  through the writings of certain products such as credit derivatives through our approximately percent ownership of assured guaranty and gmib and gmdb products  we are exposed to deterioration in the credit markets  decreases in interest rates and declines in the equity markets 
our investment portfolio consists of both fixed income and equity securities  denominated in both us dollars and foreign currencies  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our fixed income and all of our equity securities are classified as available for sale and  as such  changes in interest rates  equity prices or foreign currency exchange rates will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income 
nevertheless  changes in interest rates and equity prices affect consolidated net income when  and if  a security is sold or impaired 
from time to time  we also use investment derivative instruments such as futures  options  interest rate swaps  and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of our investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market 
in addition  as part of our investing activity  we purchase tbas 
these instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security prices 
changes in the fair value of tbas are included in net realized gains losses and therefore have an immediate effect on both our net income and shareholders equity 
at december  and  our notional exposure to investment derivative instruments was billion and billion  respectively 
we seek to mitigate market risk using a number of techniques  including maintaining and managing the assets and liabilities of our international operations consistent with the foreign currencies of the underlying insurance and reinsurance businesses  thereby limiting exchange rate risk to net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
also  from time to time  we enter into derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing certain investment portfolio exposures 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures at december  our policies to address these risks in were not materially different from we do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk is primarily concentrated in our fixed income portfolio  our debt obligations and  to a lesser extent  our gmib reinsurance business 
changes in investment values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our insurance reserves and debt obligations 
we monitor this exposure through periodic reviews of our asset and liability positions 
the following table shows the impact on the market value of our fixed income portfolio of an increase in interest rates of basis points applied instantly across the yield curve an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario at december  and in millions of us dollars december december fair value of fixed income portfolio pre tax impact of basis point increase in interest rates percentage of total fixed income portfolio at fair value changes in interest rates will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income 
although our debt  preferred shares  and trust preferred securities collectively referred to as debt obligations are reported at amortized value and not adjusted for fair value changes  changes in interest rates could have a material impact on their fair value  albeit there is no immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the 
table of contents following table shows the impact on the market value of our debt obligations of a decrease in interest rates of basis points applied instantly across the yield curve an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario at december  and in millions of us dollars december december fair value of debt obligations impact of basis point decrease in interest rates percentage of total debt obligations at fair value variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of prepayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results could differ from those reflected in the tables 
our net income is directly impacted by changes in the fair value of gmibs 
net realized gains of nil and million were reported for gmib reinsurance in and  respectively 
the change in the fair value of gmibs is determined using internal valuation models 
such valuations require considerable judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
the valuation of these products is subject to fluctuations arising from  among other factors  changes in interest rates  changes in the equity markets and changes in the allocation of the investments underlying annuitant s account value 
these models and the related assumptions are continually reviewed by management and enhanced  as appropriate  based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely information  such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities 
including the effect of hedge derivatives  we estimate that based on in force annuities covered by gmib reinsurance treaties at december   a downward parallel shift of the yield curve of basis points would result in an unrealized loss of approximately million 
this estimated change in fair value would be recorded as net realized losses in our net income 
the gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims 
equity price risk our portfolio of equity securities  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  has exposure to price risk 
this risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
in addition  we attain exposure to the equity markets through the use of derivative instruments  which also have exposure to price risk 
our us equity portfolio is correlated with the s p index and changes in that index would approximate the impact on our portfolio 
our international equity portfolio has exposure to a broad range of non us equity markets 
the following table provides more information on our exposure to equity price risk at december  and millions of us dollars december december fair value of equity securities pre tax impact of percent decline in market prices for equity exposures changes in the fair value of our equity portfolio are recorded as unrealized appreciation depreciation and are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
as discussed above  our net income is directly impacted by changes in the fair value of gmibs 
including the effect of hedge derivatives  we estimate that based on in force annuities covered by gmib reinsurance treaties at december   a percent decline in the s p index would result in an unrealized loss of approximately million 
this estimated change in fair value would be recorded as net realized losses in our consolidated statement of operations 
the gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk many of our non us companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies 
therefore  foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies 
foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process 
locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the british pound sterling  the euro dollar and the canadian dollar
