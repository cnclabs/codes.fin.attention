item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview drc  founded in and headquartered in andover  massachusetts  provides it  engineering and other services focused on national defense and intelligence  public safety and citizen services for government customers 
the government market is composed of three sectors national defense and intelligence  federal civilian agencies  and state and local governments 
our core capabilities are focused on it  engineering and technical subject matter expertise that pertain to the knowledge domains of our core customers 
recent industry reports  such as the federal it market forecast published by input  are projecting long term growth rates in demand by the federal government for professional services of approximately 
these estimates are  in general  lower than those made a year ago 
we are cognizant of funding challenges facing the federal government and the resulting increase in competitiveness in our industry 
significant contract awards have been and will continue to be delayed and new initiatives have been slow to start 
there appears to be recent improvement in contract award and funding decisions with the passage of federal budgets for fiscal year for the dod and dhs 
however  contract award and funding decisions for the federal civilian agencies have been delayed  as these departments are currently operating under a continuing resolution for fiscal year customers are moving away from gsa and time and materials contracts toward agency sponsored id iq contract vehicles and fixed price contracts and task orders 
the dod seeks to reduce spending on contracted program advisory and assistance services and often is setting this work aside for small businesses 
concurrently  there is increasing demand from federal customers for engineering  training  business transformation  lean six sigma and business intelligence solutions and services 
many federal customers are seeking to streamline their procurement activities by consolidating work under large contract vehicles 
our competitive strategy is intended to align with these trends 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with that transition method  we have not restated prior periods for the effect of compensation expense calculated under sfas r 
we have continued to use the black scholes pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of all applicable awards 
compensation expense for all share based equity awards is being recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the adoption of sfas r had a pre tax impact of million in  net of a cumulative effect of accounting change of million recorded during the first quarter of during  total share based compensation was million  compared to million in which only included share based compensation for restricted stock awards 
as of december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years  and the total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards was million  which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
total revenue in was million  a decrease of over the decrease was a due to the curtailment of work and the loss of certain contracts 
our gross margin was of total revenue in  compared to of total revenue in the decline in the gross margin was primarily a result of an increase in indirect costs including severance costs related to a reduction in workforce  an increase in business development efforts  increased share based compensation costs  higher provisions for the valuation of our unbilled expenditures and fees on contracts in process and a change in revenue mix 
our operating margin was of total revenue in  compared to of total revenue in the decline in the operating margin was primarily due to indirect overhead costs  employee benefit costs and general and administrative expenses decreasing at a slower rate than revenues 
during the second quarter of  we implemented a cost reduction plan to bring indirect spending back in line with revenue projections for as a result  operating margins improved in the second half of 
table of contents we have two reportable business segments systems and services  and metrigraphics 
the systems and services segment accounted for of total revenue and the metrigraphics segment accounted for of total revenue in critical accounting policies there are business risks specific to the industries in which we operate 
these risks include  but are not limited to estimates of costs to complete contract obligations  changes in government policies and procedures  government contracting issues and risks associated with technological development 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions and changes in business strategy or market conditions may significantly impact our assets or liabilities  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments made and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our systems and services business segment provides services pursuant to time and materials  cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts  including service type contracts 
for time and materials contracts  revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate  as well as reimbursement of other billable direct costs 
the risk inherent in time and materials contracts is that actual costs may differ materially from negotiated billing rates in the contract  which would directly affect operating income 
for cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized as costs are incurred and includes a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
cost reimbursable contracts specify the contract fee in dollars or as a percentage of estimated costs 
the primary risk on a cost reimbursable contract is that a government audit of direct and indirect costs could result in the disallowance of certain costs  which would directly impact revenue and margin on the contract 
historically  such audits have not had a material impact on our revenue and operating income 
revenue from service type fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate output methods to measure service provided  and contract costs are expensed as incurred 
under fixed price contracts  other than service type contracts  revenue is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the risk on a fixed price contract is that if estimates to complete the contract change from one period to the next  profit levels will vary from period to period 
for all types of contracts  we recognize anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable 
out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are included in contract revenue and cost of contract revenue 
unbilled expenditures and fees on contracts in process are the amounts of recoverable contract revenue that have not been billed at the balance sheet date 
unbilled expenditures and fees relate principally to revenue that is billed in the month after services are performed 
in certain instances  billing is deferred in compliance with contract terms  such as milestone billing arrangements and withholdings  or delayed for other reasons 
billings which are expected to be deferred more than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent assets 
costs related to certain us government contracts  including applicable indirect costs  are subject to audit by the government 
revenue from such contracts has been recorded at amounts we expect to realize upon final settlement 

table of contents our metrigraphics business segment records revenue from product sales upon transfer of both title and risk of loss to the customer  provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
product sales are recorded net of sales taxes and net of returns upon delivery 
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling is classified as product sales 
the cost of shipping products to the customer is recognized at the time the products are shipped and are recorded as cost of product sales 
goodwill and other intangible assets with the acquisition of impact innovations in and other businesses in  we acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition  as well as the completion of annual impairment tests  require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are made based on  among other things  consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant and reviews of projected cash flows 
as a result of the annual impairment test performed as of december   we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill did not exceed its fair value and  accordingly  did not record a charge for impairment 
however  there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired in subsequent periods 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million in the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes and deferred taxes as part of our process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefits from deferred taxes 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we had a net deferred liability of million at december  we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent a recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
at december   we determined that a valuation allowance was not required 
pension obligations accounting and reporting for our pension plan requires the use of assumptions  including but not limited to  the discount rate and expected rate of return on assets 
these assumptions are used by independent actuaries to estimate the total benefit ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries 
the assumed discount rate  which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled  is determined by a spot rate yield curve method 
the spot rate yield curve is adjusted to match the plan assets cash outflows with the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments 
as of the pension plans measurement date  the weighted average discount rate used to determine both the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs was 
the assumed expected rate of return on plan assets  which is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants  is determined by an annual review of historical plan asset returns and consultation with outside investment advisors 
as of the pension plans measurement date  the weighted average expected rate of return was 
a decrease of basis points in the expected rate of return would increase the annual pension expense by approximately million in both and 
table of contents during  the assumptions used in determining net periodic cost were consistent to actual results 
if these assumptions differ materially from actual results in the future  our obligations under the pension plan could also differ materially  potentially requiring us to record an additional pension liability and record additional pension costs 
an actuarial valuation of the pension plan is performed each year 
the results of this actuarial valuation are reflected in the accounting for the pension plan upon determination 
at december   we recorded a pension liability of million in the consolidated balance sheets that represented the unfunded projected benefit obligation 
results of operations operating results in millions and results expressed as a percentage of total revenues are as follows year ended december  contract revenue product sales total revenue gross profit on contract revenue gross profit on product sales total gross profit selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets operating income interest expense  net other income  net provision for income taxes net income these amounts represent a percentage of contract revenues  product sales and total revenues  respectively 
revenue we reported total revenue of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
total revenue decreased by in compared to resulting from a decline in contract revenue 
total revenue increased by in compared to due from the revenues added through the acquisition of impact innovations on september  contract revenues contract revenues in our systems and services segment were earned from the following sectors in millions year ended december  national defense and intelligence federal civilian agencies state and local government agencies other total contract revenue 
table of contents the decrease in revenues from national defense and intelligence agencies in compared to was due to curtailment of work with the air national guard  reduced work with the us air force electronic systems center and the loss of the office of assistant secretary of defense for public affairs work in october the increase in compared to was attributable to revenues added through the acquisition of impact innovations 
our contract with the asc  which provided approximately million  million and million of revenues in  and  respectively  was subject to re competition in as the caps contract 
in april  hmrtech hj ford sba jv was awarded a caps contract  under which task order competition is expected to be completed in we believe we are well positioned to retain our base of services provided by hj ford employees and compete for new business 
with the first year re competitions under the new caps contract estimated at complete  annual revenue from the awards to date is anticipated to reach million  growing by more than over the last year of the preceding task order periods  excluding subcontractor revenue 
the periods of performance for the task awards range from one to five years 
the task orders include a mix of time and material and firm fixed price awards 
the new task order awards provide us with the opportunity to continue to expand our presence within the wings  groups and squadrons at asc and other key us air force organizations at wright patterson afb  ohio 
caps is the primary contract vehicle for delivering multi functional support including consulting  program management  logistics  engineering  financial management  and business transformation services to a variety of asc  us air force materiel command  us air force research laboratory customers and to other wright patterson air force base organizations 
also  related to the new caps contract structure  work performed by other contractor team members on these programs  which under the predecessor contract was passed through our revenue and cost of sales  will be contracted directly between hmrtech hj ford sba jv and the subcontractor and will no longer be included in our financial results 
the total annual effect of eliminating the revenue and cost of sales pass through  estimated at million  prior to the re competitions  is not included in the million of revenues we have anticipated under the new caps contract 
our contract with the esc  which provided approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  is subject to re competition 
the services provided under our current contract are being procured by the esc under two new contract vehicles  the engineering technical administration support services etass contract and the professional acquisition support services pass contract 
proposals for their contracts have been submitted and are awaiting award 
we currently anticipate a single etass contract award in the second quarter of and the award of multiple pass contracts in the fourth quarter of we have participated in the competitions for these contracts as a subcontractor 
the full year revenue impact of moving from a prime contractor to a sub contractor role is anticipated to be an approximate million revenue reduction with no material effect on operating profit 
there can be no assurance that we will receive these contract awards 
the decrease in revenues from federal civilian agencies in compared to was due to the loss of the internal revenue service contract in  partially offset by higher revenues from new dhs and fdic contracts that were awarded in the second half of the increase in compared to was also attributable to revenues added through the acquisition of impact innovations 
the decrease in revenues from state and local government agencies in compared to was primarily due to lower revenues under our contract with the state of ohio  under which a significant portion of the development work has been completed 
in may  we were awarded a fixed price contract with the state of ohio to design  develop and install an automated child welfare case management system 
this million contract has a three and one half year base period  plus a one year option 
revenues under this contract were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to a full year effect of revenue in from the state of ohio contract 

table of contents revenues by contract type as a percentage of systems and services segment revenues were as follows year ended december  time and materials cost reimbursable fixed price  including service type contracts prime contract sub contract product sales product sales for the metrigraphics segment were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue from product sales for the metrigraphics segment in compared to primarily was due to a decrease in computer peripheral device sales 
the decrease in compared to primarily was due to a decrease in computer peripheral device sales  partially offset by an increase in medical technology equipment sales 
funded backlog our funded backlog was million at december   million at december  and million at december  we expect that substantially all of our backlog at december  will generate revenue during the year ending december  the funded backlog generally is subject to possible termination at the convenience of the contracting party 
contracts are generally funded on an annual basis or incrementally for shorter time periods 
due to current budgetary pressures  we have seen an increase in the application of incremental funding  thereby reducing backlog in proportion to revenue 
a portion of our funded backlog is based on annual purchase contracts and subject to annual governmental approval or appropriations legislation and the amount of funded backlog as of any date can be affected by the timing of order receipts and deliveries 
gross profit total gross profit was million  million and million resulting in a gross margin of  and for  and  respectively 
our gross profit on contract revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the change in gross profit resulted in a gross margin of  and for  and  respectively 
the decline in gross profit in compared to was primarily attributable to a decline in revenue and increases in indirect costs including costs related to a reduction in workforce  an increase in business development efforts  share based compensation  higher provisions for the valuation of our unbilled expenditures and fees on contracts in process and changes in revenue mix 
unusually high severance costs of million were recorded in cost of contract revenue in compared to million in share based compensation costs reduced gross profit in by million related to our adoption of sfas r at the beginning of in the near term  we anticipate continuation of the lower gross margin as a result of a continued high level of investment in business development  bid and proposal activities 
the improvement in gross margin on contract revenues in compared to resulted from lower employee benefit cost and acquisition integration efficiencies  which resulted in a lower level of indirect overhead costs along with lower sub contractor and other direct costs  expressed as a percentage of revenues 
our gross profit on product sales was million  million and million  and  respectively 
the slight decline in gross profit in both comparable periods was primarily attributable to a lower 
table of contents level of revenues 
this resulted in a decline in gross margin of  and in  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily the result of lower costs for salaries and benefits resulting from the workforce reductions  as well as other cost reduction efforts 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expenses of million in compared to million in the increase in compared to was primarily the result of higher costs resulting from the impact innovations acquisition  partially offset by lower employee benefit related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  expressed as a percentage of revenues  were in and in both and as a percentage of revenue  selling general and administrative expenses have increased in compared to due to revenues decreasing at a faster rate than expenses and an increase in share based compensation costs and severance costs associated with workforce reductions 
reductions in in finance  it  benefits and other administrative costs expressed as a percentage of revenues were partially offset by an increased level of investment in business development and an increase in recruiting costs due to higher turnover 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense  which relates to the amortization of acquired intangible assets  was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increased level of expense in compared to was related to a full year of amortization expense from the intangible assets identified with the impact innovations acquisition 
interest expense  net we incurred interest expense totaling million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to lower average borrowings  partially offset by a higher average interest rate 
the increase in interest expense in compared to was primarily attributable to a full year of borrowing under the acquisition loan used to fund the september  acquisition of impact innovations  coupled with interest on the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility and the term loan facility 
interest expense in included only four months of interest on the acquisition term loan and a full year of interest on the outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility and the term loan facility 
the interest rate on our current financing vehicle is variable 
this vehicle is more fully described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
the weighted average interest rates on our outstanding borrowings were   and at december   and  respectively 
we recorded approximately million of interest income in each of  and other income  net we recorded million  million and million of net other income in  and  respectively 
in and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of realized gains resulting from the sale of shares of common shares of lucent technologies  inc lucent during those periods 
in accordance with the equity method of accounting  other income includes recognition of our portion of income or loss related to our investments in hmrtech and hmrtech hj ford sba jv 
we recorded income related to our equity investments of million in each of the three years ended approximately million in and approximately million in both and  was included in other income attributable to gains on our deferred compensation plan investments 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the income tax provision was recorded at rates of in  in  and in 
table of contents these rates reflect the statutory federal rate of in and in both and the tax rate reflects the implementation of sfas r for certain stock awards and the relative impact of permanent difference due to a lower profit before tax balance  increase in tax rates applied to deferred income taxes  partially offset by favorable state income tax audits and tax credits and adjustment of tax accruals and reserves 
shares used in computing earnings per share weighted average common shares outstanding and common equivalent shares totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in shares in compared to was related to million additional shares issued  partially offset by a decreased dilutive effect on employee stock options due to a lower average annual stock price 
the increase in from was primarily attributable to million additional shares issued  partially offset by a reduction in the number of employee stock options counted as outstanding common equivalent shares due to their anti dilutive effect 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating  investing and financing activities as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are subject to certain trends  events and uncertainties  including demands for capital to support growth  economic conditions  government payment practices and contractual matters 
our need for access to funds is dependent on future operating results  our growth and acquisition activity and external conditions 
based upon our present business plan and operating performance  we believe that cash provided by operating activities  combined with amounts available for borrowing under the revolver  will be adequate to fund the capital requirements of our existing operations during and for the foreseeable future 
in the event that our current capital resources are not sufficient to fund requirements  we believe our access to additional capital resources would be sufficient to meet our needs 
however  the development of adverse economic or business conditions could significantly affect the need for and availability of capital resources 
at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily the result of million of net cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by million and million of cash used in investing and financing activities  respectively 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of million during was primarily attributable to improved billings and receivable collections and non cash charges  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million in and  respectively 
total accounts receivable and unbilled expenditures and fees on contracts in process were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
billed accounts receivable decreased million in and million in  while total unbilled amounts decreased million in and increased million in total accounts receivable including unbilled amounts days sales outstanding  or dso  was days at december  and days at december  at december   the unbilled receivables balance included million related to our contract with the state of ohio 
under the current terms of the contract  this amount is anticipated to be invoiced and collected in accordance with completion of contract milestones 
based on current projected milestone completions  we anticipate payments on this contract of approximately million in 
table of contents deferred taxes on unbilled receivables totaled approximately million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in deferred taxes resulted from a reduction in tax deferred unbilled costs and fees and tax payments related to our settlement of the and income tax audits 
the internal revenue service irs also has initiated an audit of our income tax return 
the irs continues to challenge the deferral of income for tax purposes related to our unbilled receivables including the applicability of a letter ruling issued by the irs to us in january which granted to us deferred tax treatment of our unbilled receivables 
we have requested and the irs has agreed to allow this issue to be elevated to the irs national office for determination 
while the outcome of the audit is not expected to be known for several months and remains uncertain  we may incur interest expense  our deferred tax liabilities may be reduced and income tax payments may be increased substantially in future periods 
share based compensation increased to million in  from million in and million in the increase in is due to our adoption of sfas r beginning january  during  we realigned our approach to share based compensation by increasing the issuance of restricted stock awards and reducing the issuance of stock options 
as a result  higher share based compensation was recorded in compared to we anticipate lower share based compensation in due to the actions approved by the board of directors to amend our employee stock purchase plan during the fourth quarter of  as more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
non cash amortization expense of our acquired intangible assets was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that non cash expense for the amortization of intangible assets to decrease to approximately million in our defined benefit pension plan was underfunded by million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in the underfunded amount was due to an additional pension contribution and actions approved by the board of directors to amend the plan during the fourth quarter of  which removed the annual benefit inflator for active participants in the plan as of december  this amendment  which freezes each participant s calculated pension benefit  is anticipated to reduce pension costs  net of other changes in assumptions  by approximately million in compared to during and  contributions of million and million  respectively  were made to fund our pension plan 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of million during was primarily attributable to capital expenditures 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in and net cash used in investing activities was million in capital expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
for all years  capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of computing equipment and for leasehold improvements  other than for the enterprise business system and the andover facility renovation 
expenditures for the peoplesoft based enterprise business system  which was initially placed in service on january   were million and million in and  respectively 
expenditures for the andover facility renovation were million and million in and  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures in to be at similar levels as during and  we sold our lucent shares for million and million  respectively  realizing a gain on the sale of million and million  respectively 
we currently do not hold any investments classified as available for sale and therefore do not expect any proceeds from the sale of investments in future periods 
on december   we sold our headquarters facility in andover  massachusetts and entered into a lease for the same property for a ten year term with two five year renewal options 
proceeds realized from the sale were million resulting in a gain of million that will be recognized over the ten year term of the lease 
during  the company amortized million of the deferred gain and estimates a similar benefit in subsequent periods through the end of the lease 

table of contents in  we expended million related to the acquisition of impact innovations 
the acquisition is more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
we believe that selective acquisitions are an important component of our growth strategy 
we may acquire  from time to time  firms or properties that are aligned with our core capabilities and which complement our customer base 
we will continue to consider acquisition opportunities that align with our strategic objectives  along with the possibility of utilizing the credit facility as a source of financing 
financing activities on september   we entered into a new revolving credit facility the facility with a bank group to amend and restate the then existing credit facility entered into on september  the facility provides for a million  three year revolving credit agreement for working capital needs 
on an ongoing basis  the facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants  including maintaining a minimum net worth and certain cash flow and debt coverage ratios 
the covenants also limit our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  purchase capital assets  sell or dispose of assets  make additional acquisitions or investments  or enter into new leases  among other restrictions 
in addition  the facility provides that the bank group may accelerate payment of all unpaid principal and all accrued and unpaid interest under the facility  upon the occurrence and continuance of certain events of default 
at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
additional information related to the facility is referenced in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
during  net cash used in financing activities of million represented principal payments under the acquisition term loan of million  partially offset by million of net borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
the outstanding balances on our facility  which consisted of an acquisition term loan balance of million and a revolving credit facility balance of million  were paid off and re borrowed under the revolver as part of the facility 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our facility which has been classified as long term as amounts borrowed under the revolver are contractually due on the maturity of the facility  however we may repay at any time prior to that date 
during  net cash used in financing activities was million  which consisted of million of repayments under the acquisition term loan  million of repayments under the revolver and million of repayments under the term loan  partially offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was comprised of million from the acquisition term loan  million of net borrowings under the revolver and million of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
we entered into our then existing financing arrangement  of which million was related to the acquisition of impact innovations 
we repaid million of the principal borrowed immediately after the initial consideration paid for impact innovations was reduced to million 
our proceeds from financing activities were partially offset by million of acquisition term loan principal payments  including the million of principal repaid immediately as discussed above  million for deferred financing costs and million of principal payments under the term loan 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not utilize or employ any off balance sheet arrangements during the three years ended december   defined as i an obligation under a guarantee contract  ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement  iii an obligation  including a contingent obligation  under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument or iv an obligation  including a contingent obligation  arising out of a variable interest 

table of contents commitments our contractual obligations as of december  consist of the following in millions payments due by period less than two to four to total one year three years five years thereafter long term debt operating leases letter of credit total contractual obligations the amounts above related to the long term debt do not include interest payments on the revolver outstanding principal balance  because the interest rates are not fixed 
the amounts above related to operating leases are net of sublease rentals of million for both periods due less than one year and due two to three years 
on december   the company entered into a purchase and sale agreement and lease in connection with the sale and leaseback of the company s headquarters in andover  massachusetts  pursuant to which the company sold and leased back the building  real property and certain items of personal property at the company s headquarters  including the company s interest in certain contracts pertaining to the building  real property and personal property 
the term of the lease is ten years and includes two five year options to renew 
the agreement also provides that the company pay for certain improvements by the end of the third lease year 
the company entered into a million letter of credit  which is required to be maintained until days after the completion of the improvements 
contingencies we are a party to litigation and other proceedings as referenced in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
except as noted therein we do not presently believe it is reasonably likely that any of these matters would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our evaluation of the likelihood of expenditures related to these matters is subject to change in future periods  depending on then current events and circumstances  which could have material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows
