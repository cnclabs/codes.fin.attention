item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report 
overview we design  develop  market and license memory technologies used by the semiconductor industry and electronic product manufacturers 
we have developed a patented semiconductor memory technology  called t sram that offers a combination of high density  low power consumption and high speed at performance and cost levels that other available memory technologies do not match 
we license this technology to companies that incorporate  or embed  memory on complex integrated circuits  such as socs 
we have also sold memory chips based on our t sram technologies  but in  we ceased actively selling them 
we do not expect to make and sell memory chips in the future 
using elements of our existing memory technology as a foundation  we completed development of our first memory chips incorporating our t sram technologies in the fourth quarter of we signed our first license agreement related to our t sram technologies at the end of the fourth quarter of and recognized licensing revenue from our t sram technologies for the first time in the first quarter of since then  we have introduced improved and enhanced versions of our technology  such as t sram r  t sram m  and t sram q 
we generate revenue from licensing our memory technologies  which revenue consists of licensing revenues  customization services  maintenance and support fees and royalties 
royalty revenues are earned under each of our license agreements when our licensees manufacture or sell products that incorporate any of our t sram technologies and report the results to us 
generally  we expect our total sales cycle  or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties from the licensee s use of our t sram technologies  to run from to months after the commencement of the project 
the portion of our sales cycle from the initial discussion to the receipt of license fees may run from six to months  depending on the complexity of the proposed project and degree of customization required 
in  we began delivering our new family of t sram classic memory macro products to licensees 
these macros are silicon proven  high density solutions offering customers rapid memory block integration into their soc designs 
they are pre configured and require minimal additional customization  and we believe they will enable us to increase our penetration of the market for very dense  low power  high speed embedded memory applications 
sources of revenue we generate two types of revenue licensing and royalties 
licensing 
our license agreements involve long sales cycles  which makes it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed 
in addition  our licensing revenues fluctuate from period to period  and it is difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue from quarter to quarter 
moreover  we believe that the amount of licensing revenues for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period 
our future revenue results are subject to a number of factors  particularly those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
our licensing revenue consists of fees for providing circuit design  layout and design verification and granting a license to a customer for embedding our memory technology into its product 
for some customers  we also provide engineering support services to assist in the initial production of products utilizing the licensed t sram technologies 
license fees generally range from  to several million dollars per contract  depending on the scope and complexity of the development project  and the extent of the licensee s rights 
the licensee generally pays the license fees in installments at the beginning of the license term and upon the attainment of specified milestones 
the vast majority of our contracts allow billing between milestones based on work performed 
fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
for license agreements that do not require significant development  modification or customization  revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
if any of these criteria is not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
for license agreements where a license is granted and no other deliverables are required  revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
however  if the agreement involves performance specifications that we have significant experience in meeting and the cost of contract completion can be reasonably estimated  we recognize revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed under the percentage of completion accounting method 
we use actual direct labor hours incurred to measure progress towards completion 
we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to determine whether the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate and update our estimated costs to complete as necessary 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 
if the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer  then under the percentage of completion accounting method  we account for the excess amount as an unbilled contract receivable 
our total unbilled contract receivable was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
for agreements involving performance specifications that we have not met and for which we lack the historical experience to reasonably estimate the costs  we defer recognition of all revenue and related direct costs until all deliverables are met and recognize revenue under the completed contract accounting method 
from time to time  a licensee may cancel a project during the development phase 
such a cancellation is not within our control and is often caused by changes in market conditions or the licensee s business 
cancellations of this nature are an aspect of our licensing business  and most of our contracts allow us to retain all payments that we have received or are entitled to collect for items and services provided before the cancellation occurs 
we will consider a project to have been canceled even in the absence of specific notice from our licensee  if there has been no activity under the contract for more than six months  and we believe that completion of the contract is unlikely 
in this event  we recognize revenue in the amount of cash received  if we have performed a sufficient portion of the development services 
if a cancelled contract had been entered into before the establishment of technological feasibility  the costs associated with the contract would have been expensed prior to the recognition of revenue 
in that case  there would be no costs associated with that revenue recognition  and gross margin would increase for the corresponding period 
in  we recognized  of licensing revenue from cancelled contracts  compared to  in and none in royalty 
each of our license agreements provides for royalty payments at a stated rate 
we negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the anticipated volume of the licensee s sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee through the use of our technology 
our license agreements generally require the licensee to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs 
as with our licensing revenues  the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict 
they depend on the licensee s ability to market  produce and sell products incorporating our technology 
many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are consumer products  such as electronic game consoles  for which demand can be seasonal and generally highest in the fourth quarter 
for a discussion of factors that could contribute to the fluctuation of our revenues  see part i  item a 
risk factors our lengthy licensing cycle and our licensees lengthy product development cycle will make the operating results of our licensing business difficult to predict  and anything that negatively affects the businesses of our licensees could negatively impact our revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis we make these estimates based on our historical experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and reported results could differ under different assumptions or conditions we apply estimates and judgments in the following manner licensing revenue recognition 
for license agreements that do not require significant development  modification or customization  revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
for license agreements  which require no deliverables  revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
as a consequence  the timing of this revenue recognition depends upon our subjective evaluation of each of these elements 
for those contracts requiring us to develop a design that meets a licensee s specifications  we apply sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in accordance with sop when license agreements include deliverables that require significant production  modification or customization  contract accounting is applied 
if a licensing contract involves performance specifications that we have significant experience in meeting and the direct labor hours to be incurred to complete the contract can be reasonably estimated  we recognize the revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method includes judgmental elements  such as determining that we have the experience to meet the design specifications and estimation of the total direct labor hours 
we follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contracted services 
the direct labor hours for the development of the licensee s design are estimated at the beginning of the contract 
as these direct labor hours are incurred  they are used as a measure of progress towards completion 
we have the ability to reasonably estimate direct labor hours on a contract by contract basis from our experience in developing prior licensee s designs 
during the contract performance period  we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete 
our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known 
under the percentage of completion method  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined 
for contracts involving design specifications that we have not met previously  we defer the recognition of revenue until the design meets the contractual design specifications and expense the cost of services as incurred 
when we have experience in meeting design specifications but believe that we do not have significant experience to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours related to services to meet a design specification  we defer both the recognition of revenue and the cost 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 
under the completed contract method  we recognize revenue when we complete the milestones 
in and  none of our license revenue was recognized under the completed contract method 
we also provide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements 
under these arrangements  we provide unspecified upgrades  design rule changes and technical support 
no other upgrades  products or other post contract support are provided 
when we provide a combination of services related to licensing and support and maintenance to customers  in addition to the considerations noted above  we evaluate the arrangements under eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
specifically  we analyze the separate elements to determine if vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  exists for the undelivered elements 
we believe we have established vsoe for our support and maintenance arrangements 
these arrangements are renewable annually by the customer 
support and maintenance revenue is recognized at its fair value ratably over the period during which the obligation exists  typically months 
revenue from support and maintenance service represented  and  in and  respectively  and was included in licensing revenue in the statement of operations 
royalty revenue recognition 
licensing contracts also provide for royalty payments at a stated rate based on actual units produced and or sold 
licensees generally report the manufacture or sale of products that include our t sram technologies after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs 
as such  we generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee s report 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recognized royalty revenue related in the same quarter of due to a contract amendment with a customer  which enabled us to report royalty revenue one quarter earlier than the previous contract 
as a result of this contract amendment  additional royalty revenue representing of total revenue was recognized in the fourth quarter of in future quarters  we will continue to recognize royalty revenue related to this amendment in the same quarter in which the units are sold 
in the first quarter of  we began recognizing two types of prepaid royalties pre production royalties  which cover a fixed number of future unit shipments and are paid in a lump sum when we enter into the licensing contract  and post production royalties  which are paid in a lump sum after the licensee commences production of the royalty bearing product and applied against future unit shipments 
in either case  payments from these prepaid royalties are non refundable 
under current contracts  pre production prepaid royalties are inseparable from our licensing activities 
thus  we include pre production prepaid royalties in licensing revenue 
post production prepaid royalties  which are recognized at the time of the billing provided that no future performance obligations exist  are included in royalty revenue 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of approximately million  of which approximately million was attributable to canadian loss and research and development pool carryforwards  and million was attributable to us and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
stock based compensation 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb standard no 
revised  share based payment sfas r effective january  and selected the modified prospective transition method  which requires us to recognize the fair value of the stock based compensation in the net income loss in the current and future periods and not to restate the impact of the adoption on the prior period financial statements 
upon adoption  we began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the value of each employee stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes model for the purpose of the pro forma financial disclosure in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical and implied volatility of our stock price 
based on unvested stock options outstanding as of december   the total compensation costs expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years is approximately million 
see note stock based compensation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more discussion 
results of operations the following discussion compares the historical results of operations based on us generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended december   and for these three years  results of operations as a percentage of net revenue were as follows year ended december  net revenue product licensing royalty total net revenue cost of net revenue product licensing total cost of net revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring expenses litigation settlement total operating expenses operating loss interest and other income income tax benefit provision net loss years ended december   and revenue 
in  total revenue increased to million representing a increase from total revenue in licensing revenue increased to million in from million in due to revenue recognized from several significant licensing contracts for our nm and nm process technology in royalty revenue increased to million in from million in primarily due to a contract amendment with a customer  which allowed us to report royalty revenue one quarter earlier than the previous contract 
as a result of this contract amendment  additional royalty revenue representing of total revenue was recognized in in future quarters  we will continue to recognize royalty revenue related to this amendment in the same quarter in which the units are sold 
in  the royalty earned from the production of gamecube chips decreased to of total revenue  compared to in  as the gamecube video game products approached the end of their product life cycles 
in  total revenue increased to million representing a increase from total revenue in licensing revenue increased to million in from million in mainly due to increased numbers of projects commenced under new contracts signed in and revenue generated under a large contract signed in and completed in royalty revenue decreased to million in from million in as customer sales of chips incorporating our technology declined 
royalties related to the production of nintendo gamecube chips in was million  which was consistent with royalties in in  total revenue was million primarily from licensing and royalty activities 
total revenue was reduced by  for a reimbursement given to a customer for excess verification costs incurred by the customer 
during the years ended december  and  our product sales were minimal 
during the year ended december   product sales were  in the second quarter of  we notified customers of our decision to discontinue sale of our memory chip products 
as of the end of the third quarter of  we had no remaining product inventory of value 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in mainly due to an increase in our licensing revenue 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from in primarily due to a higher licensing gross profit  which increased to of total licensing revenue in from of total licensing revenue in this increase in licensing gross profit as a percentage of licensing revenue resulted from lower costs for fulfilling our obligations under large high margin contracts and our classic memory macro projects 
this cost reduction was partially offset by stock based compensation expense of  recorded under sfas r 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to sfas r in in addition  pre production prepaid royalties included in licensing revenue contributed to an increased gross profit as a percentage of total revenue because such royalties have no associated cost 
gross profit increased to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in our licensing revenue 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from in primarily due to a higher licensing gross profit  which increased to of total licensing revenue in from of total licensing revenue in this increase occurred because of a lower cost for fulfilling our obligations under new license agreements which required less customization 
gross profit decreased to million in primarily due to the significant decline in our licensing revenue 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in due to the decline in licensing gross profit which fell to of total revenue in this decline occurred because we incurred higher cost under new license agreements than we had originally estimated or had historically experienced 
in addition  we recognized revenue under some lower margin license projects including a few contracts in which our estimated cost exceeded the amount of revenue to be recognized 
research and development 
our research and development expenses include development and design of variations of the t sram technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees and the development and testing of prototypes to prove the technological feasibility of embedding our memory designs in the licensees products 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to a lower allocation of expenses to cost of licensing revenue in because of the high margin contracts  which requires less customization and engineering efforts 
research and development expenses also increased as a result of the stock based compensation expense of  under sfas r 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in mainly due to the closure of our atmos research and development facility in ottawa  canada in november of there were no research and development expenses incurred at the atmos facility in as compared to million incurred in research and development expenses decreased to million in mainly because more engineering time was spent on licensing development projects  and therefore  more engineering expenses were allocated to cost of licensing revenue in effective november   we closed the atmos research and development facility in ottawa  canada and terminated the employment of approximately employees working there 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in mainly due to stock based compensation expense of million under sfas r 
expenses related to the uniram litigation in totaled approximately million 
expenses related to testing and assessment of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section of sarbanes oxley act were approximately  in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in when we incurred million of expenses related to the aborted acquisition by synopsys  inc and legal expenses related to litigation with synopsys over its abandonment of the acquisition  as well as  of expenses related to the uniram litigation 
we did not incur synopsys related costs in  but incurred approximately million of legal expenses related to the clams brought by uniram 
expenses related to testing and assessment of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section of sarbanes oxley act were approximately  in in addition to the synopsys and uniram related expenses in  expenses related to testing and assessment of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section of sarbanes oxley act were approximately  litigation settlement 
on october   we entered into a settlement agreement with uniram under which we and uniram agreed to dismiss all outstanding claims and counterclaims with prejudice  and we paid uniram million and received a complete release of all claims as well as a future fully paid license for ourselves and all of our licensees with respect to uniram s relevant intellectual property 
interest and other income 
interest and other income increased to million in from million in primarily due to higher interest rates but offset by a charge of  recorded in related to japan withholding taxes paid by japanese licensees on our behalf 
we do not expect any additional withholding tax reimbursement in the future as the us japan income tax treaty that took effect july  generally eliminated withholding taxes on royalties 
interest and other income decreased to million in from million in  which included a million merger termination fee paid by synopsys 
interest income increased to million in from million in due to higher interest rates in stock based compensation 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r effective january   million was recognized as stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  of this amount   was related to the issuance of options to purchase our stock to newly appointed members of our board of directors that had an exercise price less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of the option grant  which is permitted under our option plan 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded stock compensation expenses of  and  respectively  of which and   respectively  was attributable to the excess of the fair market value of our common stock over the price at which we granted stock options to employees  which was permitted under our option plan 
in and  we incurred  and  respectively  of stock compensation expenses related to the issuance of options to purchase our stock to newly appointed members of our board of directors that had an exercise price less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of the option grant  which was permitted under our option plan 
stock compensation expenses in also included  for amortization of deferred compensation cost attributable to the fair market value of shares of our common stock issued to certain employees of atmos 
during the year ended december   we recorded deferred compensation cost of  which would be amortized in future periods 
no such costs were incurred in the deferred compensation costs represented the intrinsic value of options granted to purchase shares of our stock to newly appointed members of our board of directors that had an exercise price less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the option grant  which was permitted under our option plan 
this deferred compensation cost is being amortized over the vesting period of months using the graded vesting method 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  deferred compensation expense was amortized using the graded vesting method over the vesting period of each respective option  generally four years 
the accelerated amortization results in expensing approximately of the total award in the first year  in the second year  in the third year and in the fourth year 
provision for income taxes 
provisions benefit for income taxes of approximately   and  were recorded in   and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was for  for  and for as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes  approximately million for state tax purposes and canadian loss and research and development pool carryforwards of approximately million that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal  canadian and applicable state income tax laws 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire from to the change in our effective tax rate in was mainly due to an increase in foreign taxes 
in  we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will be less than the federal statutory tax rate but higher than the effective income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments and auction rate securities of million and long term investments of million resulting in a total balance of cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million 
as of the same date  we had total working capital of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments and auction rate securities of million and long term investments of million resulting in a total balance of cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million 
as of the same date  we had total working capital of million 
our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs 
we believe that our current focus on licensing and royalty revenues with reduced levels of memory chip sales has generally enabled us to steadily improve our liquidity 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
in  net cash used in the operating activities primarily consisted of the net loss million  an increase in accounts receivable by million  reduced deferred revenue of  and decreased accrued expenses and other liabilities of  offset by the non cash impact of stock based compensation of million under sfas r  and a non cash charge of  for depreciation and amortization 
in  net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of net loss of million offset by a non cash charge of  for depreciation and amortization and higher deferred revenue of  in addition  net cash used in operating activities in included tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options of  which was recorded under additional paid in capital 
in  net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net loss of million offset by a non cash charge of million for depreciation and amortization  reduced unbilled contract receivables of million  and prepaid expenses and other assets of  which included a reduction in deferred tax assets in in addition  net cash provided by operating activities in included restructuring related liabilities of  net cash provided by used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended   and  respectively 
in  in addition to the investing activity of marketable securities  we purchased  of property and equipment  consisting principally of engineering design software 
in  aside from investing in marketable securities  we added million of property and equipment primarily due to leasehold improvements related to our new office lease for our us corporate headquarters beginning in june  new testing equipment and engineering design software 
we also purchased  of property and equipment in  consisting principally of engineering design software 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was approximately million  million  and  for the years ended   and  respectively 
we received proceeds in the amount of million and million in and  respectively  from the exercise of employee options to purchase common stock 
in  the major financing use of cash was million for the repurchase of million shares of common stock 
we received proceeds in the amount of million from the exercise of employee options to purchase common stock during our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter  depending on numerous factors  including level and timing of licensing and royalty revenues  cost  timing and success of technology development efforts  including meeting customer design specifications  market acceptance of our existing and future technologies and products  competing technological and market developments  cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights  variations in manufacturing yields  materials costs and other manufacturing risks  costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations  and profitability of our business 
we expect that existing cash  and equivalents  short term and long term investments along with our existing capital and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we expect that a licensing business such as ours generally will require less cash to support operations 
however  we cannot be certain that we will not require additional financing at some point in time 
should our cash resources prove inadequate  we may need to raise additional funding through public or private financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could have a material  adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
lease commitments and off balance sheet financing the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payment due by period total less than year years over years operating lease obligations sublease income the company did not have any unconditional purchase obligations as of december  recent accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio consists of money market funds  auction rate securities  corporate backed debt obligations and mortgage backed government obligations 
the portfolio dollar weighted average maturity of these investments is within twelve months 
our primary objective with investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
in accordance with our investment policy  we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities  which approximate million as of december  and have an average interest rate of approximately  are subject to interest rate risks 
as of december   our portfolio had unrealized losses of approximately  as a result of rising interest rates 
we believe these losses are temporary and expect to hold these investments to maturity 
however  based on the investment portfolio contents and our ability to hold these investments until maturity  we believe that if a significant change in interest rates were to occur  it would not have a material effect on our financial condition
