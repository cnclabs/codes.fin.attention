item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
company overview we are a global pharmaceutical technology company that applies proprietary materials science  formulation research and manufacturing innovation to the quality  therapeutic value  development speed and rapid market availability of pharmaceuticals  biologics  vaccines and consumer products 
we have manufacturing locations in north and south america  europe and asia pacific  with affiliates in mexico and japan 
our business is conducted through two segments pharmaceutical systems and tech group 
our pharmaceutical systems segment focuses on primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery  including stoppers and seals for vials  and closures and disposable components used in syringe  intravenous and blood collection systems 
the tech group operating segment offers custom contract manufacturing solutions utilizing plastic injection molding processes targeted to healthcare and consumer industries 
our global customer base includes the world s leading manufacturers of pharmaceuticals  biologics and medical devices 
in recent years  our pharmaceutical systems business has experienced an increased demand for its product offerings 
we believe this demand is due to a combination of factors including an aging population that is expected to consume more healthcare products and services  the increased occurrence and treatment of chronic disorders  including diabetes  and increased spending on healthcare in the world s developing economies 
additional demand for our products has been generated by the approval of new biotechnology drug products delivered by injection or iv infusion  frequently as a lyophilized freeze dried powder that requires reconstitution at the point of use 
our tech group segment benefits from some of the same factors that impact our pharmaceutical systems segment  particularly for products such as insulin pens and iv filters 
the tech group is one of two contract manufacturers for an inhalation delivery device used in connection with exubera inhalation powder  a pulmonary insulin product developed by our customer nektar therapeutics that is marketed by pfizer  inc pfizer currently markets the product in the united kingdom  ireland and germany and plans an expanded roll out of exubera to primary care physicians in the united states in we have met our increased demand requirements principally by pursuing manufacturing programs focused on increasing our production capacity at all existing operations  adding additional shifts to our production schedule and requiring employees to work overtime 
many of our european operations are working at or near of current capacity 
due to the factors cited above  management expects that demand will continue to increase in all our geographic regions  particularly in asia as the developing economies of china and india create additional markets for our products 
in view of projected sales growth and favorable market trends we expect to accelerate the expansion of our production capacity in the next several years  estimating capital spending to be approximately million  with more than of the spending in support of our pharmaceutical systems business 
we intend to expand molding production and tooling capacity at existing facilities in germany  france  singapore  serbia and the united kingdom 
we also intend to establish a manufacturing presence in the peoples republic of china resulting in a new plastic injection molding plant  with planned completion in  and we have initiated agreements to form a joint venture with a local medical rubber manufacturer  designed to lead to a new rubber components plant that we expect to be completed in  subject to the transfer of manufacturing licenses and necessary government and regulatory approval 
approximately of our capital spending is targeted for the tech group segment  including a significant plant relocation that we believe should result in additional medical device production capacity 
our principal source of short term liquidity is a million committed revolving credit facility expiring in borrowings under the revolving credit agreement were million and outstanding letters of credit were million at december   leaving million available for future use under the facility 
our revolving credit agreement also contains an uncommitted million accordion feature which allows the revolving credit facility to be temporarily expanded to million 
we believe that cash flow generated by operations together with our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our capital spending and development programs 
however management continues to evaluate other financing alternatives which could be more cost efficient or provide greater flexibility for general corporate uses including strategic acquisitions complementary to our core businesses 
our key financial performance indicators include sales and operating income growth  earnings per share  corporate cash flow operating cash flow  less capital expenditures and dividends paid and return on invested capital 
sales for were above levels  with the timing impact of our acquisitions and foreign exchange translation contributing and percentage points of the increase  respectively 
operating profit in was higher than in earnings from continuing operations in were per diluted share compared to per diluted share in our results for include a pretax loss on extinguishment of debt of million million  net of tax  or per diluted share and a gain on a tax refund issue of million or per diluted share 
corporate cash flow in was million  an increase of million over that achieved during despite higher capital expenditures related to our europe asia plant expansions and the relocation of one of our tech group facilities 
return on invested capital for was 
west s non financial performance indicators including on time delivery  product discrepancy resolution and compliance tests  also generally indicated high levels of performance  although on time delivery metrics have declined as a result of capacity issues 
results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our operating results for the three years ended december   and our financial position as of december   should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the operating results of our former clinical service unit and drug delivery research business are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our financial statements include the results of acquired businesses for periods subsequent to their acquisition date 
for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year to year results  reference is made in management s discussion and analysis to results excluding the timing impact of acquisitions and the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
those re measured period results are not in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and are non gaap financial measures 
the non gaap financial measures are intended to explain or aid in the use of  not as a substitute for  the related gaap financial measures 
net sales the following table summarizes net sales by reportable segment and product group in millions pharmaceutical packaging disposable medical components personal care products laboratory and other services pharmaceutical systems segment healthcare devices consumer products tooling mold construction tech group segment intersegment sales total net sales compared to consolidated net sales were million  an increase of over sales reported in net sales for include a full twelve months of results from the businesses acquired during the acquired businesses  consisting of tgi  medimop and monarch  are included in results for periods subsequent to their acquisition date 
the timing impact of our acquisitions accounts for percentage points of the sales increase 
favorable foreign currency translation contributed percentage points of the sales increase 
excluding the timing impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation  net sales increased over sales 
in the pharmaceutical systems segment  net sales of million were million   above levels 
the timing impact associated with the acquisitions of medimop and monarch accounted for percentage points of the increase 
foreign currency translation accounted for another percentage points of the sales increase 
excluding the timing impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation  net sales in the pharmaceutical systems segment were  above those achieved in sales growth was achieved in both domestic and international markets with sales increases of in the united states and in international markets 
sales of pharmaceutical packaging components were million above those recorded in  accounting for of the sales growth in the pharmaceutical systems segment 
sales of stoppers molded from elastomeric formulations and used in the packaging of serum vials  lyophilized products and fitments for intravenous systems accounted for almost of the sales increase in pharmaceutical packaging components 
we continue to experience strong demand for our westar processed components 
westar is our process for preparing components for direct entry in customers sterilization units  which helps to increase the efficiency of customer manufacturing operations 
sales of specially coated stoppers  including flurotec films and teflon barriers  represented approximately half of the overall increase in stopper sales  with a portion of that demand representing the return to normal customer ordering patterns and inventory levels following formulation changes that reduced sales levels 
net sales of pre filled syringe components such as plungers  needle shields and tip caps accounted for approximately of the sales increase in pharmaceutical packaging components with particularly strong demand in international markets resulting from injectable treatments for diabetes  anemia and thrombosis 
our drug reconstitution  mixing and transfer products featuring needleless devices and packaging systems contributed approximately of the increase in sales of pharmaceutical packaging components  largely reflecting a full year s sales from the medimop business acquired in the third quarter of net sales of our flip off seals  a combination plastic button and aluminum shell used in vial packaging  contributed of the increase in pharmaceutical packaging components with strong demand in the united states for a customer s injectable therapy for kidney dialysis patients 
in other pharmaceutical systems product groups  sales of disposable medical components increased million over the prior year  largely due to an improved sales mix in non filled syringe components which more than offset an overall decrease in unit volumes in this category 
net sales of personal care products  laboratory and other services remained approximately equal to prior year levels 
in our tech group segment  net sales were million above those reported in the prior year 
the acquired tgi business accounted for million of the increase in segment sales  of which million is attributed to the timing of the acquisition 
the remaining million of the acquired business s sales increase represents volume related gains  approximately of which is attributed to net sales of a pulmonary drug delivery device for the inhaleable insulin product exubera inhalation powder  licensed by pfizer inc and developed by our customer  nektar therapeutics 
other healthcare device revenues resulting from the assembly of insulin pen injection devices and increased sales of consumer products account for the remainder of the acquired business s volume related gains 
our previously existing plastic molding operations  that represent the balance of the tech group segment  recorded a net sales increase of million over the prior year on higher sales of juice container closures  nurser assemblies  and containers for pain relief medication  contraceptives and weight loss products 
compared to our consolidated net sales increased over sales reported in sales in the tgi  medimop and monarch businesses are included in results for periods subsequent to their acquisition date and represented percentage points of the sales increase versus the prior year 
favorable foreign currency translation contributed percentage points of the sales increase 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation  net sales increased over sales 
in the pharmaceutical systems segment  net sales were million  or  above levels 
acquired businesses contributed million of sales to results 
foreign currency translation variances were million favorable to the prior year 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation  net sales in the pharmaceutical systems segment were million  or  above those achieved in sales in international markets generated the majority of the sales increase driven by strong demand for pharmaceutical packaging components used in pre filled syringe systems for the delivery of our customers insulin products for diabetes  cancer treatments  vaccines and dental applications 
sales growth in the united states was moderated by the impact of planned formulation changes in specialty coated stoppers used in serum and lyophilized pharmaceutical packaging products 
our customers increased their inventory levels of these products during in order to ensure adequate supplies for pending approval of the formulation changes 
in our tech group segment  net sales were million  with the acquired tgi business accounting for million of segment sales consisting of healthcare devices million  consumer products million and tooling projects million 
excluding the results of the acquired business  our previously existing plastic molding operations yielded net sales of million and were above levels 
increased sales of consumer products  led by increased demand for custom plastic parts used in juice containers  was partially offset by declines in healthcare device  tooling and other revenues related to the closure of our uk medical device facility 
gross profit the following table summarizes gross profit and gross margin by reportable segment in millions pharmaceutical systems gross profit gross margin tech group gross profit gross margin consolidated gross profit gross margin compared to consolidated gross profit improved to million in  a million increase over results 
the timing of the acquisitions accounts for million million in the tech group segment of the increase in gross profit as includes these businesses for the full twelve month period as compared to partial year periods in increased sales volumes and improvement in the sales product mix in both segments of our business accounted for nearly all of the non acquisition related increase in consolidated gross profit 
in the pharmaceutical systems segment our gross margins improved percentage points with a favorable product mix contributing percentage points of that increase 
higher sales volumes and efficiency improvements accounted for the remaining pharmaceutical systems segment gross margin increase  while sales price increases fully offset higher raw material  plant overhead and utility costs 
in the tech group segment  gross margins improved to  almost one percentage point higher than the prior year 
an improved product mix  reflecting increased sales of healthcare devices which accounted for of tech segment sales in compared to in  contributed a two percentage point improvement in tech segment gross margin  however this was partially offset by higher material  utility and labor costs which exceeded related sales price increases 
compared to consolidated gross profit improved to million in  a million increase over results 
the acquired businesses contributed million of the increase in gross profit  million within the tech group segment 
the pharmaceutical systems segment accounted for the remaining gross profit increase  generated by higher sales volumes in europe and improved operating efficiencies in north america resulting from the resumption of normal molding operations at our re built kinston  north carolina facility 
the impact of the acquired businesses on our consolidated gross margin in was a reduction of percentage points reflecting the increase in lower margin revenues within the acquired tgi business 
gross margins in the pharmaceutical systems segment improved by percentage points over the prior year as many of the interim production costs incurred during the construction and validation of the new facility were not incurred during overall product mix variances in were negligible as the decline in higher margin coated product sales within the pharmaceutical systems segment were offset by increased sales of pre filled syringe systems and westar processed products with similar margins 
tech group segment gross margins decreased by one percentage point compared to the prior year  mostly reflecting the increased proportion of tooling revenues within the acquired business which carry gross margins averaging less than five percent 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs the following table summarizes sg a costs by reportable segment including corporate and unallocated costs for the three year period ending december  in millions pharmaceutical systems sg a costs pharmaceutical systems sg a as a of segment net sales tech group sg a costs tech group sg a as a of segment net sales corporate costs general corporate costs stock based compensation costs unallocated us pension plan expense total selling  general administrative costs total sg a as a of total net sales compared to consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in were million above those recorded in approximately million of the increase is due to the timing impact of our acquired businesses which are included in for the periods subsequent to their acquisition and for a full twelve month period in in the pharmaceutical systems segment  sg a expenses were million above the prior year 
the timing of the medimop acquisition accounts for million of this increase 
approximately million of the increase was due to increased staffing and funding for research and innovation projects aimed at discovering new technologies or developing new applications for existing processes such as westar  daikyo s resin cz and pre filled syringes 
compensation costs in europe and asia were million higher than  reflecting a combination of annual salary increases  staffing increases in sales and production support functions  and higher performance based incentive compensation 
organization and travel costs primarily related to the establishment of our business in china were million higher in compared to foreign currency translation accounted for million of the sg a increase 
other expenses associated mostly with higher facility costs and social taxes accounted for the remaining million increase in pharmaceutical systems segment sg a costs 
tech group segment sg a costs were million above the prior year 
the timing of the tgi acquisition accounts for million of the increase 
the initial participation in incentive compensation programs and increased staffing levels in human resource functions  quality and internal control positions accounted for the remaining sg a increase 
general corporate sg a costs include executive compensation and other costs  board of directors compensation  legal  compliance  finance and communication expenses 
in  these costs were million higher than in as a result of exceeding performance targets  incentive compensation awards accounted for million of the increase  including a million increase in award programs for plant administration and hourly personnel 
other general corporate compensation costs increased million due mostly to increased finance and legal staffing and higher salary and fringe benefit costs 
professional service costs were million above those recorded in primarily as a result of higher tax consulting costs connected with prior year tax refund issues 
stock based compensation costs increased by million over those incurred in primarily due to the increase in west stock price indexed deferred compensation program costs for our board of directors and a non qualified deferred compensation plan for executive management 
as of december  these deferred compensation plans held  stock equivalent units 
our stock price at december  was per share compared to per share at december  the resulting change in the fair value of our stock equivalent unit liabilities accounts for nearly all of the million increase in our stock based compensation expense 
costs of other stock based compensation programs  including stock options  performance vesting share rights and employee stock purchase programs  remained approximately even with prior year levels as moderately higher stock option compensation was offset by lower costs associated with the employee stock purchase program us pension plan costs were million  exceeding costs by million 
the increase in us pension costs is primarily due to changes in actuarial mortality assumptions 
on october  our board of directors approved an amendment to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in the united states 
under the amended plan  benefits earned under the plan s pension formulas for both hourly and salaried participants were frozen as of december  effective january   new cash balance formulas will be implemented for covered hourly and salaried participants and new hires  pursuant to which a percentage of a participant s compensation will be credited to a participant account each year 
including the impact of these changes  we estimate us pension plan expense will be approximately million 
we expect the decrease in pension costs to be largely offset by increased costs for our k savings plan covering certain salaried and hourly us employees  which was also amended effective january   resulting in a change in employer contributions to a match on the first of employee contributions  and a match on the next of employee contributions 
in  the company match was equal to of each participant s contribution up to of the participant s base compensation 
compared to consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were million above those reported in sg a costs within the acquired business units accounted for million of the increase  million in the pharmaceutical systems segment and million in the tech group segment 
other increases in pharmaceutical systems segment costs over are attributed to higher compensation costs of million associated with annual salary increases and sales incentive programs  increased consulting costs of million for information systems projects  lean manufacturing programs and marketing studies and unfavorable foreign exchange variances of million 
excluding the impact of the tgi acquisition  other tech group segment sg a costs decreased by million due to lower consulting costs within our previously existing plastic molding operations 
general corporate costs decreased by million in from levels primarily as a result of a decrease in legal fees connected with the kinston explosion and related fire 
stock based compensation costs in were million lower than in the january  adoption of statement of financial accounting standard share based payment revised sfas r resulted in the recognition of million of sg a expense connected with our stock option and employee stock purchase plan programs which did not require expense recognition in under previous accounting standards 
the adoption impact of sfas r was more than offset by a million decrease in directors and executive deferred compensation plan expense and a million decrease in costs associated with performance vesting share pvs rights to senior management 
as previously noted  the value of our deferred compensation plans is indexed to the company s stock price 
the increase in our stock price during resulted in million of stock appreciation and compensation expense on these plans  our stock price remained constant during beginning and ending the year at per share resulting in no stock price based appreciation expense in the decrease in pvs costs is principally connected with the initial performance award which vested entirely upon results rather than the two and three year performance periods associated with subsequent awards 
us pension plan expenses were approximately even with levels 
restructuring charge benefit in we reached final settlement of all remaining lease obligations connected with the closure of a plastic device manufacturing plant in the united kingdom resulting in the reduction of previously estimated cost accruals of million in we ceased all production activities at the uk operation and recorded a million restructuring charge for the excess of future lease costs over expected sub lease rental income  as well as additional severance expense and repair costs necessary to return the leased facility to its original condition 
the initial decision to close the uk plant was made in resulting in a million charge which included asset retirement obligations  impairment charges and provisions for statutory post employment benefit costs 
other expense other expense consists of gains and losses on the sale or disposal of equipment and other assets  foreign exchange transaction items  miscellaneous royalty and sundry transactions 
in millions pharmaceutical systems segment tech group segment corporate and unallocated items total other expense other expenses were million above those recorded in our pharmaceutical systems segment recorded a million charge connected with the impairment of assets involved in the production and licensing of one of our reconstitution products following a substantial reduction in projected orders  causing a decline in our fair value estimates for this product line 
the impairment charge includes a million reduction to the value of the dedicated production assets for this product  a million minimum royalty payment called for under our licensing agreement and a million decrease in the value of our licensing rights 
the remaining versus other expense increase principally relates to the sale or disposal of surplus equipment 
operating profit operating profit loss by reportable segment  corporate and other unallocated costs were as follows in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group us pension expenses general corporate costs stock based compensation costs unallocated restructuring items consolidated operating profit our operating profit increased by million  or  over that achieved in the timing impact of our acquisitions accounts for million of the operating profit increase  million in the pharmaceutical systems segment and million in the tech group segment 
the remaining increase in operating profit was generated by sales growth and gross margin improvements in both of our business segments  partially offset by higher costs associated with deferred compensation obligations indexed to our stock price 
the businesses acquired during contributed million pharmaceutical systems million and tech group million of the million consolidated operating profit increase over the remaining to operating profit improvement in the pharmaceutical systems segment was principally the result of increased sales volumes in europe and lower production costs in the united states following the resumption of normal production activities at our kinston facility 
in addition to the impact of the acquired business  tech group segment operating profit also benefited from cost savings following the closure of the former uk facility 
loss on debt extinguishment on february  we prepaid million in senior notes carrying a interest rate and a maturity date of april  under the terms of the original note purchase agreement dated april   the prepayment of the notes entitled note holders to a make whole amount of million in order to compensate them for interest rate differentials between the yield on the notes and current market rates for the remaining term of the note 
the prepayment was financed by issuing million approximately million of new senior unsecured notes having a weighted average maturity of just over nine years at a weighted average interest rate of  before costs 
the lower interest notes are expected to reduce annual pre tax financing costs by approximately million 
interest expense net the following table summarizes our net interest expense for the three year period ended december  in millions interest expense capitalized interest interest income interest expense net our net interest expense decreased million from levels 
the refinancing of our million senior notes resulted in interest savings of million 
these savings were partially offset by unfavorable interest rate variances on our revolving debt of million  and million resulting from higher average borrowing levels associated with the financing and timing of our business acquisitions 
interest income includes million of interest paid to us in connection with the settlement of tax refund issues 
net interest expense increased million over the prior year 
higher average borrowing levels resulting from our acquisition activity accounted for million of the interest expense increase 
the remaining million increase in interest expense was caused by higher interest rates on variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
income taxes the effective tax rate on consolidated income from continuing operations was in  in and in income tax expense in includes a net million favorable adjustment primarily resulting from the closure of the us federal tax audit year and a million tax benefit resulting from a tax refund associated with the disposition of our former plastic molding facility in puerto rico 
the combined impact of these two items reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points 
in we repatriated million in earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the united states parent companies 
the foreign repatriations were made in accordance with the provisions of the american jobs creation act of ajca 
the ajca provided a temporary incentive for us multi national companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in controlled foreign corporations by providing an percent dividends received deduction on qualified distributions occurring before december  our results include a million net tax charge million gross tax cost  less million of foreign tax credits and million in previously established accruals for unremitted earnings incurred in connection with the repatriation program which increased our overall effective tax rate by percentage points 
the restructuring credit in the uk allowed us to utilize prior year loss carry forwards and therefore decreased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
in addition  we reduced tax contingencies connected with the closure of tax years in certain international locations resulting in a percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the utilization of foreign tax credits on the filing of a prior year us tax return  a change in french tax law extending the life of net operating loss carry forwards and the reversal of reserves attributable to the closing of tax years 
the combined impact of these items  offset partially by the non deductible restructuring charge  resulted in a percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate 
equity in affiliates the contribution to earnings from our ownership interest in daikyo seiko  ltd 
in japan and ownership interest in three companies in mexico was income of million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
our equity income from daikyo was million below that recorded in daikyo s sales and operating growth were approximately above those achieved in  however the increase in the us dollar relative to the japanese yen fully offset the operational gains 
daikyo s results include a million loss related to a decision by daikyo to demolish an existing facility in order to proceed with the construction of a new plant 
the charge was largely offset by an unrelated gain on an investment security 
our equity income from our mexican affiliates declined million from levels following the transfer of some customer products to our fully owned plant in kinston  north carolina 
our equity income was million lower than that achieved in primarily due to the impact on daikyo s results of customer purchases during of a product in advance of a pending fda approval of a required product reformulation 
the increased customer inventory levels accumulated during resulted in lower sales levels for daikyo in as customers utilized existing inventory pending validation of the new formulation 
the operating results of the mexican affiliates improved on strong sales growth generating results equal to those recorded in which included a non operating million gain on the sale of real estate 
our purchases from all affiliates totaled approximately million in  million in and million in  the majority of which relates to our distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and re sell daikyo products 
sales to affiliates were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share 
our results include a pre tax million loss on debt extinguishment million net of tax  or per diluted share and the favorable resolution of a claim for a tax refund associated with the disposition of our former plastic molding facility in puerto rico resulting in the recognition in income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  consisting of a million tax benefit and related interest income  net of tax  of million 
our net income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share 
these results included incremental income tax expense of million  or per diluted share  associated with the repatriation of foreign sourced income under the american jobs creation act of results for also include a restructuring credit which increased net income from continuing operations by million  or 
per diluted share 
net income from continuing operations in was million  or per diluted share 
results for include incremental manufacturing costs of million million  net of tax  or per diluted share associated with the interim production processes that were put in place following a explosion and fire at our kinston nc plant 
results also include kinston related legal expenses of million million net of tax  or per diluted share 
the closure of a manufacturing plant in the uk resulted in restructuring charges of million per diluted share 
equity income included a million per diluted share real estate gain 
results also include million per diluted share of favorable tax adjustments resulting from utilization of foreign tax credits on the filing of a prior year tax return and a change in french tax legislation 
prior to the adoption of sfas r on january  we had accounted for stock compensation using the intrinsic value method 
had the fair value method prescribed by sfas r been applied to earlier periods  our results would have included additional pre tax stock compensation costs for stock options and the employee stock purchase plan of million million net of tax  or 
per diluted share for the year ended december  discontinued operations our income from discontinued operations was million  or per diluted share 
as a result of a favorable outcome to our claim for tax benefits relating to the sale of our former contract manufacturing and packaging business  we received a tax refund resulting in the recognition of a million tax benefit 
the settlement of this claim also resulted in pre tax interest income of million million after taxes 
we also recognized a million favorable adjustment to tax accruals associated with our former drug delivery systems segment primarily as a result of the closure of the us federal tax audit year 
income from discontinued operations was million  or per diluted share 
the majority of the income was generated from the august sale of the clinical services unit pre tax gain of million  million net of tax 
operating losses and other costs associated with the sale of our former drug delivery business completed in the first quarter of totaled million million  net of tax  more than offsetting the operating income of million million  net of tax generated by the clinical services unit prior to its divestiture 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell our drug delivery business 
the sales price consisted of million receivable due in cash at the closing date and a ownership interest in the new company valued at million 
as a result of the transaction  we recorded a pre tax loss of million million after tax  or per diluted share 
the million net tax expense was primarily the result of the reversal of current and prior year tax benefits that were no longer available as a result of the transaction 
in december we also announced our intention to exit the clinical services business 
the operating results of the drug delivery business and clinical service unit are classified within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the pre tax loss from the discontinued drug delivery and clinical services operations was million for financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows generated from operations totaled million in  compared to million in our growth in operating cash flow was led by pharmaceutical systems north american operations which generated strong operating profit growth while reducing working capital levels 
operating cash flow in pharmaceutical system s europe asia operating segment and our tech group segment also improved over prior year levels  moderated by higher inventory requirements 
consolidated capital spending for totaled million  a million increase over capital spending 
capital spending in our pharmaceutical systems segment accounted for million of the increase  with million of the increase occurring in europe and asia 
in addition to the initial spending on plant expansions throughout europe and asia  major projects included new presses used in the production of our trimtec closures for iv bottles  additional rubber compression molding equipment and increased westar capacity in germany  a new vision inspection process in france  additional equipment for lining materials used in insulin packaging in denmark and the purchase of land for an expanded administration building in germany 
in the tech group segment  capital spending was million more than in  with the relocation and expansion of a plant in michigan accounting for of the increase 
general corporate and other projects declined by million from prior year levels 
and cash flows provided by investing operations each include a million loan repayment received from our affiliate in mexico 
in net cash of million was used to acquire monarch  tgi  and medimop 
cash provided by investing activities in includes million of insurance proceeds related to the kinston accident  which helped to fund the reconstruction of the new facility 
cash flows used in financing activities include the prepayment of million of senior notes on february  we financed the prepayment by issuing million of new senior unsecured notes with a usd value of approximately million 
million of the notes have a maturity of years with an interest rate of while the remaining million of the notes have a maturity of years and an interest rate of 
our strong operating cash flow in has allowed us to reduce borrowing under our revolving credit agreements by million from year end levels 
financing cash flows in include proceeds from stock option exercises and related tax benefits totaling million 
dividends paid to shareholders were million per share 
the board of directors intends to continue the practice of declaring dividends following their quarterly review of the west pharmaceutical services inc s financial condition and results of operations 
management expects that cash flows from continuing operations  net of capital spending requirements  will provide sufficient funding for the current dividend policy 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect the obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total in millions unconditional purchase obligations long term debt interest on long term debt operating lease obligations pensions other post retirement obligations total contractual obligations future interest payments on variable rate debt were calculated using the applicable ending interest rate at december  we have letters of credit totaling million supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers and to guarantee equipment lease payments in ireland and the payment of sales tax liabilities in the united states 
the accrual for insurance obligations was million at december  at december  our consolidated debt was million and our debt to total invested capital total debt  minority interests and shareholders equity ratio was compared to at december  our cash and cash equivalents balance was million at december   compared to million at december  our december  net working capital totaled million and the ratio of current assets to liabilities was to we believe that our financial condition  current capitalization and expected income from operations will continue to be sufficient to meet our future expected cash requirements 
off balance sheet agreements at december   the company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs and leased equipment and sales tax liability guarantees as noted above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions  some of which are subjective and complex  that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating the results of operations and financial position of west pharmaceutical services  inc revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is generated from our standard product manufacturing operations which convert rubber  metal  and plastic raw materials into component parts used in closure systems and syringe components for use with injectable drugs and drug delivery devices 
sales of manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes 
management records rebate costs based on its assessment of the likelihood that these volumes will be attained 
we also establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
approximately of our revenue is generated by the construction of tools  molds or automation equipment 
these projects generally take several months to complete and utilize west s experienced personnel and wholly owned tool shops 
we record revenue on a percentage of completion basis utilizing the ratio of actual cost incurred over total costs estimated for each project 
additionally  if at any time during the life of a project  it is determined that the estimated project cost will exceed the purchase commitment from the customer  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recorded immediately 
impairment of long lived assets we review goodwill and long lived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs 
our reporting units are the same as our operating segments  which we have determined to be the americas and europe asia pacific divisions of the pharmaceutical systems segment  and the tech group segment 
for assets held and used in the business  management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit 
when assets are held for sale  management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset  less disposition costs 
changes in the estimate of fair value  including the estimate of future cash flows  could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
employee benefits the measurement of the obligations under our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans are subject to a number of assumptions 
these include the rate of return on plan assets and the rate at which the future obligations are discounted to present value 
for us plans  which account for of global plan assets  the long term rate of return assumption decreased to in from in in  the long term rate of return assumption remains 
the return assumption is reviewed annually and determined by the projected return for the expected mix of plan assets approximately equity and debt securities 
the discount rate increased basis points to at december   to reflect current market conditions 
the discount rate selected is the single rate equivalent for a theoretical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that produces a cash flow pattern equivalent to the plans projected benefit payments 
changes in these estimates  including the market performance of plan assets and other actuarial assumptions  could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
every basis point reduction in the long term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by approximately million 
a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million 
as described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements  benefit plans  included within item of this form k  we amended the benefit formulas used in our us defined benefit plans  resulting in a million reduction in our projected benefit obligations 
the impact of the plan amendment will be recognized as a reduction to pension expense over a year period representing the estimated average remaining service period of plan participants affected by the amendment 
on december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
the new standard requires the recognition of an asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as measured by the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation 
for a pension plan  the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation  for any other postretirement plan  such as a retiree health plan  the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
the adoption of sfas resulted in a reduction of shareholders equity of million million pre tax  less a million deferred tax benefit at december  income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation 
in addition  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability  generally at the local subsidiary company and country level 
changes in tax legislation  business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments  which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements 
fin prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and income tax disclosures 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of this interpretation must be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of fin the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin must be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
management is in the process of determining what impact  if any  the adoption of fin will have on our financial statements 
inventories accounting for inventories involves estimates regarding the proper determination of manufacturing cost  obsolescence and identifying inventory values that exceed estimated market values 
the determination of manufacturing cost includes the identification of direct material costs and allocations of direct labor  variable production costs and overhead 
allocations of fixed overhead costs are based on estimates of normal capacity and require judgment when production levels are below normal so that idle capacity costs are expensed in the period incurred 
the valuation of inventories is also subject to usage or flow assumptions 
during the first quarter of  we changed our method of inventory costing from last in first out lifo to first in first out fifo for certain inventory located in the united states  which accounted for approximately of our total consolidated inventory at december  the majority of our inventory had already been accounted for under  primarily  the fifo method 
the change was made to facilitate a comparison of our financial results with those of our principal competitors and customers on such measures as inventory levels and turnover  gross margin and operating earnings 
we also believe that using the fifo method provides a better match of expenses and revenues and provides a more consistent inventory costing method within our operating segments  thus  the change in accounting was considered preferable 
the impact of the change has been applied retrospectively and the financial statements have been adjusted for all prior periods presented

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates and foreign currency rate fluctuations 
these risk factors can impact results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
from time to time  we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts 
derivatives used by us are highly effective as all of the critical terms of the derivative instruments match the hedged item 
effectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with company policy  derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 
all debt securities and derivative instruments are considered non trading 
foreign currency exchange risk we have subsidiaries outside the us accounting for approximately of consolidated net sales 
virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars 
although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are in the local currency of the subsidiary and are therefore translated into us dollars  the foreign subsidiaries may also hold assets or liabilities not denominated in their local currency 
these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
as a result  our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing exchange rates 
we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize month end balance sheet exposures on cross currency intercompany loans 
as of december  we have a forward exchange contract of million ending on january  that protects us against the variability in future cash flows related to raw material purchases by european subsidiaries denominated in us dollars usd 
the terms of the arrangement set a base rate of usd per euro and a limit rate of usd per euro 
we are protected against a strengthening usd by restricting the exchange rate to the base rate 
we would participate in gains caused by a weakening usd up to the limit rate 
if the limit rate is exceeded at the expiration date  the company agrees to buy usd at the base rate for that month 
there are no cash payments required and no income statement effect of an exchange rate between the base and limit rates 
as of december  the euro was equal to usd 
we have designated our million debt as a hedge of our investment in the net assets of our european operations 
a million cumulative foreign currency translation loss on the million debt is recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  we also have a billion yen denominated note payable which has been designated as a hedge of our investment in a japanese affiliate

portions of long term debt which are payable during are classified as short term liabilities as of december  the following table summarizes our interest rate risk sensitive instruments thereafter carrying value fair value in millions current debt and capital leases euro denominated average interest rate fixed long term debt and capital leases us dollar denominated average interest rate variable us dollar denominated average interest rate variable euro denominated average interest rate fixed euro denominated average interest rate variable krone denominated average interest rate variable yen denominated average interest rate variable as of december  we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding which are designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on a million note maturing on july  series a note and a million note maturing july  series b note 
the first interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million and corresponds to the maturity date of the series a note and the second interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million and corresponds with the maturity date of the series b note 
under each of the swap agreements we will receive variable interest rate payments based on three month libor in return for making quarterly fixed payments 
including the applicable margin  the interest rate swap agreements effectively fix the interest rates payable on series a and b notes payable at and  respectively 
at december   the interest rate swap agreements had a fair value of million favorable to the company and are recorded as a non current asset
