table of contents in september  millennium restructured its mortgage operations 
prior to september  millennium was recording gross gains on mortgage sales  which were offset by compensation expense and other direct expenses for the mortgage department 
under the new structure  the activities of millennium capital  inc  a subsidiary of millennium bank  were terminated  and millennium established contractual relationships with three mortgage banking limited liability companies  the terms of each of which provide for a per loan fee to be paid to millennium the owner of the llc s for each mortgage loan sold and requires the owners to pay for all costs of operation while retaining all other fee income 
at december   millennium terminated the business relationship by written notice 
we formed millennium financial  inc on february   to provide insurance services to our bank customers through metropolitan life insurance company 
strategy we have been in operation for just under eight years  and an important part of our business is our current and future strategies 
our strategies include the following goals attract customers by providing the financial sophistication and breadth of products of a regional bank while maintaining the quick response and service of a community bank 
in our first seven years of operations  we have established a diverse product line  including commercial  small business administration  consumer  and mortgage loans 
we also have introduced securities brokerage services and insurance 
increase net income and return to shareholders through continued quality loan growth  while controlling the cost of our deposits and noninterest expense 
diversify our loan portfolio through use of our diverse array of commercial and small business administration loan products 
we are also focused on increasing our core deposits  reducing our dependence on brokered deposits and attracting additional small business customers 
proceed with a branch realignment strategy to expand our footprint into the one of the fastest growing counties in the nation while at the same time improving the overall visibility and accessibility of our branch network 
subject to regulatory approvals  millennium intends to relocate  early in the nd quarter  its wiehle reston and great falls offices to a newly constructed office in sterling  virginia in loudoun county market area we consider our target market to be the greater washington metropolitan area  which we define as the district of columbia  the northern virginia counties of fairfax  fauquier  loudoun and prince william  and the maryland counties of frederick  montgomery and prince george s 
our target market also includes richmond  virginia and the surrounding counties of chesterfield and henrico 
according to the us census data  the population of the greater washington metropolitan area was approximately million people 
the average median household income figures reported in the us census for each of the jurisdictions comprising the greater washington metropolitan area was approximately  compared to a national median household income of approximately  based on estimates released by the bureau of labor statistics of the us department of labor for september  the unemployment rate for the greater washington metropolitan area was approximately  compared to a national unemployment rate of 
according to us census figures  approximately of adults at least years of age in this area have a bachelor s degree or higher  compared to approximately nationally 
as of june   total deposits in this area were approximately billion 
our headquarters is located approximately miles west of washington  dc  in reston  virginia  which is in fairfax county 
the dc census data indicates that fairfax county is the most populous county in 
table of contents virginia with a population of approximately one million people and a median household income of over  the us census data shows that over of fairfax county adults at least years old have a bachelor s degree or higher 
competition our headquarters is in the reston herndon market area where there is a limited community bank presence 
it is a community serviced by the branches of large regional banks that are headquartered  for the most part  in cities outside the washington dc metropolitan area 
our market area is a highly competitive  highly branched banking market 
we compete as a financial intermediary with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market mutual funds and other financial institutions operating in the fairfax county market area and elsewhere 
competition in the market area for loans to small businesses and professionals is intense  and pricing is important 
most of our competitors have substantially greater resources than millennium 
many competitors offer services  such as extensive branch networks and trust services  we currently do not provide 
moreover  larger institutions operating in the northern virginia market have access to borrowed funds at lower costs than are available to the bank 
deposit competition among institutions in the market area also is strong 
as a result  it is possible that we will pay above market rates to attract deposits 
according to a market share report prepared by the fdic  we held of deposits in the fairfax county market as of june   the most recent date for which market share information is available 
credit policies the principal risk associated with each of the categories of loans in millennium s portfolio is the creditworthiness of its borrowers 
within each category  credit risk is increased or decreased  depending on prevailing economic conditions 
in an effort to manage the risk of loans made  our policy gives loan approval limits to individual officers based on their position and experience 
loans that are held for sale are underwritten to investor guidelines 
all fixed rate residential first mortgage loans are pre sold prior to settlement on the loan 
millennium bank has written policies and procedures to help manage credit risk 
we have implemented a loan review process that includes portfolio management strategy  underwriting standards and risk assessment guidelines  procedures for ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration  and regular portfolio reviews to establish loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the bank s policies 
millennium bank uses an officers loan committee and directors loan committee to approve loans 
the officers loan committee  which consists of the chairman and additional officers  meets as necessary to review most applications for loans that are intended to be held in the portfolio 
a directors loan committee  which currently consists of six directors  approves loans in excess of  that have been previously approved by the officers loan committee 
the directors loan committee also reviews lending policies proposed by management 
we obtain small business and commercial loans through direct solicitation of owners and continued business from customers 
the bank s loan officers review completed commercial loan applications 
as part of the application process  information is obtained concerning the income  financial condition  employment and credit history of the applicant 
if commercial real estate is involved  information is also obtained concerning cash flow after debt service 
loan quality is analyzed based on the bank s experience and its credit underwriting guidelines  as well as guidelines issued by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
in the normal course of business  the bank makes various commitments and incurs certain contingent liabilities  which are disclosed in the footnotes of its annual financial statements  including commitments to extend credit 
at december   commitments to extend credit totaled million and standby letters of credit totaled million 

table of contents commercial lending general 
commercial business loans and commercial real estate loans generally have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans  but have commensurately higher yields 
to manage these risks  we generally secure appropriate collateral  obtain personal guarantees from principals  and monitor the financial condition of our business borrowers 
the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself 
further  the collateral for commercial business loans may depreciate over time and cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate 
at december   commercial loans totaled million  or of the total loan portfolio 
we have implemented a credit review and monitoring system to review the cash flow of commercial borrowers 
residential mortgage loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from his her employment and other income and are secured by real estate  the value of which tends to be easily ascertainable 
in contrast  commercial business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from cash flow from its business and are secured by assets  such as commercial real estate  accounts receivable  equipment and inventory 
real estate loans 
commercial real estate loans may be secured by various types of commercial real estate in millennium s market area  including multi family residential buildings  commercial buildings and offices  small shopping centers  and churches 
in its underwriting of commercial real estate  the bank may lend up to of the secured property s appraised value 
the bank s commercial real estate loan underwriting criteria require an examination of debt service coverage ratios  the borrower s creditworthiness and prior credit history and reputation  and generally requires personal guarantees or endorsements of borrowers 
at december   commercial real estate loans totaled million  or of the total loan portfolio 
construction loans 
our loan policy allows for local construction loans  primarily to individual small builders on a limited basis 
at december   there was million in construction and land development loans outstanding in the commercial real estate loan portfolio 
the bank will obtain a first lien on the property as security for its construction loans and personal guarantees from the borrower s principal owners 
small business lending 
today  the principal activity of the bank s commercial loan division is the origination of commercial mortgage and non mortgage loans to small and medium sized businesses 
we regularly use various loan guarantee programs offered through the small business administration  including the loan program  which is intended to help small and medium sized businesses avoid large down payments and floating interest rates that are typically associated with purchases of fixed assets used to expand operations 
whenever possible  the loan program provides long term and fixed rate financing for investment in fixed assets  primarily real estate and large heavy equipment 
at december   small business administration loans totaled approximately million 
one to four family residential real estate lending we may retain in our portfolio loans secured by one to four family residences  some of which are located in our market area 
we also may retain non conforming adjustable rate mortgages for consumers that do not reside in our market area 
we evaluate both the borrower s ability to make principal and interest payments and the value of the property that will secure the loan 
we make first mortgage loans in amounts of up to ltv of the appraised value of the underlying real estate  but retain in our portfolio some loans with an ltv or less appraised value 
we retain some second mortgage loans secured by property in various market areas 
second mortgage loans with a loan to value ratio over are underwritten to institutional investor guidelines 
for conventional loans in excess of loan to value  private mortgage insurance is secured insuring the mortgage loans to loan to value 
our current one to four family residential adjustable rate mortgage loans have interest rates that adjust every    or years  based on a spread over the rates on one year us treasury bills 
millennium s adjustable rate mortgage loans generally limit interest rate increases to each rate adjustment period and have an established ceiling rate at the time the loans are made of up to over the original interest rate 
borrowers are qualified at the first year interest rate plus 
there are risks resulting from increased costs to a borrower as a result of the periodic repricing mechanisms of these loans 
despite the benefits of adjustable rate mortgage loans to an 
table of contents institution s asset liability management  they pose additional risks  primarily because as interest rates rise  the underlying payments by the borrowers rise  increasing the potential for default 
at the same time  the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates 
we minimize these risks by underwriting these loans to be sold in the secondary mortgage market 
millennium requires title opinions and fire and casualty insurance coverage  as well as title insurance and flood insurance where appropriate  to protect millennium s interest 
the borrower pays the cost of this insurance coverage 
we typically require escrows for taxes and insurance 
consumer lending millennium offers various secured and unsecured consumer loans  including unsecured personal loans and lines of credit  automobile loans  deposit account loans  installment and demand loans  letters of credit  home equity loans and beginning in  marine loans 
such loans are generally made to customers with a pre existing relationship with millennium or to new customers in the greater washington  dc area including maryland and virginia 
marine loans are also originated through a channel of approved dealers and brokers 
consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans  particularly in the case of unsecured consumer loans  such as lines of credit  or loans secured by rapidly depreciable assets such as automobiles 
in such cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage  loss or depreciation 
the underwriting standards employed by the bank for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant s payment history on other debts and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan 
the stability of the applicant s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income for primary employment  and additionally from any verifiable secondary income 
although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration  the underwriting process also includes an analysis of the value of the security in relation to the proposed loan amount 
only fiberglass hull power boats and sail boats are considered under the marine lending program 
employees at december   millennium had full time equivalent employees 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit or union 
millennium believes that its relations with employees are satisfactory 
supervision and regulation general 
as a financial holding company  we are subject to regulation under the bank holding company act of  as amended  and the examination and reporting requirements of the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
other federal and state laws govern the activities of our bank subsidiary  including the activities in which it may engage  the investments that it makes  the aggregate amount of loans that it may grant to one borrower  and the dividends it may declare 
these laws are intended primarily to protect depositors and customers of the bank  not shareholders of millennium 
our bank subsidiary is also subject to various consumer and compliance laws 
as a national bank  millennium bank is subject to primary regulation  supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
the following description summarizes the significant federal and state laws applicable to us 
to the extent that statutory or regulatory provisions are described  the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to that particular statutory or regulatory provision 
the bank holding company act 
under the bank holding company act  we are subject to periodic examination by the federal reserve and required to file periodic reports regarding our operations and any additional information that the federal reserve may require 
the activities of a bank holding company are generally limited to banking  managing or controlling banks  furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries  and 
table of contents engaging in other activities that the federal reserve has determined by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to these activities 
some of the activities that the federal reserve board has determined by regulation to be closely related to the business of banking include making or servicing loans and specific types of leases  performing specific data processing services and acting in some circumstances as a fiduciary or investment or financial adviser 
under the gramm leach bliley act  which is discussed in more detail below  a bank holding company that satisfies certain criteria may elect to become a financial holding company and engage in a broader range of activities 
with some limited exceptions  the bank holding company act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before acquiring substantially all the assets of any bank  acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition it would own or control more than of the voting shares of such bank unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares  or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company 
in addition  and subject to some exceptions  the bank holding company act and the change in bank control act  together with their regulations  require federal reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring control of a bank holding company 
control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company 
control is rebuttably presumed to exist if a person acquires or more  but less than  of any class of voting securities and if the institution has registered securities under section of the securities exchange act of or no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction 
the regulations provide a procedure for challenging this rebuttable control presumption 
gramm leach bliley act 
the gramm leach bliley act of was signed into law on november  the glba covers a broad range of issues  including a repeal of most of the restrictions on affiliations among depository institutions  securities firms and insurance companies 
the following description summarizes some of its significant provisions 
the glba repeals sections and of the glass steagall act  thus permitting unrestricted affiliations between banks and securities firms 
it also permits bank holding companies to elect to become financial holding companies 
a financial holding company may engage in or acquire companies that engage in a broad range of financial services  including securities activities such as underwriting  dealing  investment  merchant banking  insurance underwriting  sales and brokerage activities 
in order to become a financial holding company  the bank holding company and all of its affiliated depository institutions must be well capitalized  well managed and have at least a satisfactory community reinvestment act rating 
we became a financial holding company after the mou was lifted in april the glba provides that the states continue to have the authority to regulate insurance activities  but prohibits the states in most instances from preventing or significantly interfering with the ability of a bank  directly or through an affiliate  to engage in insurance sales  solicitations or cross marketing activities 
although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner  the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in specific areas identified under the law 
under the new law  the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted insurance consumer protection regulations that apply to sales practices  solicitations  advertising and disclosures 
the glba adopts a system of functional regulation under which the federal reserve board is designated as the umbrella regulator for financial holding companies  but financial holding company affiliates are principally regulated by functional regulators such as the occ for national bank affiliates  the securities and exchange commission for securities affiliates  and state insurance regulators for insurance affiliates 
it repeals the broad exemption of banks from the definitions of broker and dealer for purposes of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
it also identifies a set of specific activities  including traditional bank trust and fiduciary 
table of contents activities  in which a bank may engage without being deemed a broker  and a set of activities in which a bank may engage without being deemed a dealer 
additionally  the law makes conforming changes in the definitions of broker and dealer for purposes of the investment company act of  as amended  and the investment advisers act of  as amended 
the glba contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions 
under these provisions  a financial institution must provide to its customers  both at the inception of the customer relationship and on an annual basis  the institution s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers nonpublic personal financial information 
the law provides that  except for specific limited exceptions  an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure 
an institution may not disclose to a non affiliated third party  other than to a consumer reporting agency  customer account numbers or other similar account identifiers for marketing purposes 
the glba also provides that the states may adopt customer privacy protections that are more strict than those contained in the act 
payment of dividends 
we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries 
virtually all of our revenues will result from dividends paid to us by our bank subsidiary  millennium bank 
our bank subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends that it can pay 
under the national bank act  a national bank may not declare a dividend in excess of its undivided profits  which means that millennium bank must recover any accumulated losses before it may pay a dividend to us 
additionally  millennium bank may not declare a dividend to us if the total amount of all dividends  including the proposed dividend  declared by it in any calendar year exceeds the total of its retained net income of that year to date  combined with its retained net income of the two preceding years  unless the dividend is approved by the occ 
millennium bank may not declare or pay any dividend if  after making the dividend  the national bank would be undercapitalized  as defined in the federal regulations 
both the occ and the fdic have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by national banks and insured banks if the payment is deemed an unsafe and unsound practice 
both the occ and the fdic have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsound and unsafe banking practice 
in addition  we are subject to certain regulatory requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums 
these regulatory requirements regarding capital affect our dividend policies 
the federal reserve has indicated that a bank holding company  generally  should pay dividends only if its net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends  and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
virginia law also imposes some restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities below for more information on these restrictions 
insurance of accounts  assessments and regulation by the fdic 
the deposits of our bank subsidiary are insured by the fdic up to the limits set forth under applicable law 
the deposits of our bank subsidiary are subject to the deposit insurance assessments of the deposit insurance fund  or dif  of the fdic 
the dif is the successor to the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund  which were merged in the fdic modified its risk based deposit insurance assessment system under authority granted by the federal deposit insurance reform act of under the revised system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on regulatory capital levels  supervisory evaluations  and certain other factors 
under the new rules  all insured depository institutions will pay deposit insurance premiums  currently ranging between and basis points on an institution s assessment base for institutions in risk category  the healthiest institutions  to basis points on an institution s assessment base for the riskiest institutions 
these rates may be adjusted uniformly from one quarter to the next  except that no single adjustment can exceed basis points 
in addition to being influenced by the risk profile of the particular depository institution  fdic premiums are also influenced by the size of the fdic insurance fund in relation to the designated reserve ratio range 
if the reserve ratio falls below percent  or is expected to within months  the fdic must adopt a restoration plan that provides that the dif will return to percent within years 
if the reserve ratio exceeds  the fdic may pay dividends to insured institutions 

table of contents the fdic is authorized to prohibit any dif insured institution from engaging in any activity that the fdic determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the insurance fund 
also  the fdic may initiate enforcement actions against banks  after first giving the institution s primary regulatory authority an opportunity to take such action 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any depository institution if it determines  after a hearing  that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order or any condition imposed in writing by the fdic 
it also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance  if the institution has no tangible capital 
if deposit insurance is terminated  the deposits at the institution at the time of termination  less subsequent withdrawals  shall continue to be insured for a period from six months to two years  as determined by the fdic 
we are not aware of any existing circumstances that could result in termination of any of our bank subsidiary s deposit insurance 
capital requirements 
each of the occ and the federal reserve board has issued risk based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to banking organizations that it supervise 
under the risk based capital requirements  we and our bank subsidiary are each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including specific off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit of 
at least half of the total capital must be composed of tier capital  which is defined as common equity  retained earnings  qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interest in common equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less certain intangibles 
the remainder may consist of tier capital  which is defined as specific subordinated debt  some hybrid capital instruments and other qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the loan loss allowance and pretax net unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities 
in addition  each of the federal banking regulatory agencies has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banking organizations 
under these requirements  banking organizations must maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to adjusted average quarterly assets equal to to  subject to federal bank regulatory evaluation of an organization s overall safety and soundness 
in sum  the capital measures used by the federal banking regulators are the total risk based capital ratio  which is the total of tier risk based capital and tier capital  the tier risk based capital ratio  and the leverage ratio 
under these regulations  a national bank will be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to any written agreement  order  capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive by a federal bank regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater or in certain circumstances and is not well capitalized  undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or in certain circumstances  or a leverage ratio of less than or in certain circumstances 
significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  or critically undercapitalized if its tangible equity is equal to or less than of tangible assets 
the risk based capital standards of each of the occ and the federal reserve board explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non traditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage these risks  as important factors to be taken into account by the agency in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy 
the capital guidelines also provide that an institution s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organization s capital adequacy 

table of contents the occ and the fdic may take various corrective actions against any undercapitalized bank and any bank that fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement a plan accepted by the occ or the fdic 
these powers include  but are not limited to  requiring the institution to add capital  prohibiting asset growth  restricting interest rates paid  requiring prior approval of capital distributions by any bank holding company that controls the institution  requiring divestiture by the institution of its subsidiaries or by the holding company of the institution itself  requiring new election of directors  and requiring the dismissal of directors and officers 
our bank subsidiary presently maintains sufficient capital to remain in compliance with these capital requirements 
other safety and soundness regulations 
there are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the fdic insurance fund in the event that the depository institution is insolvent or is in danger of becoming insolvent 
these obligations and restrictions are not for the benefit of investors 
regulators may pursue an administrative action against any bank holding company or national bank  which violates the law  engages in an unsafe or unsound banking practice or which is about to engage in an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the administrative action could take the form of a cease and desist proceeding  a removal action against the responsible individuals or  in the case of a violation of law or unsafe and unsound banking practice  a civil money penalty action 
a cease and desist order  in addition to prohibiting certain action  could also require that certain action be undertaken 
under the policies of the federal reserve board  we are required to serve as a source of financial strength to our subsidiary depository institution and to commit resources to support the bank in circumstances where we might not do so otherwise 
interstate banking and branching 
current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic limitation 
effective june   a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state  as long as neither of the states had opted out of such interstate merger authority prior to such date 
for example  as a bank headquartered in virginia  we may acquire a bank in maryland  but we cannot simply establish a branch in maryland 
after a bank has acquired a branch in a state through an interstate merger transaction  the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a bank headquartered in that state could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law 
monetary policy 
the commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary policies of the federal reserve board 
the instruments of monetary policy employed by the federal reserve board include open market operations in united states government securities  changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing and changes in reserve requirements against deposits held by all federally insured banks 
the federal reserve board s monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
in view of changing conditions in the national and international economy and in the money markets  as well as the effect of actions by monetary fiscal authorities  including the federal reserve board  no prediction can be made as to possible future changes in interest rates  deposit levels  loan demand or the business and earnings of our bank subsidiary 
federal reserve system 
in  congress enacted legislation that imposed reserve requirements on all depository institutions that maintain transaction accounts or nonpersonal time deposits 
now accounts  money market deposit accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to these reserve requirements  as are any nonpersonal time deposits at an institution 
for net transaction accounts in  the first million will be exempt from reserve requirements 
a reserve ratio will be assessed on net transaction accounts over million up to and including million 
a reserve ratio will be applied to amounts in net transaction accounts in excess of million 
these percentages are subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a non interest bearing account at  or on behalf of  a federal reserve bank  the effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the institution s interest earning assets 
transactions with affiliates 
transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act and the federal reserve board s regulation w 
an affiliate of a bank is any bank or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with such bank 
generally  section a 
table of contents i limits the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such institution s capital stock and surplus  and maintain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital stock and surplus  and ii requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable  to the bank as those provided to a nonaffiliate 
the term covered transaction includes the making of loans  purchase of assets  issuance of a guarantee and similar other types of transactions 
section b applies to covered transaction as well as sales of assets and payments of money to an affiliate 
these transactions must also be conducted on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable  to the bank as those provided to nonaffiliates 
loans to insiders 
the federal reserve act and related regulations impose specific restrictions on loans to directors  executive officers and principal shareholders of banks 
under section h of the federal reserve act and the federal reserve board s regulation o  any loan to a director  an executive officer and to a principal shareholder of a bank  and to entities controlled by any of the foregoing  may not exceed  together with all other outstanding loans to such person and the entities controlled by such person  the bank s loan to one borrower limit 
loans in the aggregate to insiders and their related interests as a class may not exceed two times the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus until the bank s total assets equal or exceed  at which time the aggregate is limited to the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
section h also prohibits loans  above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency  to directors  executive officers and principal shareholders of a bank or bank holding company  and to entities controlled by such persons  unless such loans are approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank with any interested director not participating in the voting 
for millennium bank  the loan amount  which includes all other outstanding loans to such person  as to which such prior board of director approval is required  is the greater of  or of capital and surplus up to 
section h requires that loans to directors  executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms and underwriting standards substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons 
community reinvestment act 
under the community reinvestment act and related regulations  depository institutions have an affirmative obligation to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas  including low and moderate income areas  consistent with safe and sound banking practice 
the community reinvestment act requires the adoption by each institution of a community reinvestment act statement for each of its market areas describing the depository institution s efforts to assist in its community s credit needs 
depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the community reinvestment act and are periodically assigned ratings in this regard 
banking regulators consider a depository institution s community reinvestment act rating when reviewing applications to establish new branches  undertake new lines of business  and or acquire part or all of another depository institution 
an unsatisfactory rating can significantly delay or even prohibit regulatory approval of a proposed transaction by a bank holding company or its depository institution subsidiaries 
the gramm leach bliley act and federal bank regulators have made various changes to the community reinvestment act 
among other changes  community reinvestment act agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual reports must be made to a bank s primary federal regulator 
a bank holding company will not be permitted to become a financial holding company and no activities authorized under the glba may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a satisfactory rating in its latest community reinvestment act examination 
fair lending  consumer laws 
in addition to the community reinvestment act  other federal and state laws regulate various lending and consumer aspects of the banking business 
governmental agencies  including the department of housing and urban development  the federal trade commission and the department of justice  have become concerned that prospective borrowers experience discrimination in their efforts to obtain loans from depository and other lending institutions 
these agencies have brought litigation against depository institutions alleging discrimination against borrowers 
many of these suits have been settled  in some cases for material sums  short of a full trial 
recently  these governmental agencies have clarified what they consider to be lending discrimination and have specified various factors that they will use to determine the existence of lending discrimination under the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act  including evidence that a lender discriminated on a prohibited basis  evidence that a lender treated applicants differently based on prohibited factors in the absence of evidence that the treatment was the result of prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate  and evidence that a lender applied an otherwise neutral non discriminatory policy uniformly to all applicants  but the practice had a discriminatory effect  unless the practice could be justified as a business necessity 

table of contents banks and other depository institutions also are subject to numerous consumer oriented laws and regulations 
these laws  which include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the electronic funds transfer act  the equal credit opportunity act  and the fair housing act  require compliance by depository institutions with various disclosure requirements and requirements regulating the availability of funds after deposit or the making of some loans to customers 
usa patriot act of in october  the usa patriot act of was enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc  which occurred on september  the patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and the intelligence communities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts 
the potential impact of the patriot act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging 
the patriot act contains sweeping anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and imposes various regulations  including standards for verifying client identification at account opening  and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering 
future regulatory uncertainty because federal regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate  we cannot forecast how federal regulation of financial institutions may change in the future and impact our operations 
although congress in recent years has sought to reduce the regulatory burden on financial institutions with respect to the approval of specific transactions  we fully expect that the financial institution industry will remain heavily regulated in the near future and that additional laws or regulations may be adopted further regulating specific banking practices 
item a 
risk factors risks associated with millennium wind down of mortgage operations and subsequent disposition of remaining held for sale loans and repurchase obligations could result in additional losses over and above amounts already reserved 
we determined that it was in our best interest to wind down our mortgage operating subsidiaries as of december  due  in part  to credit quality issues that surfaced in the subprime sector of our held for sale portfolio during the fourth quarter the subprime sector of the held for sale portfolio included loans that carried a higher level of risk because the loans were made to individuals who would not otherwise qualify for traditional loan products 
at year end we established reserves of million associated with the remaining loans held for sale from these operations and reserves of million associated with potential repurchase exposure on loans already sold to investors 
while management believes it has isolated and identified its loss exposure at december   there is inherent imprecision in the estimation of losses and therefore there can be no assurance that additional reserves may not be required in future periods 
the effects of an economic slowdown  continued softness in the housing market  rising interest rates and events that affect specifically the geographic areas in which the loans are made are all factors that could increase the loss exposure and could result in additional losses reflected in the operating results of future periods 
failure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure control could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our reputation and operating results would be harmed 
as part of our ongoing monitoring of internal control we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control as defined under standards adopted by the public company accounting oversight board that require remediation 
as of december   we determined that it was in our best interest to wind down our mortgage operating subsidiaries 
it was our desire to focus exclusively on core banking activities going forward to eliminate  going forward  the risks normally associated with mortgage banking activities 
the wind down decision was also precipitated by credit quality issues that surfaced in the held for sale loan portfolio during the fourth quarter 
as a result  in connection with the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december   we determined that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of that date arising from our inability to identify promptly these credit quality issues 
under the pcaob standards  a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
we have provided additional information on this material weakness  including our remediation of it  in item a 
controls and procedures of this report on form k 
we cannot make any assurances that other internal or disclosure control deficiencies might not be identified 
any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could  among other things  result in losses from fraud or error  harm our reputation or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
a large percentage of our loans are secured by real estate  and an adverse change in the real estate market may result in losses and adversely affect our profitability 
approximately of our loan portfolio  as of december  was comprised of loans secured by real estate 
in addition  loans held for sale of million at december  consist of loans secured by residential real estate 
an adverse change in the economy affecting values of real estate generally or in our market areas specifically could impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
in the event of a default with respect to any of these loans  the amounts we receive upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest on the loan 
as a result  our profitability and financial condition could be negatively impacted by an adverse change in the real estate market 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of our senior executive officers or other key employees could impair our relationship with our customers and adversely affect our business and financial results on april  we announced the hiring of richard i 
linhart to succeed carroll c 
markley as president and chief executive officer 
mr 
linhart previously served as senior executive vice president and chief operating officer for james monroe bancorp 
he is expected to join us in mid july dale g 
phelps  our chief financial officer  was appointed to an interim role as president and chief executive officer until mr 
linhart s arrival 
mr 
phelps has over years of experience in the financial services industry 
concurrently  john f 
novak was appointed to serve as chief operating officer until mr 
linhart s arrival 
mr 
novak has over years of experience in the financial services industry 
our success is dependent upon the continued service and skills of these individuals as well as other senior officers 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these key personnel could have an adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our market  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 

table of contents our business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and capital levels 
the majority of our assets are monetary in nature and  as a result  we are subject to significant risk from changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates can impact our net interest income as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities 
our earnings are significantly dependent on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
in either event  if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap will work against us and our earnings may be negatively affected 
an increase in the general level of interest rates may also  among other things  reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans 
conversely  a decrease in the general level of interest rates  among other things  may lead to an increase in prepayments on our loans and increased competition for deposits 
accordingly  changes in the general level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest earning assets  loan origination volume  loan portfolios and our overall results 
although our asset liability management strategy is designed to control our risk from changes in the general level of market interest rates  market interest rates are affected by many factors outside of our control  including inflation  recession  changes in unemployment  money supply and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets 
it is quite possible that significant changes in interest rates may take place in the future  and we cannot always accurately predict the nature or magnitude of such changes or how such changes may affect our business 
market conditions may adversely affect our ability to continue to rely on brokered deposits as a source of funds and cause us to seek alternative sources that may not be on terms favorable to us 
we solicit deposits from brokers because our banking offices do not attract enough deposits to fund all of the loans that we make 
these brokered deposits represent funds that brokers gather from third parties and package in batches in order to find higher interest rates than are typically available for certificates of deposits with large balances  as compared to individually deposited smaller denomination deposits 
deposit holders then earn a higher rate on the money that they have invested  and the broker charges a fee for its service 
brokered deposits are available in bulk  and they do not require any investments in branch offices or branch personnel or spending for marketing or education of employees 
at december   million of our deposits were brokered deposits 
the weighted average interest rate on our brokered deposits was at december  brokered deposits are normally more costly than traditional core deposits  as they carry a higher blended interest rate 
if market conditions change  brokers may transfer deposited funds from us into other investments or demand higher interest rates for new deposits 
moreover  brokers operate in a national market and will place funds with banks that offer to pay the highest interest rates 
unlike businesses and individuals who bank with us in our market  there is no basis for a business relationship with deposit brokers that would provide a stable deposit base 
there is a higher likelihood that  unlike deposits from our local customers  the funds that brokered deposits provide us will not remain with us after maturity 
we could be confronted with the choice of curtailing our lending activity or paying above market interest rates in order to attract and retain deposits 
either action could reduce our net income 
any inability to keep our deposit growth on pace with the growth in our loan portfolio may affect our net income 
in this situation  we may need to obtain alternative sources of funding  which may or may not be available to us on terms that we would consider favorable 
government regulations may adversely affect our ability to continue to rely on brokered deposits as a source of funds and cause us to curtail our mortgage banking business 
federal deposit insurance corporation regulations could affect our ability to continue to accept brokered deposits 
a well capitalized bank one that significantly exceeds specified capital ratios may accept brokered deposits without restriction 
undercapitalized banks those that fail to meet minimum regulatory capital 
table of contents requirements may not accept brokered deposits  and adequately capitalized banks those that are not well capitalized or undercapitalized may only accept such deposits with the consent of the fdic 
millennium bank currently is well capitalized and  therefore  may accept brokered deposits without restriction 
if  as a result of rapid asset growth or unanticipated losses  millennium bank ceased to be well capitalized  the fdic might not permit it to maintain its desired level of brokered deposits 
if it were required to reduce its level of brokered deposits  millennium bank also would have to reduce its assets and  most likely  curtail its mortgage banking business 
any reduction could have an adverse effect on our revenues 
our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the geographic markets in which we operate 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the northern virginia and richmond  virginia area 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on our commercial  real estate and construction loans  the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities  unemployment or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and negatively affect our financial results 
we could be subject to environmental risks and associated costs on our foreclosed real estate assets 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
there is a risk that hazardous or toxic waste could be found on the properties that secure our loans 
if we acquire such properties as a result of foreclosure  we could be held responsible for the cost of cleaning up or removing this waste  and this cost could exceed the value of the underlying properties and adversely affect our profitability 
although we have policies and procedures that require us to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  which could adversely affect our earnings 
we are exposed to the risk that our loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate the bank for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral 
we may experience significant loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the diversification by industry of our commercial loan portfolio  the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values  the results of recent regulatory examinations  the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  the amount of charge offs for the period  the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security  and the evaluation of our loan portfolio by the external loan review 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
additional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have experienced to date 
in determining the size of the allowance  we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio  our experience and our evaluation of general economic conditions 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our current allowance may not be sufficient and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio 
material additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of our management 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our small to medium sized business target market may have fewer financial resources to weather a downturn in the economy 
we target our business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small to medium sized businesses 
these small to medium sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
if general economic conditions negatively impact the central and northern virginia area or the other markets in which we operate  our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected 
an interruption in or breach in security of our information systems may result in a loss of customer business 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure or interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposits  servicing or loan origination systems 
we cannot assure you that such failures or interruptions will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed by us 
the occurrence of any failures or interruptions could result in a loss of customer business and have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our growth strategy may not be successful  and that could have an adverse effect on the value of your common stock 
our business strategy calls for us to take advantage of our existing investments in facilities and personnel by growing in our existing banking market and expanding into new markets if appropriate opportunities arise 
we may not be successful in increasing the volume of our loans and deposits at acceptable risk levels and on acceptable terms  in expanding our asset base to a targeted size  or in managing the costs and implementation risks associated with our growth strategy 
even if we successfully increase our capital  increasing the volume of our loans will require that we be able to fund that increase through additional deposits we accept in our market or through brokers  or through other funding sources  such as borrowings 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain capital sufficient to support our continued growth and may not be able to fund any particular amount of increase in our loans 
if we need additional capital in the future  we may not be able to obtain it on terms that are favorable  which may limit our growth 
we anticipate that we will support our growth strategy through additional deposits at new branch locations and investment opportunities 
it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to support our future growth 
our ability to raise capital through borrowings or the sale of securities will depend primarily upon our financial condition and the conditions of financial markets at the time 
we cannot make any assurance that additional capital would be available on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
the failure to raise additional capital on terms that are favorable to us or at all may force us to limit our growth strategy 
risks associated with our industry we face strong competition from other financial institutions and financial service companies  which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we face vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions  including savings and loan associations  savings banks  finance companies and credit unions 
a number of these banks and other financial institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits  larger branch systems and a wider array of banking services than we do 
we also compete with other providers of financial services  such as money market mutual funds  brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  insurance companies and governmental organizations  each of which may offer more favorable financing than we are able to provide 
some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services  reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we operate in a highly regulated environment and  as a result  are subject to extensive regulation and supervision that could adversely affect our financial performance  and we may be adversely affected by changes in federal and local laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities 
any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on us  our subsidiaries  and our operations 
additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers  authority and operations  or the powers  authority and operations of millennium bank  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties 
the exercise of this regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on us

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general millennium bankshares corporation is a bank holding company headquartered in reston  virginia 
we were incorporated in and began operations in april we provide services through our principal operating subsidiary  millennium bank 
we presently operate seven banking offices  all in virginia 
two offices are in reston  one each is in great falls  herndon  and warrenton  and two are in the richmond  virginia area 
we also have a loan production office located in fredericksburg  virginia 
we are a community bank providing a broad range of commercial and retail banking services designed to meet the needs of businesses and consumers in the communities we serve 
we emphasize local decision making within our organization and provide personal service to our customers 
by combining the technological support  products and services that our customers demand with direct access to senior management and responsive customer service  we work to foster a business and consumer banking environment that allows us to effectively compete in our particular market with other financial institutions of all sizes 
our operating revenues are derived primarily from interest earned on loans and investment securities portfolio net of interest paid on deposit products and borrowings 
millennium also receives revenue from sales of small business administration loans and fee income from loans  deposits and other banking products 
millennium continues to seek and evaluate additional expansion alternatives either through loan production offices or new branch locations 
the new branch locations can be a prior branch location purchased from an existing institution or a de novo site determined to best suit our strategic plans 
in addition  we intend to consider various strategic acquisitions of banks  banking assets or financial service entities related to banking in our geographical areas that management believes would complement and increase our existing business lines  or expansion into new market areas or product lines that management determines would be in the best interest of millennium and its shareholders 
as of december   we determined that it was in our best interest to wind down our mortgage operating subsidiaries 
it was our desire to focus exclusively on core banking activities going forward to eliminate  going forward  the risks normally associated with mortgage banking activities 
the wind down decision was also precipitated by credit quality issues that surfaced in the held for sale loan portfolio during the fourth quarter 
accordingly  the results of our mortgage operations are presented in a separate category on the income statement following the results from continuing operations 
as a result of charges in excess of million that were recorded in conjunction with the wind down of mortgage operations  we reported a net loss of million for the quarter ended december  and a net loss of  for the year ended december  the following presents management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition at december  and and the results of our operations for the years ended december   and the discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this form k 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
see also note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents allowance for loan losses millennium monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
millennium maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of control over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
millennium evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  millennium makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of millennium as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses exceeds the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses were below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
millennium recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
financial summary for the year ended december   millennium reported income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  compared to income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share for the same period in as a result of charges in excess of million that were recorded in conjunction with the wind down of mortgage operations  we reported a net loss of million for the quarter ended december  and a net loss of  for the year 
further information regarding discontinued operations can be found under the subheading discontinued operations within this item 

table of contents a significant focus in was centered on the acquisition of albemarle first bank  charlottesville  virginia 
this acquisition  however  was terminated on november  due to our failure to receive requisite shareholder approval 
income from continuing operations for the year ended was negatively impacted by after tax charges of thousand related to writing off transaction costs associated with the terminated acquisition 
in  millennium also incurred after tax securities losses of thousand in a transaction designed to improve the investment portfolio risk profile 
total assets increased to million at december   compared to million at december   representing an increase of million or 
loans including loans held for sale  net of allowance for loan losses at december  were million  an increase of million from the december  balance of million 
loans held for sale increased million while the bank s portfolio increased by million 
the investment portfolio increased by million at december  as compared to the prior year ended december  the increase was reflected primarily in two sectors states and political subdivisions and mortgage backed securities  as millennium sought to improve portfolio diversification and the overall risk profile 
total deposits reached million at december   a million increase over the prior year end with the bulk of the increase in total deposits reflected in time deposits 
shareholders equity was million at december  compared with million at december  book value per share was at december  and at december  net interest income net interest income is the largest component of our earnings and is equal to the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense 
interest earning assets consist primarily of loans and securities  while deposits and borrowings represent the major portion of interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  as well as changes in the yields and rates paid  determine changes in net interest income 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis attributable to continuing operations was million in  million in and million in net interest income from discontinued operations was  in   in and  in the net interest income from discontinued operations is attributable to average loans held for sale which is included in the table that follows in loans 
as reflected in the following table  net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in interest income for the year ended december  was million  up from million for the same period last year 
the interest income increase was attributable to an increase in average earning assets coupled with an basis point increase in gross yield 
of the million increase in interest income  million was attributable to volume and million was attributable to rate changes 
growth in interest income would have been more pronounced except that the composition of average earning assets shifted to a higher percentage of investment securities 
additional funds were deployed in the investment portfolio to reduce the overall interest rate exposure in a declining rate scenario 
loan yield increased basis points as existing variable rate loans tied to prime repriced upward concurrent with the continuing tightening of short term rates by the federal open market committee  which tends to cause increases in the prime rate  and as new volume was originated in a rising rate environment 
average loans increased while average securities increased 
interest expense increased million as the average balance of deposits and borrowed funds increased as well as the rates paid thereon 
most of the increased funding for earning assets was concentrated in higher rate certificates of deposit  the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased in greater magnitude than earning asset yield 
the increase in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities was also influenced by intense competition  the implementation of a more aggressive deposit pricing strategy and the negative effects of the inverted yield curve 
funding of earning assets from interest free sources also declined from for the year ended december  to for the same period this year 
millennium is continuing its focus in on deposit initiatives designed to generate higher volumes of lower cost demand and transaction accounts 
the net interest margin decreased by basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in

december  dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction within year variable rate to years after years total fixed rate to years after years total total maturities asset quality general asset quality is an important factor in the successful operation of a financial institution 
banking regulations require institutions to classify their assets and to establish prudent general allowances for losses for assets classified as substandard or doubtful 
for the portion of assets classified as loss  an institution is required to either establish specific allowances of of the amount classified or charge such amounts off its books 
assets which do not currently expose millennium to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess potential weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention by management 
these loans are monitored closely so that we can mitigate our exposure to further deterioration in the asset 
millennium charges off any loans that are classified as loss 
unless well secured and in the process of collection  millennium places loans in a non accrual status once they become past due greater than days  or earlier in situations in which the loans have developed inherent problems that indicate payment of principal and interest may not be made in full 
whenever the accrual of interest is stopped  previously accrued but uncollected interest income is reversed 
thereafter  interest is recognized only as cash is received 
the loan is reinstated to an accrual basis after it has been brought current as to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan

these notifications obligate us to repurchase the loans in accordance with the terms of investor agreements 
as a result  the balance of nonperforming assets is expected to increase by approximately million in management has assigned an internal team of qualified professionals to handle the workout of these loans 
we have recorded loss reserves of million at year end for these loans which we believe are adequate to absorb any potential loss

delinquent and problem loans when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  millennium attempts to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower 
a notice is mailed to the borrower after a payment is days past due and again when the loan is days past due 
for most loans  if the delinquency is not cured within days  millennium issues a notice of intent to foreclose on the property and if the delinquency is not cured within days  millennium may institute foreclosure action 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly 

table of contents allowance for losses on loans millennium provides valuation allowances for probable losses incurred on loans when we determine that a significant decline in the value of the collateral has occurred  and if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of the unpaid principal of the related loan plus estimated costs of acquisition and sale 
in addition  millennium also provides reserves based on the dollar amount and type of collateral securing its loans  in order to protect against unanticipated losses 
a loss experience percentage is established for each loan type and is reviewed at least annually  and more frequently if we identify factors that require us to consider a change to the percentage 
each month  the loss percentage is applied to the portfolio  by product type  to determine the minimum amount of reserves required 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations  future adjustments to reserves may be necessary  and net income could be significantly affected  if circumstances differ substantially from assumptions used in making the initial determinations 
an analysis of the allowance for loan losses  including charge off activity  is presented below for the periods indicated 
net recoveries of  were experienced in versus net charge offs of  in and accordingly  the provision for loan loss expense was lower than in also in  the provision for loan loss expense was influenced by a revision to revised qualitative factors utilized in the allowance methodology

the benefit from the staffing reduction was partially offset by  in stock compensation expense recognized in in accordance with adoption of fas r 
most other categories of expense also declined in compared with coincident with management s focus on cost savings and efficiency

discontinued operations as of december   we determined that it was in our best interest to wind down our mortgage operating subsidiaries 
it was our desire to focus exclusively on core banking activities going forward to eliminate  the risks normally associated with mortgage banking activities 
the wind down decision was also precipitated by credit quality issues that surfaced in the subprime sector of the held for sale loan portfolio during the fourth quarter 
the subprime sector of the held for sale portfolio included loans that carried a higher level of inherent risk because the loans were made to individuals who would otherwise not qualify for traditional loan products accordingly  the results our mortgage operations are presented in a separate category on the income statement following the results from continuing operations 
the components of discontinued operations are reflected in the table that follows 

table of contents statement of income for discontinued operations interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses noninterest income gain loss on sale of loans and loan fees  net other income total noninterest income noninterest expense officers and employees compensation and benefits occupancy and equipment expense marketing  promotion and advertising expense other operating expense total noninterest expense income loss from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from discontinued operations in september  we restructured mortgage operations 
prior to september  we recorded gross gains on mortgage sales  which were offset by compensation expense and other direct expenses for the mortgage department 
beginning in  prior periods were restated to reflect a net gain presentation gross gains on mortgage sales netted with compensation cost 
under the new structure we established in september  contractual relationships with three mortgage banking limited liability companies  the terms of each of which provided for a per loan fee to be paid to us  the owner of the llc s for each mortgage loan sold and required the owners to pay for all costs of operation while retaining all other fee income 
at december  there were million in loans held for sale attributable to discontinued operations 
included in the carrying amount for loans held for sale was a million lower of cost or market adjustment 
the expense associated with this adjustment is reflected as a contra revenue item in gain on sale of loans  net 
the amount reflected in other loan expense for in the following table is a charge to establish a million reserve for potential off balance sheet exposure associated with loans already sold to investors 
investor agreements provide that the seller must buyback the loan under certain conditions  such as early payment default  and management determined at december  that it was more likely than not that buyback conditions occurred in some of the production sold to investors  particularly for identified loans that were originated under sub prime underwriting guidelines 

table of contents other operating expenses consist of the following dues and fees franchise taxes and miscellaneous taxes insurance expense meetings and seminar expense miscellaneous operating expenses office expenses outside services professional fees other loan expense total other operating expenses sources of funds deposits deposits have been the principal source of millennium s funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes 
at present  millennium has employed alternative methods to gather deposits to fund our mortgage loan operations and commercial lending 
alternative methods used are advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta for daily and longer term borrowings and also brokered deposits 
brokered deposits are deposits that we obtain through brokers for a fee 
brokered deposits are available in bulk  and they do not require any investments in branch offices  branch personnel or additional spending for marketing or education of employees 
the brokered deposits that we obtain consist primarily of jumbo day to year certificates of deposits 
brokered deposits often earn a rate of interest that is higher than the rates we pay on other deposit products  which increases millennium s overall cost of funds and decreases our net interest margin 
in addition to deposits  millennium derives funds from loan repayments  cash flows generated from operations  which includes interest credited to deposit accounts  repurchase agreements entered into with commercial banks and federal home loan bank of atlanta advances 
borrowings may be used to compensate for reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels and have been used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities 
millennium attracts both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide assortment of accounts and rates 
millennium offers statement savings accounts  various checking accounts  various money market accounts  fixed rate certificates with varying maturities  and individual retirement accounts and is expanding to provide deposit products and services for businesses 
millennium s principal use of deposits is to originate loans and fund investment securities 
at december   deposits were million  an increase of from million at december  the increase in deposits was most heavily concentrated in certificates of deposit  the result of a highly successful promotion 
this influx of certificates of deposit  while a more expensive funding source than other retail products  provides cross sell opportunities 
raising low cost deposits continues to be a challenge in our marketplace  which has been further exacerbated by the inverted yield curve 
the decline in savings account balances from december  reflects a customer preference for the higher yielding short term certificates of deposit 
the deposit growth in other categories is a reflection of branch office growth  aggressive pricing  marketing and other bank consolidation in millennium s principal market 
in order to reduce the overall cost of funds and reduce our reliance on high cost time deposits and short term borrowings as a funding source  we continue to direct extensive marketing efforts towards attracting lower cost transaction accounts  however  there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful  or if successful  that they will reduce our reliance on time deposits and short term borrowings

cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to assure that adequate liquidity is provided 
as a result of millennium s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through increasing deposits  management believes that millennium maintains overall liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs 
millennium s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  and amortization  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans and investments  and loan sales 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
excess funds are invested in overnight deposits to fund cash requirements experienced in the normal course of business 
millennium has been able to generate sufficient cash through its deposits as well as borrowings

in  this change was primarily a result of an increase of approximately million in deposits 
this increase was partially offset by an approximate million decrease in fhlb borrowings 
in  this change was mainly attributable to an increase in deposits of million and a million increase in fhlb borrowings 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in federal funds purchased 
millennium uses its sources of funds primarily to meet operating needs  to pay deposit withdrawals and fund loan commitments 
at december  and december  total approved loan commitments were million and million  respectively 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december   totaled million 
at december   we had a borrowing limit of million with the federal home loan bank 
our outstanding borrowings from the federal home loan bank totaled million at december   which leaves an additional borrowing capacity of million 
our borrowing limit is based on of bank assets at each quarter end date 
we also have two lines of credit with the community bankers bank in virginia in the amounts of million secured and million unsecured 
our outstanding borrowings from the community bankers bank were at december   leaving remaining available lines of credit of million 
in addition  we have a million line and million lines of credit with the bankers bank and compass bank  respectively 
there were no borrowings outstanding against either of these lines at december  management intends to fund anticipated loan closings and operating needs through cash on hand  brokered deposits  proceeds from the sale of loans  cash generated from operations and anticipated increases in deposits 
current and anticipated marketing programs will be primarily targeted at the attraction of lower cost transaction accounts 
capital represents funds  earned or obtained  over which financial institutions can exercise greater control in comparison with deposits and borrowed funds 
the adequacy of millennium s capital is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis with reference to size  composition and quality of millennium s resources and consistent with regulatory requirements and industry standards 
management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will support anticipated asset growth and absorb any potential losses

off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our off balance sheet arrangements 
maturity by period december  in thousands less than year greater than year to years greater than years to years greater than years total standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit mortgage banking commitments rate lock commitments standby letters of credit represent commitments by us to repay a third party beneficiary when a customer fails to repay a loan or debt instrument 
the terms and risk of loss involved in issuing standby letters of credit are similar to those involved in issuing loan commitments and extending credit 
in addition to credit risk  we also have liquidity risk associated with stand by letters of credit because funding for these obligations could be required immediately 

table of contents commitments to extend credit are loan commitments  which assure a borrower of financing for a specified period of time at a specified rate on a loan millennium intends to hold in its portfolio 
the risk to millennium under such commitments is limited to the terms of the contracts 
for example  millennium may not be obligated to advance funds if the customer s financial condition deteriorates or if the customer fails to meet specific covenants 
an approved loan commitment represents a potential credit risk once the funds are advanced to the customer 
this is also a liquidity risk since the customer may demand immediate cash that would require funding and interest rate risk as market interest rates may rise above the rate committed

these amounts have fixed maturity dates 
some of these borrowings  although fixed  are subject to conversion provisions at the option of the fhlb or millennium can prepay these advances without a penalty

impact of inflation and changing prices and seasonality the financial statements that are included in this document have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
millennium s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of millennium s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegated the responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco of the bank 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies that govern the company s asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
millennium uses two primary methods to evaluate market risk to changes in interest rates static gap analysis and simulation analysis 
static gap is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time interval measured at a balance sheet date 
the gap can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  by selling investments  by replacing an asset or liability prior to maturity  or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net income due to changes in market interest rates 
as reflected in the table below  millennium  at december   had million more in liabilities than assets that can reprice within one year or less and therefore we were in a liability sensitive position 
generally  a liability sensitive position is favorable to the bank in a decreasing rate environment and unfavorable to the bank in an increasing rate environment 
it is important to recognize that deposits with no stated maturity have been presented in this gap table in the months or less bucket because they can reprice in that time frame 
these deposits may not indeed reprice that quickly  however 

table of contents the following table presents the amounts of millennium s interest sensitive assets and liabilities that mature or reprice in the periods indicated  exclusive of non accrual loans 
december  maturing or repricing in months or less months years over years dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets loans investments federal funds sold total interest sensitive assets cumulative interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities now accounts savings money market deposit accounts certificates of deposit borrowed money total interest sensitive liabilities cumulative interest sensitive liabilities period gap cumulative gap ratio of cumulative interest sensitive assets to cumulative interest sensitive liabilities ratio of cumulative gap to total assets total assets includes mortgage loans held for sale 
excludes federal reserve  federal home loan bank  and community bankers bank stock 
anticipates prepayments on fnma and fhlmc pools 
contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual term of millennium s loan portfolio 
the average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and enforcement of due on sale clauses  which gives the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
in addition  certain borrowers increase their equity in the security property by making payments in excess of those required under the terms of the mortgage 
due to the inherent limitations of gap analysis  millennium utilizes simulation analysis as its primary tool for managing interest rate risk 
simulation analysis calculates expected net interest income under varying interest rate scenarios and the theoretical impact of immediate and sustained rate changes referred to as rate shocks 
this methodology is more sophisticated than the traditional gap analysis and more accurately reflects the impact on net interest income from embedded options in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
millennium places a higher degree of reliance on simulation modeling in its alco decision making process 
the simulation model is prepared and updated on a regular basis 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure of no more than 

table of contents the following reflects the results of millennium s net interest income sensitivity analysis at december  rate change estimated net interest income sensitivity bp no change bp at december   millennium s interest rate risk model indicated that  in a rising rate environment of basis points  net interest income would remain flat 
in the same time period the interest rate risk model indicated that in a declining rate environment of basis points  net interest income would decrease 
millennium s net interest income at risk is within policy limits 
management has been actively engaging in strategies to minimize the identified risk in the declining rate environment and anticipates the magnitude of sensitivity in the declining rate environment will continue to diminish in management also does not view the likelihood of a basis point decline in the near term as very probable but is nonetheless currently contemplating additional actions which can be taken to further minimize the identified risk in the declining rate environment 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels such as yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
in late  millennium changed the repricing assumption in the interest rate risk model such that offering rates on transactional deposits would move in tandem  both in magnitude and timing  with changes in market rates to more closely align the model to our current deposit pricing strategy while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  millennium cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in response to  or in anticipation of  changes in interest rates 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
millennium also performs economic value of equity modeling as a measurement tool 
the market value of equity measures the degree to which the market value of millennium s assets and liabilities will change given a change in interest rates 
the following table presents the economic value of equity shock analysis at december  change in yield curve in thousands change in economic value of equity basis points flat basis points
