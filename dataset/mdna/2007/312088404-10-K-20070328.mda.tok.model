item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a of part i and elsewhere in this report  our actual results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and other diseases of the immune system 
we have developed a proprietary technology that enables us to manufacture active immunotherapy products that are designed to stimulate a patient s immune system to mount a specific and sustained response to disease 
our lead product candidate  favid  is an active immunotherapy for the treatment of b cell non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl 
we initiated a pivotal phase clinical trial of favid in patients with follicular b cell nhl in july and completed patient enrollment in january with patients randomized into the trial 
in addition  favid has been evaluated in several multi center  open label phase clinical trials involving more than patients 
we believe favid may be effective in treating other types of b cell nhl 
four additional phase clinical trials of favid are ongoing 
one of these clinical trials is being conducted under a separate physician sponsored investigational new drug  or ind  application in the united states 
moreover  we believe our active immunotherapy expertise and proprietary manufacturing technology may enable us to develop additional product candidates for other oncology indications  such as t cell lymphoma  and for autoimmune diseases 
in june  we received an allowance from the fda for an ind for our second product candidate  fav  for the treatment of cutaneous t cell lymphoma 
we have retained exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to all of our product candidates 
we were incorporated in delaware in january as of december   we had not generated any revenues  and we had financed our operations and internal growth through private placements of our stock and warrants  equipment and leasehold debt financings and the sale of common stock in our initial public offering  or ipo  in february we are a development stage company and have incurred significant losses since our inception in  as we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development activities  including clinical trials 
as of december   our deficit accumulated during the development stage was approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we continue to develop and prepare for the commercialization of our lead product candidate  favid  expand our research and development programs  expand our current manufacturing capabilities to support commercial manufacturing of favid  and acquire or in license oncology products that are complementary to our own 
financial operations overview research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of costs associated with clinical trials of our product candidates  including the costs of manufacturing our product candidates  compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel  facilities costs and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on the development of favid 
we have completed enrollment in two phase clinical trials and continue to evaluate the results 
we initiated our pivotal phase clinical trial of favid following rituxan in patients with follicular b cell nhl in july and completed patient enrollment in the trial in january in addition  four additional phase clinical trials of favid are ongoing 
from inception through december   we incurred costs of approximately million associated with the research and development of favid  which represents substantially all of our research and development costs to date 
we expect our research and development costs to increase as we advance favid and new product candidates into later stages of clinical development 
while difficult to predict  we estimate that research and development costs required to complete the development of and file a biologics licensing application  or bla  for favid will be an additional million 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of other product candidates for commercialization 
on an ongoing basis  we expect to expand our research and development activities to include clinical development of fav and preclinical research of treatments for autoimmune diseases  initially multiple sclerosis 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
although we are currently focused primarily on favid  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct toward each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process  clinical trial completion dates and costs vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our product candidates could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be certain when  if ever  any cash flows from our current product candidates will commence 
marketing  general and administrative expense 
marketing  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other expenses related to our marketing and corporate administrative employees  legal fees and other professional services expenses 
we anticipate increases in marketing  general and administrative expenses as we add personnel and continue to develop and prepare for commercialization of our product candidates 
interest income 
interest income primarily consists of interest earned on our cash reserves  cash invested in money market funds  government securities  corporate notes and bonds and certificates of deposit 
interest expense 
interest expense represents interest on our debt  including capital leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r 
under sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we adopted the provisions of sfas r using a modified prospective application 
accordingly  prior periods have not been revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date  which are subsequently modified or cancelled 
estimated compensation expense for awards outstanding at the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value of the stock based compensation granted both before and after the adoption of sfas r 
the black scholes valuation model requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates  including estimates of the expected term participants will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations could have been significantly different than the amounts recorded 
under provisions of sfas r  we recorded approximately million of stock based compensation expense in our statement of operations for the year ended december  prior to the adoption of sfas r  we recorded approximately million and million of stock based compensation expense for certain options granted during and in our statement of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively  under the provisions of apb based upon their intrinsic value 
at december   the total compensation cost related to unvested stock based awards granted to employees under our stock award plans but not yet recognized was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures of approximately  this cost will be amortized on a straight line basis over a weighted average period of approximately years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures 
see note to the financial statements for further information on our accounting for stock based compensation 
lease obligation 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the reasonably assured lease term 
our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy 
we include any rent escalations and other rent holidays in our straight line rent expense 
in addition  tenant improvements paid by the landlord are capitalized as leasehold improvements and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term  while the tenant improvement allowance is recorded as deferred rent and recovered ratably over the remaining term of the lease 
capitalized software 
software developed for internal use  whether purchased or developed  is capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of five years 
costs incurred until the point the project has reached development stage are expensed in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
determining when a project has reached the development stage  requires the use of judgment 
subsequent additions  modifications or upgrades to internal use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform 
software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented above relating to them 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december  to research and development 
research and development expense increased from approximately million in to million in the increase of million  or  was due primarily to an increase of approximately million for the compensation costs of additional personnel and the merit bonus program  an increase of approximately  primarily due to the increased amortization of deferred rent associated with the amended long term lease agreements related to our facility expansion  an increase of approximately  to support our pivotal phase clinical trial and information technology outside services  clinical and regulatory third party consulting services to prepare for the commercialization of favid  and an increase of approximately  in stock based compensation costs due to the implementation of sfas r  offset by a decrease of approximately million of raw materials and supplies for the manufacture of favid due to the completion of patient enrollment into our pivotal phase clinical trial in the first quarter of and a decrease of approximately million in clinical trial site costs 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expense increased from approximately million in to million in the increase of million  or  primarily reflects an increase of approximately million in personnel and outside services related to strategic marketing programs  an increase of approximately  in compensation costs associated with additional administrative personnel  discretionary bonuses paid in and the merit bonus program  an increase of approximately  in stock based compensation due to the implementation of sfas r  and an increase of approximately  in legal and audit fees and other public company expenses 
interest income 
interest income increased from approximately million in to million in the increase of million  or  was primarily a result of rising interest rates during and the higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance of million available for investment during as compared to million in the higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is due to the addition of net proceeds of million from our private placement of common stock and warrants in march comparison of fiscal years ended december  to research and development 
research and development expense increased from approximately million in to million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in clinical trial site costs  an increase of million associated with an increase in personnel from employees to employees to support our phase clinical trial initiated in july  an increase of million associated with supplies to support continued process and formulation development and the purchase of raw materials and supplies for our manufacture of favid for our phase clinical trial  an increase of million paid to third party vendors providing support services for our phase clinical trial  including randomization of patients  radiology and laboratory management  and an increase of  related to the operation of our manufacturing facility to support the production of favid 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased from approximately million in to million in the increase of  or  was primarily due to an increase of approximately  associated with an increase in personnel from employees to employees  an increase of approximately  in directors and officers liability insurance premiums and public company related expenses incurred subsequent to our ipo  an increase of approximately  in recruiting and relocation expenses related to the increase in personnel  an increase of approximately  in fees related to market research studies  all of which were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  due to non recurring ipo related expenditures in amortization of stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of  and million in and  respectively 
deferred stock based compensation was reduced by amounts representing stock option cancellations and our repurchases of unvested restricted stock of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
we recorded these amounts as components of stockholders equity and are amortizing the amounts  on a straight line basis  as a non cash charge to operations over the vesting period of the options 
we recorded amortization of stock based compensation of million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from approximately  in to  in the decrease of  or  was primarily due to repayments of approximately million associated with our debt agreements with ge technology finance with interest rates ranging from to  offset by approximately million of new borrowings under new debt agreements  with oxford finance corporation oxford and ge capital corporation with interest rates ranging from to 
interest income 
interest income increased from approximately  in to million in the increase of million  or  was primarily a result of the increase in interest rates during and the higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance of million available for investment during as compared to million in the higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is due to the addition of net proceeds of million from our ipo in february liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have historically funded our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities and equipment and leasehold debt financing 
as of december   we had received proceeds of approximately million  net of stock issuance costs from the sale of preferred stock which was converted to common stock  proceeds from the sale of common stock in our ipo of approximately million  net of underwriters discounts and commissions and offering expenses  and proceeds of approximately million from the sale of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock to certain investors  in a private placement  net of offering expenses 
as of december  we had financed the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements through debt totaling approximately million 
total debt of million was outstanding at that date 
these obligations are secured by our existing and future assets excluding intellectual property and are due in monthly installments through july they bear interest at stated rates ranging from approximately to 
the debt agreements subject us to certain financial and non financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with the terms of the debt agreements 
cash flows as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million as compared to million at december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase resulted primarily from the million in net proceeds received from our private placement during the first quarter of  partially offset by net cash used to fund ongoing operations 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the same period in the increase of approximately million is primarily due to an increase in operating expenses related to additional personnel and other expenses related to the continuing clinical development and preparation for commercialization of favid 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the same period in the decrease of approximately million is due to an increase of approximately million in short term investment maturities net of short term investment purchases  offset by an increase of approximately in property and equipment purchases and the increase of million in restricted cash to collateralize the letter of credit  which has been increased to million as required by our facility lease agreement 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  reflecting primarily the net proceeds from our private placement of common stock and warrants in the first quarter of of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing for the same period in totaled approximately million  reflecting primarily the net proceeds of our ipo of million in february funding requirements our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the results of our ongoing pivotal phase clinical trial of favid  magnitude and cost of our product development efforts and other research and development activities  rate of progress toward obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates  costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative  licensing or other arrangements for the development  sale  marketing or distribution of our product candidates and the terms of those arrangements  effects of competing technological and market developments  and the success of the commercialization of favid 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and from equipment and leasehold improvement debt financing 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing may also adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
as of december   and  we have not invested in any variable interest entities 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties other than what is disclosed in note of the notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total includes monthly principal and interest payments 
the stated annual rates of interest on the loans range from to 
under terms of an existing supply agreement  we are obligated to pay fees of up to  based upon certain events occurring 
as the timing of those events is unknown they have been excluded from the table 
we also enter into agreements with service providers and clinical sites that administer and conduct our clinical trials  respectively 
we make payments to the service providers and sites based upon the number of patients enrolled 
for the years ended december   and  we had made aggregate payments of million  million and million  respectively  in connection with our clinical trials 
at this time  due to the variability associated with these agreements  we are unable to estimate with certainty the future patient enrollment costs we will incur and therefore have excluded these costs from the above table 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represents contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within relatively short time horizons 
as of december   we had million in restricted cash associated with our facility lease 
related party transactions for a description of our related party transactions  see certain relationships and related transactions 
subsequent event on february   we entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain investors relating to a registered direct offering of an aggregate  shares of our common stock at per share to the investors for gross proceeds of approximately million 
the common stock was issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the securities and exchange commission on february   in connection with a shelf takedown from our registration statement on form s file no 
which became effective on july  recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and will first be effective for us for the year beginning january  we are in the process of analyzing the effects of this pronouncement 
in july  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will first be effective for us for the year beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we may maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and direct or guaranteed obligations of the united states government 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
as of december   all of our short term investments were government agency securities  corporate notes and bonds  and our cash equivalents were held in checking accounts and money market funds
