item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements congress passed the private securities litigation act of to encourage corporations to provide investors with information about the company s anticipated future financial performance  goals  and strategies 
the act provides a safe haven for such disclosure  in other words  protection from unwarranted litigation if actual results are not the same as management expectations 
united desires to provide its shareholders with sound information about past performance and future trends 
consequently  any forward looking statements contained in this report  in a report incorporated by reference to this report  or made by management of united in this report  in any other reports and filings  in press releases and in oral statements  involve numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by united s statements for a variety of factors including  but not limited to changes in economic conditions  movements in interest rates  competitive pressures on product pricing and services  success and timing of business strategies  the nature and extent of governmental actions and reforms  and rapidly changing technology and evolving banking industry standards 
introduction the following discussion and analysis presents the significant changes in financial condition and the results of operations of united and its subsidiaries for the periods indicated below 
this discussion and the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements include the accounts of united bankshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  unless otherwise indicated 
prior to july   united operated two main business segments community banking and mortgage banking 
as previously reported  on july   united sold its wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiary  george mason mortgage  llc mason mortgage 
united s mortgage banking activities were conducted primarily through mason mortgage  which was previously reported as a separate segment 
for the years prior to  mason mortgage is shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
since the sale of mason mortgage  united s operations relate mainly to community banking which offers customers traditional banking products and services  including loan and deposit products  and wealth management services which include investment banking  financial planning  trust and brokerage services 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this document 
subsequent event on january   united announced the execution of an agreement and plan of reorganization to acquire premier community bankshares  inc premier headquartered in winchester  virginia 
premier is a million multi bank holding company with office locations in the northwestern and central parts of virginia and the eastern panhandle of west virginia 
premier operates three wholly owned banking subsidiaries  the marathon bank  the rockingham heritage bank and the premier bank 
upon completion of the acquisition  it is anticipated that all three banking subsidiaries will be merged with united s virginia subsidiary  united bank 
the acquisition of premier will afford united the opportunity to enter new virginia markets in the winchester  harrisonburg and charlottesville areas 
please refer to note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on this acquisition 
application of critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and 
table of contents judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  and the valuation of retained interests in securitized financial assets to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such  could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the most significant accounting policies followed by united are presented in note a  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the lending portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of estimated future cash flows  estimated losses on pools of loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  all of which are susceptible to constant and significant change 
in determining the components of the allowance for credit losses  management considers the risk arising in part from  but not limited to  charge off and delinquency trends  current economic and business conditions  lending policies and procedures  the size and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  concentrations of credit  and other various factors 
the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses is described in note a  notes to consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the factors leading to changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the provision for credit losses section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for a discussion of concentrations of credit risk  see item  under the caption of loan concentrations in this form k 
united uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management activities to protect the value of certain assets and liabilities against adverse price or interest rate movements 
all derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
the valuation of these derivative instruments is considered critical because carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are provided by third party sources 
because the majority of the derivative instruments are used to protect the value of other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet  changes in the value of the derivative instruments are typically offset by changes in the value of the assets and liabilities being hedged  although income statement volatility can occur if the derivative instruments are not effective in hedging changes in the value of those assets and liabilities 
united s calculation of income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination 
as part of united s analysis and implementation of business strategies  consideration is given to tax laws and regulations that may affect the transaction under evaluation 
this analysis includes the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
united strives to keep abreast of changes in the tax laws and the issuance of regulations which may impact tax reporting and provisions for income tax expense 
united is also subject to audit by federal and state authorities 
because the application of tax laws is subject to varying interpretations  results of these audits may produce indicated liabilities which differ from united s estimates and provisions 
united continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and records its estimate of probable exposure based on current facts and circumstances 
any material effect on the financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is further discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
compared to financial condition summary united s total assets as of december  were billion  a decrease of million or less than from year end the slight decrease in total assets was primarily due to a million or decrease in investment securities 
partially offsetting this decrease were increases in portfolio loans of million or  cash and cash equivalents of million or and other assets of million or 
the decrease in total assets is reflected in 
table of contents corresponding decreases in total liabilities of million and shareholders equity of million 
the decrease in total liabilities was due mainly to a reduction of million or in federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings and a million or decline in securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in deposits of million or and a million or increase in federal funds purchased 
shareholders equity decreased million or less than from year end due mainly to an increase in treasury stock of million and decreases in surplus of million and accumulated other comprehensive income of million which more than offset million of net earnings 
the following discussion explains in more detail the changes in financial condition by major category 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased million or from year end of this total increase  cash and due from banks increased million  interest bearing deposits with other banks increased million and federal funds sold increased million 
during the year of  net cash of million and million was provided by operating activities and investing activities  respectively 
net cash of million was used in financing activities 
further details related to changes is cash and cash equivalents are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
securities total investment securities decreased million or since year end securities available for sale decreased million or 
this change reflects million in sales  maturities and calls of securities  million in purchases and an increase of million in market value 
securities held to maturity declined million which was a decrease of 
this decrease was due to maturities and calls of securities within the portfolio of million during the year of the amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities  including types and remaining maturities  is presented in note d to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
loans loans held for sale decreased million or as loan sales in the secondary market slightly exceeded loan originations during the year of portfolio loans  net of unearned income  increased million or from year end largely the result of increased production in construction loans  commercial real estate loans and commercial loans not secured by real estate 
since year end  construction loans increased million or  commercial real estate loans increased million or and commercial loans not secured by real estate increased million or 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in consumer loans of million or and single family residential real estate loans of million or and from year end the table below summarizes the change in the loan categories since year end at december dollars in thousands change change loans held for sale commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate single family residential commercial construction other consumer less unearned interest total loans  net of unearned interest for a summary of major classifications of loans  see note f  notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents other assets other assets increased million or from year end due mainly to a million increase in the net pension asset as a result of a million contribution during the third quarter of  which was substantially reduced by an adjustment of million to initially adopt financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans to properly reflect the funded status of united s pension plan 
in addition  the value of cash surrender life insurance policies increased million 
partially offsetting these increases was a decline in deferred tax assets of million due primarily to the million increase in the net pension asset and a million increase in the market value of available for sale securities since year end in addition  derivative assets dropped million while core deposit intangibles decreased million due to amortization from year end the million drop in derivative assets related primarily to the termination of an interest rate swap associated with the repayment of a hedged million variable rate fhlb advance in the first quarter of deposits deposits represent united s primary source of funding 
total deposits at december  grew million or since year end in terms of composition  noninterest bearing deposits decreased million or while interest bearing deposits increased million or from december  the decrease in noninterest bearing deposits was due mainly to a million or decline in consumer noninterest bearing deposits as a result of the high performance checking hpc program that united launched during the first quarter of most of the checking accounts offered by united in its high performance checking program are interest bearing  and customers switched from their traditional noninterest bearing checking accounts to the new interest bearing high performance checking products 
in addition  commercial noninterest bearing deposits dropped million or as customers shifted money into interest bearing products due to higher interest rates 
partially offsetting these decreases in noninterest bearing deposits was a million increase in official checks due to a large amount of loan proceeds checks at year end the increase in interest bearing deposits consisted of growth in time deposits over  of million or  time deposits under  of million or  and interest bearing money market accounts of million or 
these increases are primarily due to a shift from noninterest bearing deposits to interest bearing products as a result of higher interest rates 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of million or in regular savings accounts

borrowings total borrowings at december  decreased million or during the year of since year end  
table of contents short term borrowings decreased million or due mainly to a million reduction in overnight fhlb borrowings and a million decline in securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
federal funds purchased increased million or since year end long term borrowings decreased million or due primarily to the repayment of a million fhlb advance during the first quarter of during the third quarter of  united completed a series of transactions to prepay two million convertible fhlb advances and terminate an interest rate swap associated with one of the advances 
at the time of prepayment  the fhlb advances and associated interest rate swap had an effective cost of 
the debt and interest rate swap had a remaining life of approximately years 
united replaced the million of debt with year and year fhlb advances and associated interest rate swaps that have a total effective cost of during the fourth quarter of  united through its subsidiary  sequoia capital trust ii  redeemed million of trust preferred securities 
the securities were redeemed at par value plus accrued interest 
the securities carried an interest rate of at the time of redemption

accrued expenses and other liabilities accrued expenses and other liabilities increased million or from year end due mainly to increases in income taxes payable of million due to lower payments  interest payable of million due to higher interest rates on borrowings and deposits and deferred compensation of thousand 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in derivative liabilities of million due primarily to the termination of a million swap in the third quarter of in addition  business franchise taxes payable and other accrued expenses decreased million and million  respectively  from year end due to the timing of payments 
shareholders equity shareholders equity at december  decreased million or less than from december  as united continued to balance capital adequacy and the return to shareholders 
the slight decrease in shareholders equity was due mainly to a rise in treasury stock of million due to repurchases of united shares by the company  a decline in surplus of million due to the exercise of stock options and a million decline in accumulated other comprehensive income due primarily to a million  net of deferred income taxes  adjustment to adopt sfas and a decrease of million  net of deferred income taxes  in the fair value adjustments on cash flow hedges 
partially offsetting these decreases were earnings  net of dividends declared  of million for the year of and an increase within accumulated other comprehensive income of million  net of deferred income taxes  in the fair value of united s available for sale investment portfolio 

table of contents since year end  a total of  shares were repurchased under plans approved by united s board of directors 
united repurchased  shares to complete a plan announced in to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock on the open market 
an additional  shares were repurchased under the current plan approved by united s board of directors in may of to repurchase up to million shares of united s common stock on the open market 
earnings summary net income for the year was million or per diluted share compared to million or per share for the year of the results for the year of included significant before tax charges totaling million to prepay certain long term debt 
during the third quarter of  united prepaid certain federal home loan bank fhlb long term advances in the amount of million and terminated an interest rate swap associated with one of the advances 
the prepayment of the fhlb advances resulted in before tax penalties of approximately million 
the termination of the interest rate swap resulted in a before tax loss of approximately million 
united s management believes that the prepayment of these borrowings and the termination of the interest rate swap will improve united s future net interest margin and enhance future earnings 
united s return on average assets for the year of was and return on average shareholders equity was as compared to and for the year of tax equivalent net interest income for the year of was million  an increase of million or less than from the prior year 
the provision for credit losses was million for the year as compared to million for the year of noninterest income was million for the year of  down million or when compared to the prior year 
included in total noninterest income for the year of was a net before tax loss of million on the termination of interest rate swaps associated with the prepayment of fhlb advances in the first and third quarters of as previously mentioned  during the third quarter of  united incurred a before tax loss of approximately million to terminate an interest rate swap associated with the prepayment of a fhlb advance 
during the first quarter of  as part of a balance sheet repositioning strategy  united terminated an interest rate swap associated with the repayment of a fhlb advance that was being hedged 
united recognized a million before tax gain on the termination of that swap 
in addition  united s income from investment security transactions declined million for the year of as compared to last year as united incurred a net loss on security transactions of million in the first quarter of due to an other than temporary impairment on approximately million of low yielding fixed rate investment securities that united subsequently sold as part of the balance sheet repositioning 
excluding the results of investment security transactions and interest rate swap terminations  noninterest income for the year of would have increased million or from the year of noninterest expense increased million or for the year of when compared the increase was due mainly to an increase of million in before tax penalties to prepay fhlb advances 
excluding the prepayment penalties  noninterest expense for the year of would have increased million or from the year of united s effective tax rate was approximately and for years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to for the following discussion explains in more detail the results of operations by major category 
net interest income net interest income represents the primary component of united s earnings 
it is the difference between interest income from earning assets and interest expense incurred to fund these assets 
net interest income is impacted by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in market interest rates 
such changes  and their impact on net interest income in  are summarized below 

table of contents tax equivalent net interest income for the year of was million  an increase of million or less than from the year of the net interest margin for the year of was  down basis points from a net interest margin of during the same period last year 
tax equivalent interest income for the year of was million  a million or increase from the year of as the average yield on earning assets for year of increased basis points from the year of due to higher interest rates 
in addition  average earning assets increased million or due to average loan growth of million or 
partially offsetting the loan growth was an million or decline in average investments 
for the year of  interest income from united s asset securitization increased thousand from the same period in interest expense for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of the increase in interest expense for the year of was mainly due to a basis point rise in the average cost of funds from the year of as a result of the higher interest rates 
the average cost of deposits was for the year of  up basis points from for the year of while the average cost of short term borrowing was for the year of  an increase of basis points from for the year of a sustained flat yield curve between short term and long term interest rates has resulted in a lesser increase in yields on earning assets while the upward trend in the general market interest rates has resulted in a more significant increase to funding costs

provision for credit losses united s credit quality continues to be sound 
nonperforming loans were million or of loans  net of unearned income  at december  compared to million or of loans  net of unearned income at december  the components of nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans that are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal  but have not been put on a nonaccrual basis 
at year end  nonaccrual loans were million  a decrease of million or from million at year end this decrease was mainly due to a decline in nonaccrual loan balances since december  as opposed to a change in composition 
loans past due days or more were million at december   a net increase of million or from million since year end the largest addition to loans past due days or more at december   was a commercial loan with a balance of thousand

management is not aware of any other significant loans or securities  groups of loans or securities  or segments of the loan or investment portfolio not included below or disclosed elsewhere herein where there are serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers or issuers to comply with the present repayment terms of the debt 
the following table summarizes nonperforming assets for the indicated periods 
december in thousands nonaccrual loans loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal  and are still accruing interest total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans are designated as impaired when  in the opinion of management  the collection of principal and interest in accordance with the loan contract is doubtful 
at december   impaired loans were million  which was an increase of million or from the million in impaired loans at december  this increase in impaired loans was due primarily to two loans totaling million to one commercial customer 
these loans involve the construction of real estate property and were not considered delinquent at december  based on current information and events  united believes it is probable that the borrower will not be able to repay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements and therefore  specific allowances in the company s allowance for credit losses have been allocated for these loans 
for further details on impaired loans  see note f  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united maintains an allowance for loan losses and an allowance for lending related commitments 
the combined allowances for loan losses and lending related commitments are referred to as the allowance for credit losses 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was million  compared to million at december  as a percentage of loans  net of unearned income  the allowance for credit losses was and at december  and  respectively

united evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis and its loan administration policies are focused upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
united s process for evaluating the allowance is a formal company wide process that focuses on early identification of potential problem credits and procedural discipline in managing and accounting for those credits 
this process determines the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses  allocation 
table of contents among loan types and lending related commitments  and the resulting provision for credit losses 
allocations are made for specific commercial loans based upon management s estimate of the borrowers ability to repay and other factors impacting collectibility 
other commercial loans not specifically reviewed on an individual basis are evaluated based on historical loss percentages applied to loan pools that have been segregated by risk 
allocations for loans other than commercial loans are made based upon historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions 
the allowance for credit losses includes estimated probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet fully manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  a portion of the allowance accounts for the inherent imprecision in the allowance for credit losses analysis 
over the past several years  united has grown through acquisition  and accordingly  expanded the geographic area in which it operates 
as a result  historical loss experience data used to establish allocation estimates might not precisely correspond to the current portfolio in these other geographic areas 
united s formal company wide process at december  produced increased allocations in two of the four loan categories 
the components of the allowance allocated to commercial loans increased by thousand due to the segmentation of the portfolio into two additional loan pools for which special allocations of million were established 
other factors that increased the allowance included an increase in substandard loan pool allocations of million and increases in commercial loan volume of million 
offsetting factors included the impact of lower historical loss rates and a change in certain qualitative factors 
the component of the allowance allocated to real estate construction loan pool also rose during the quarter by million primarily due to increased volume of million  reclassification of a million special allocation for condominium construction from the real estate loan pool to this pool and a specific allocation of million related to an impaired construction loan relationship 
the component of the allowance allocated to consumer loans decreased million as a result of decreases in historical loss rates  loan volume and a change in certain qualitative factors 
the components of the allowance allocated to real estate loans decreased by million due to the aforementioned million allocation reclassification  elimination of a certain allocation no longer deemed necessary and changes in loan volume and loss rates 
the unfunded commitments liability was stable  increasing by thousand and remaining at million 
an allowance is established for probable credit losses on impaired loans via specific allocations 
nonperforming commercial loans and leases are regularly reviewed to identify impairment 
a loan or lease is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will not be able to collect all amounts contractually due 
measuring impairment of a loan requires judgment and estimates  and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates 
impairment is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted at the loan s effective rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the selected measure is less than the recorded investment in the loan  an impairment has occurred 
the allowance for impaired loans was million at december  and million at december  compared to the prior year end  this element of the allowance increased by million primarily due to the aforementioned impairment of a large relationship involving commercial real estate construction loans as well as a thousand special allocation within the mortgage loan pool and changes among various smaller loans 
an allowance is also recognized for imprecision inherent in loan loss migration models and other estimates of loss 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending related commitments  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its methodology for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors to identify and quantify probable losses in the portfolio  the process includes subjective elements and is therefore susceptible to change 
this estimate for imprecision has been established to recognize the variance  within a reasonable margin  of the loss estimation process 
the estimate for imprecision at december  decreased by thousand to million 
this represents only of the bank s total allowance for credit loss and in as much as this variance is within a pre determined narrow parameter  the methodology has confirmed that the bank s allowance for credit loss is at an appropriate level 

table of contents the following table presents the allocation of united s allowance for credit losses for each of the five years ended december december in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate real estate construction consumer and other lending related commitments allowance for estimated imprecision less allowance for credit losses  discontinued operations total management believes that the allowance for credit losses of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses on existing loans and lending related commitments based on information currently available 
management is not aware of any potential problem loans  trends or uncertainties that it reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources which have not been disclosed 
additionally  management has disclosed all known material credits that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment schedules 
other income other income consists of all revenues  which are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets 
noninterest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving united s profitability 
recognizing the importance  management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced 
noninterest income was million for the year of  down million or from the year of included in total noninterest income for the year of was a million net before tax loss on the termination of interest rate swaps associated with the prepayment of fhlb advances in the first and third quarters of additionally  united incurred a net loss on securities transactions of million during the year of due mainly to an other than temporary impairment charge of million in the first quarter of on approximately million of low yielding fixed rate investment securities which united subsequently sold as part of a balance sheet repositioning 
united realized net gains of thousand on securities transactions during excluding the results of investment security transactions and interest rate swap terminations  noninterest income for the year of would have increased million or from the year of trust income and brokerage commissions increased million or due to a greater volume of business and a larger customer base 
united continues its efforts to broaden the scope and activity of its trust and brokerage service areas  especially in the northern virginia market  to provide additional sources of fee income that complement united s traditional banking products and services 
the northern virginia market provides a relatively large number of potential customers with high per capita incomes 

table of contents service charges  commissions and fees from customer accounts increased million or for the year of as compared to the year the largest component within this category is fees from deposit services which increased million or due mainly to united s high performance checking program introduced during the first quarter of in particular  insufficient funds nsf fees increased million during the year of while check card fees increased thousand 
deposit service charges and account analysis fees declined thousand and thousand  respectively  for the year of as compared to the year of mortgage banking income decreased thousand or due to fewer mortgage loan sales in the secondary market during the year of as compared to mortgage loan sales were million in as compared to million in income from bank owned life insurance policies decreased thousand or while other income increased million or for the year of as compared to last year s income during the same period 
other income increased as united received additional residual income of thousand from prior third party asset securitizations and income of thousand from the outsourcing of its official checks processing which united initiated in other expense just as management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced  it strives to improve the efficiency of its operations to reduce costs 
other expense includes all items of expense other than interest expense  the provision for credit losses and income tax expense 
noninterest expense for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of this increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to the before tax penalties of approximately million to prepay million of fhlb advances during the third quarter of excluding these penalties  noninterest expense would have increased million or for the year of  compared to the prior year 
for the year of  the remaining balance of the increase in noninterest expense was mainly due to a million or increase in salaries and benefits expense as compared to the same period last year 
salaries expense for the year increased million or as a result of the higher base salaries and performance based commissions 
health care and pension costs increased thousand or and thousand or  respectively  for the year of as compared to the year of the remainder of the increases in noninterest expense for the year of from the prior year was due primarily to expenses related to united s new high performance checking program 
united incurred marketing and related costs of approximately million during to launch and promote its high performance checking program for consumer customers 
however  the increased spending is having the desired impact of attracting low cost deposits 
largely due to the high performance checking initiative  united has opened  new consumer accounts during as compared to  new consumer accounts in net occupancy expense increased thousand or for the year of as compared to the year of the higher net occupancy expense for was due mainly to increases in building rent expense and real property taxes 
equipment expense declined thousand or for the year of as compared to the year of the decrease during was due mainly to a thousand gain on the sale of an oreo property during the second quarter of and lower levels of depreciation and maintenance expense 
data processing expense increased thousand or for year of as compared to the year of the increase was primarily due to additional outsourcing of data processing functions 
bankcard processing fees increased thousand or due to increased transactions for the year of as compared to last year 
other expenses increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of due primarily to the expenses previously mentioned related to united s new hpc program 
in addition  legal and consulting fees  excluding those related to the hpc program  increased thousand from the same period in the prior year 
atm processing fees were up thousand or for the year of as compared to due to increased transactions 
the remaining increase in all other expenses in the year of from last year was due mainly to increases in several general operating expenses  none

due to a modification on december  to accelerate unvested options under united s existing stock option plans and the fact that no new options were granted in  united did not recognize any compensation cost for prior to january   united accounted for its stock option plans under the intrinsic value method 
because the exercise price at the date of the grant was equal to the market value of the stock  no compensation expense was recognized 
at the annual meeting of shareholders held on may   the united shareholders approved the stock option plan and thus  became effective upon the shareholders approval 
no stock options have been granted under the stock option plan 
any stock options granted under the stock option plan in the future will be subject to the provisions of sfas r

united prepaid million of federal home loan bank fhlb long term advances and terminated an interest rate swap associated with one of the advances 
the prepayment of the fhlb advances and the termination of the interest rate swap resulted in before tax penalties of approximately million 
fourth quarter of net income was million or per diluted share as compared to million or per diluted share in the fourth quarter of tax equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of was million  a decrease of million or from the fourth quarter of the average yield on earning assets increased basis points from the fourth quarter of  however  the average cost of funds increased basis points due to higher interest rates 
average earning assets were relatively flat from the fourth quarter of as average loan growth of million or was more than offset by a decline in average investment securities of million or 
in addition  interest income from united s subordinated interest in a prior asset securitization decreased thousand for the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  down basis points from a net interest margin of for the fourth quarter of 
table of contents for the fourth quarter of  the provision for credit losses was thousand  a decrease of million from the fourth quarter s provision of million in net charge offs were thousand for the fourth quarter of as compared to million for the fourth quarter of noninterest income for the fourth quarter of was million  an increase of million or from the fourth quarter of the rise in noninterest income from the previous year s fourth quarter was primarily due to an increase of thousand or in fees from deposit services mainly as a result of united s high performance checking program  which was introduced during the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  united received additional residual income of thousand from prior third party asset securitizations as compared to last year s fourth quarter 
revenue from trust and brokerage services increased thousand or for the fourth quarter of due to increased volume and a larger customer base 
noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of was million  an increase of million or from the fourth quarter of this rise in noninterest expense was primarily due to marketing and related costs of approximately thousand to promote its high performance checking program 
in addition  salaries and benefits expense increased thousand or due to higher base salaries  pension and health insurance costs 
additional quarterly financial data for and may be found in note v  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effect of inflation united s income statements generally reflect the effects of inflation 
since interest rates  loan demand and deposit levels are impacted by inflation  the resulting changes in the interest sensitive assets and liabilities are included in net interest income 
similarly  operating expenses such as salaries  rents and maintenance include changing prices resulting from inflation 
one item that would not reflect inflationary changes is depreciation expense 
subsequent to the acquisition of depreciable assets  inflation causes price levels to rise  therefore  historically presented dollar values do not reflect this inflationary condition 
with inflation levels at relatively low levels and monetary and fiscal policies being implemented to keep the inflation rate increases within an acceptable range  management expects the impact of inflation would continue to be minimal in the near future 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities and off balance sheet arrangements united has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  that may require future cash payments 
the table below presents  by payment date  significant known contractual obligations to third parties as of december  total payments due by period one year one to three to over five in thousands total or less three years five years years deposits without a stated maturity time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings operating leases excludes interest 
includes interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations 
the interest associated with variable rate obligations is based upon interest rates in effect at december  the interest to be paid on variable rate obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates  which materially affect the contractual obligation amounts to be paid 
excludes carrying value adjustments such as unamortized premiums or discounts 
united also enters into derivative contracts  mainly to protect against adverse interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities  under which it is required to either pay cash to or receive cash from counterparties depending on changes 
table of contents in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value and not notional value on the consolidated balance sheet 
because the derivative contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  they are excluded from the preceding table 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note q  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
united s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for the loan commitments and standby letters of credit is the contractual or notional amount of those instruments 
united uses the same policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the following tables detail the amounts of significant commitments and letters of credit as of december  in thousands amount commitments to extend credit revolving open end secured by residential credit card and personal revolving lines commercial total unused commitments financial standby letters of credit performance standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total letters of credit commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses  generally within one year  and may require the payment of a fee 
further discussion of commitments is included in note p  notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity in the opinion of management  united maintains liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and the credit needs of its customers 
like all banks  united depends upon its ability to renew maturing deposits and other liabilities on a daily basis and to acquire new funds in a variety of markets 
a significant source of funds available to united is core deposits 
core deposits include certain demand deposits  statement and special savings and now accounts 
these deposits are relatively stable and they are the lowest cost source of funds available to united 
short term borrowings have also been a significant source of funds 
these include federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as well as advances from the fhlb 
repurchase agreements represent funds that are generally obtained as the result of a competitive bidding process 
liquid assets are cash and those items readily convertible to cash 
all banks must maintain sufficient balances of cash and near cash items to meet the day to day demands of customers 
other than cash and due from banks  the available for sale securities portfolio and maturing loans are the primary sources of liquidity 
the goal of liquidity management is to ensure the ability to access funding that enables united to efficiently satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and meet united s cash needs 
liquidity is managed by monitoring funds availability from a number of primary sources 
substantial funding is available from cash and cash equivalents  unused short term borrowings  and a geographically dispersed network of branches providing access to a diversified and substantial retail 
table of contents deposit market 
short term needs can be met through a wide array of sources such as correspondent and downstream correspondent federal funds and utilization of federal home loan bank advances 
other sources of liquidity available to united to provide long term as well as short term funding alternatives  in addition to fhlb advances  are long term certificates of deposit  lines of credit  borrowings secured by bank premises or stock of united s subsidiaries and issuances of trust preferred securities 
united through its asset liability committee evaluates these as well as other alternative funding strategies that may be utilized to meet short term and long term funding needs

cash provided by financing activities included million in proceeds from issuance of long term fhlb advances during the third quarter of  growth in deposits of million  and an increase in federal funds purchased of million 
for the year of  net cash of million was provided by financing activities primarily due to increases in total deposits of million 
cash used in financing activities in included million for payment of cash dividends and million for acquisitions of united shares under the stock repurchase program

united anticipates no problems in its ability to service its obligations over the next months 
there are no known trends  demands  commitments  or events that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in united s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
united also has significant lines of credit available 
see notes k and l  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the asset and liability committee monitors liquidity to ascertain that a liquidity position within certain prescribed parameters is maintained 
no changes are anticipated in the policies of united s asset and liability committee 
capital resources united s capital position is financially sound 
united seeks to maintain a proper relationship between capital and total assets to support growth and sustain earnings 
united has historically generated attractive returns on shareholders equity

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of united s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within united s policy guidelines 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet liquidity and interest rate risk exposures due to changes in economic conditions  interest rate levels and customer preferences 
interest rate risk management considers interest rate risk to be united s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in united s net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
achieving consistency in united s earnings is largely dependent on the effective management of interest rate risk 
management of interest rate risk focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within board approved policy limits 
united s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk to maintain an acceptable level of change to net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
policy established for interest rate risk is stated in terms of the change in net interest income over a one year and two year horizon given an immediate and sustained increase or decrease in interest rates 
the current limits approved by the board of directors are structured on a staged basis with each stage requiring specific actions 
united employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its exposure to changing interest rates 
one such technique utilizes an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes executive management projections for activity levels in product lines offered by united 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
rate scenarios could involve parallel or nonparallel shifts in the yield curve  depending on historical  current  and expected conditions  as well as the need to capture any material effects of explicit or embedded options 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management s strategies 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are defined as those assets or liabilities that mature or are repriced within a designated time frame 
the principal function of managing interest rate risk is to maintain an appropriate relationship between assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changing market interest rates 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities for specified periods of time is known as the gap 
earnings simulation analysis captures not only the potential of these interest sensitive assets and liabilities to mature or reprice  but also the probability that they will do so 
moreover  earnings simulation analysis considers the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet items and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
united closely monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities on an on going basis and projects the effect of various interest rate changes on its net interest margin 
the following table shows united s estimated consolidated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  and percentage change in net interest income change in interest rates basis points december  december given an immediate  sustained basis point upward shock to the yield curve used in the simulation model  it is estimated that net interest income for united would increase by over one year as of december   as compared to an increase of as of december  a basis point immediate  sustained upward shock in the yield curve would 
table of contents increase net interest income by an estimated over one year as of december   as compared to an increase of as of december  a and basis point immediate  sustained downward shock in the yield curve would decrease net interest income by an estimated and  respectively  over one year as of december  as compared to a decrease of and respectively  over one year as of december  this analysis does not include the potential increased refinancing activities  which should lessen the negative impact on net income from falling rates 
while it is unlikely market rates would immediately move or basis points upward or downward on a sustained basis  this is another tool used by management and the board of directors to gauge interest rate risk 
all of these estimated changes in net interest income are and were within the policy guidelines established by the board of directors 
to further aid in interest rate management  united s subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the use of fhlb advances provides united with a low risk means of matching maturities of earning assets and interest bearing funds to achieve a desired interest rate spread over the life of the earning assets 
in addition  united uses credit with large regional banks  and trust preferred securities to provide funding 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  united may use derivative instruments to protect against adverse price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities and on future cash flows 
these derivatives commonly consist of interest rate swaps  caps  floors  collars  futures  forward contracts  written and purchased options 
interest rate swaps obligate two parties to exchange one or more payments generally calculated with reference to a fixed or variable rate of interest applied to the notional amount 
united accounts for its derivative activities in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
during the year of  united realized a net loss of million in connection with the termination of interest rate swaps 
this was done to improve future earnings 
extension risk a key feature of most mortgage loans is the ability of the borrower to repay principal earlier than scheduled 
this is called a prepayment 
prepayments arise primarily due to sale of the underlying property  refinancing  or foreclosure 
in general  declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments  and rising interest rates tend to slow prepayments 
like other fixed income securities  when interest rates rise  the value of mortgage related securities generally declines 
the rate of prepayments on underlying mortgages will affect the price and volatility of mortgage related securities and may shorten or extend the effective maturity of the security beyond what was anticipated at the time of purchase 
if interest rates rise  united s holdings of mortgage related securities may experience reduced returns if the borrowers of the underlying mortgages pay off their mortgages later than anticipated 
this is generally referred to as extension risk 
at december   united s mortgage related securities portfolio had an amortized cost of million  of which approximately million or were fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
these fixed rate cmos consisted primarily of planned amortization class pacs and accretion directed vadms bonds having an average life of approximately years and a weighted average yield of  under current projected prepayment assumptions 
these securities are expected to have very little extension risk in a rising rate environment 
current models show that given an immediate  sustained upward shock of basis points to the yield curve  the average life of these securities would extend to years 
the projected price decline of the fixed rate cmo portfolio in rates up basis points would be  less than the price decline of a year treasury note 
by comparison  the price decline of a year current coupon mortgage backed security mbs in rates higher by basis points would be approximately 
united had approximately million in year mortgage backed securities with a projected yield of and a projected average life of years on december  these bonds are projected to be good risk reward securities in stable rates  rates down moderately and rates up moderately due to the high yield and premium book price 
however  should rates increase basis points  the average life will extend and these bonds will experience significant price depreciation  but not as significant as current coupon pools 
the remaining of the mortgage related securities portfolio at december  included adjustable rate securities arms  balloon securities  year and year mortgage backed pass through securities
