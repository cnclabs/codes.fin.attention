in  the company paid and recorded an additional million for the final payment to f therapeutics for completing certain contractual obligations 
investment impairments in september  the company recorded an million charge related to the other than temporary impairment of its investment in sangamo 
the investment was written down to million  which represented the quoted market price of sangamo s common stock at september  the company considered numerous facts  including those described below  to conclude that any impairment of the sangamo investment was temporary in nature as of the end of each of the quarters in and  and the first two quarters of sangamo s key internally established development milestones were progressing and or remained on track at each quarter end throughout and  and the first two quarters of there were no changes in technology that could impair sangamo s earnings potential of the investment and the technological progress supported a positive outlook 
the company believed that the number and scope of sangamo s programs and the range of its third party collaborations and the continued success in the company s sangamo related programs would significantly drive the value of sangamo 
moreover  the clinical momentum was building at the end of with the anticipation of three to four phase i human trials  the likely completion of one or more phase i trials with positive data and the planned announcements at major medical meetings 
management of the company believed that declines in sangamo s stock price were a result of certain external events and general investor sentiment of the biotechnology sector  and not sangamo specific activities 
in addition  the company recognized that  historically  reports of significant positive clinical outcomes had frequently resulted in a significant increase in the stock price of a biotechnology company over a relatively short time period 
management believed this would be the case for sangamo 
throughout all periods in which the company concluded that the impairment of this investment was temporary  sangamo maintained cash and liquid investment reserves sufficient to continue to fund the ongoing development efforts for the technology for periods well in excess of one year 
throughout all periods in which the company concluded that the impairment of this investment was temporary  the company had the financial ability and intent to retain this investment indefinitely 
sangamo s technology was considered important to the development of certain of the company s next generation products  and required a long term horizon for ongoing development of new technology 
sangamo is a multi technology human therapeutics  drug discovery and plant agriculture biotechnology company and has the ability to attract many different investors 
in addition  the diversity of technology applications served to dilute the risk related to any one application failure 
the company expected the market price of sangamo s stock to increase not only as a result of announcements of positive clinical trial results  but also other operational events 
during the second half of  sangamo announced five significant key developments regarding collaborative agreements  additional funding and breakthrough technology 
the company expected that this concentration of positive developments could have generated a considerable increase in the stock price  better recognizing the underlying value of sangamo 
based upon the significant developments in the third quarter of which  individually and in the aggregate  failed to have a material impact on the quoted market price of sangamo s stock  the continuing duration and severity of the impairment  and sangamo s declining cash position  the company concluded in september that the impairment on its investment in sangamo was other than temporary and  therefore  recognized an million charge in earnings 
in  the company recorded additional charges totaling million related to other than temporary impairment of technology investments in five other unconsolidated affiliates 
of the total additional charge  million related to declines in the stock prices of two available for sale investments 
the remaining charges were due to increased potential risk of certain private investees uncertain future liquidity 
in  the company recorded charges totaling million related to the other than temporary impairment of technology investments in four unconsolidated affiliates 
one of the impairments resulted from the decline in the stock price of an affiliate 
two of the affiliates had announced they were discontinuing their development efforts and the book value of those investments was reduced to the residual distribution edwards lifesciences expected to receive from those companies 
the remaining affiliate performed a reset financing that reduced the net value per share for all existing investors 
this investment is recorded at the reduced value 
charitable fund in december  the company made an initial contribution of million to establish the edwards lifesciences fund  a donor advised fund intended to provide philanthropic support to cardiovascular disease charitable causes 
in september  the company completed its funding goal and made an additional million contribution 
both of these contributions were irrevocable contributions to a third party and were recorded as charges at time of payment 
interest expense the million decrease in interest expense for resulted primarily from lower average interest rates  which resulted from the expiration of the company s fixed interest rate swap contracts in the third quarter of  combined with a greater portion of debt in low interest rate countries 
the million decrease in interest expense for resulted primarily from lower average interest rates  including the effect of interest rate swaps 
interest income the million increase in interest income for resulted from higher interest rates and a higher cash and cash equivalent balance 
the million increase in interest income for resulted primarily from a higher cash and cash equivalent balance 
other expense income  net the following is a summary of other expense income  net in millions years ended december  foreign exchange gains accounts receivable securitization costs other foreign exchange gains relate to the foreign currency fluctuation on the company s global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances 
the increases in securitization costs in and were due to increases in average interest rates and higher average securitized balances 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rates for   and were impacted as follows in millions years ended december  income tax expense at us federal statutory rate foreign income tax at different rates deemed dividends  net of foreign tax credit tax credits  federal and state state and local taxes  net of federal tax benefit valuation allowance for loss on investments nondeductible in process research and development expenses and milestone payment taxes on repatriation under the american jobs creation act of nondeductible stock based compensation reserve for uncertain tax positions for prior years other income tax provision the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law in october and allowed companies to repatriate cash during and into the united states at a special  temporary effective tax rate of percent 
on september   the board of directors approved a plan for reinvestment and repatriation of specific foreign earnings under the act 
the company repatriated million in cash in the company accrued million for federal  state and foreign taxes attributable to the distribution from its foreign affiliates in beginning in and through  the company recorded other than temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the tax benefits that result from reductions in the value of these investments are subject to the company realizing sufficient capital gains with which to offset these capital losses 
due to the uncertainty of the company realizing future capital gains  the company has consistently recorded valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets as they have accumulated 
as december   deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowances of approximately million had accumulated related to investments 
during  valuation allowances were made in each quarter against investment impairments recognized 
the valuation allowance amounts were million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter  for a total for the year of million 
also  during the fourth quarter of  the company realized a capital gain related to the sale of its vascular graft business and anticipated a capital gain in january related to the settlement of certain patent litigation against medtronic see legal proceedings 
as a result  valuation allowances were reversed  reducing income tax provision during the fourth quarter of by million 
similarly  in  the company recognized capital gains in the second quarter from the sale of a non strategic business and in the fourth quarter  a gain from the sale of the angiogenesis business and a capital loss on the sale of shares in world heart corporation 
the capital gains have allowed or will allow the company to utilize the same amounts of the accumulated losses related to impaired investments 
as a result  valuation allowances of million and million were reversed in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
of the million charge for acquired in process research and development related to the pvt acquisition in  as discussed in purchased in process research and development expenses  million is related to tax deductible payments to exercise certain licensing options pursuant to the stock purchase agreement 
the remaining million charge is non deductible for income tax purposes 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge for achieving the contractual transcatheter clinical milestone obligation with pvt 
the million payment is not deductible for income tax purposes 
on january  the company reported results in accordance with sfas r and recognized expense in related to stock based compensation 
some of those costs are not deductible in the united states or in foreign countries 
during the fourth quarter ended december   the company settled several of its ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions 
the company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at anytime 
while the company has accrued for amounts it believes is the expected outcome  the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the financial statements 
furthermore  the company may later decide to challenge any assessments  if made  and may exercise its right to appeal 
the tax reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  proposed assessments by tax authorities  negotiations between tax authorities  identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation  regulations or case law 
management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related interest  if any  have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations of uncertain tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of cash liquidity include cash on hand and cash equivalents  amounts available under credit facilities  accounts receivable securitization facilities and cash from operations 
the company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital  capital expenditures and other financial commitments 
the company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long term capital to fund short term and long term growth objectives 
however  no assurances can be given that such long term capital will be available to edwards lifesciences on favorable terms  or at all

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the company s accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in evaluating the company s transactions  management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  income taxes  any impairments of assets  forecasted transactions to be hedged  litigation reserves and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered  and collection is reasonably assured 
in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 
the company enters into certain arrangements in which it commits to provide multiple elements to its customers 
revenue related to an individual element is deferred unless delivery of the element represents a separate earnings process 
total revenue for these arrangements is allocated among the elements based on the fair value of the individual elements  with the relative fair values determined based on objective evidence generally based on sales of the individual element to other third parties 
when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products  an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable 
these adjustments include estimates for charge backs  rebates  returns  and other sales allowances 
these provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues  estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with wholesale and indirect customers 
if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity  the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 
the company s estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third party data  as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates  and reflect other limitations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions 
additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated 
inventory reserves result from inventory which is obsolete  nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration  or damaged or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
patent costs the company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications 
the company capitalizes legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable 
such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability 
to the extent the company is successful in its defense and enforcement of its patents and receives compensation for past infringement  costs capitalized in connection with the specific defense or enforcement are expensed as an offset against any gain received 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in evaluating goodwill  the company completes the two step goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the market capitalization and a market revenue multiple 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
since the adoption of sfas and sfas  the company has not performed the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit has exceeded its respective carrying value 
additionally  in accordance with sfas and sfas  management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long term  strategic equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development 
certain of these investments are designated as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these investments are carried at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method 
other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting  as appropriate 
the company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations  whereby the company owns a minimum of to of the investee s outstanding voting stock  under the equity method of accounting 
these investments are recorded at the amount of the company s investment and adjusted each period for the company s share of the investee s income or loss and dividends paid 
as investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value  the company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment s fair value 
when the fair value of a certain investment declines below cost  management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  the reasons for the decline in market value  the investee s performance against product development milestones  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
income taxes the company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure 
new laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates 
to the extent the company s estimates differ from actual payments or assessments  income tax expense is adjusted 
additional information regarding income taxes is included in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets of million  partially offset by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance of million as of december   reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
this allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain investments and the net operating loss carry forwards of certain united states and non united states subsidiaries 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards based on estimated fair values 
stock based awards consist of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period vesting period 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified

sfas requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a single employer defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in comprehensive income 
in addition  sfas requires employers to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end balance sheet 
sfas does not change the accounting for a multi employer plan 
sfas provides different effective dates for the recognition and related disclosure provisions  and for the required change to a fiscal year end measurement date 
in december  the company applied the requirements to recognize the funded status of its benefit plans and made the required disclosures 
as of december   the adoption of sfas increased the company s long term liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of taxes by million and million  respectively

sfas r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
although sfas r was to be effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that began after june   on april   the sec extended the date for compliance 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no

in addition  basic and diluted net income per share for the year ended december  were reduced by and  respectively 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense were reported as operating cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets  including currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
edwards lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps  option based products and forward currency contracts 
the company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the total notional amounts of the company s derivative financial instruments at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements  option based products  and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the company s exposure through its use of derivatives 
interest rate risk the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis 
there were no interest rate swaps in effect as of december  as part of its overall risk management program  the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates 
a basis point increase in interest rates approximately percent of the company s weighted average interest rate affecting the company s financial instruments  including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments  would have an immaterial effect on the company s annual interest expense 
currency risk the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in japanese yen and the euro 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net united states dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
the company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts 
the company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated  but not yet committed  sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates 
such contracts hedge the united states dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets 
any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
as part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs  the company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
option based products consist of purchased put options and  at times  written sold call options to create collars 
option based products are agreements that either grant the company the right to receive  or require the company to make payments at  specified currency rate levels 
as part of its risk management process  the company uses a value at risk var methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation  with a percent confidence level and a day holding period  to estimate this potential loss 
the company s calculated var at december  and  with a maturity of up to one year  is million and million  respectively 
this amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances 
the company s calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur 
actual future gains or losses may differ from and could be significantly greater than these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  and changes in the company s portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods 
in addition  the assumption within the var model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse  which may not be the case 
any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures  there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future 
credit risk derivative financial instruments used by the company involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in the event a counter party should default  and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations 
credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines  counter party diversification  monitoring of counter party financial condition and master netting agreements in place with all derivative counter parties 
credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at december  reduced by the effects of master netting agreements 
additionally  at december   all derivative financial instruments were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of aa or better by national rating agencies 
the company does not anticipate non performance by its counter parties and has no reserves related to non performance as of december  the company has not experienced any counterparty default since its inception in april concentrations of credit risk in the normal course of business  edwards lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry  performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses 
in  the company had no customers that represent greater than of its total net sales or accounts receivable  net 
investment risk edwards lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments 
the company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies 
these investments are classified in investments in unconsolidated affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   edwards lifesciences had approximately million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of million on these investments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones  the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary
