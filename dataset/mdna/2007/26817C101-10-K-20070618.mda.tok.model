item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes 
please see risk factors and forward looking statements for a discussion of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements 
unless otherwise noted  all amounts discussed herein are consolidated 
business overview we are a leading provider of specialized mission critical outsourced technical services to civilian and military government agencies 
our specific global expertise is in law enforcement training and support  security services  base operations and aviation services and operations 
we also provide logistics support for all of our services 
our current customers include the dos  the army  air force  navy and marine corps collectively  the dod  and commercial customers and foreign governments 
as of march   we had over  employees in countries  active contracts ranging in duration from three to ten years and over task orders 
our business strategy is to further increase our revenues and earnings by expanding current business opportunities  capitalizing on industry trends  pursuing commercial and foreign government opportunities and expanding our domestic service offerings 
we have a long standing record of providing services in support of a broad array of highly complex platforms and systems that are vital to our customers operations and  together with our predecessors  have provided support services to the us government for years 
we believe that the longevity and depth of our customer relationships have positioned us as a contractor of choice for our customers  creating a unique advantage and opportunity to cross sell our capabilities to capture additional contract opportunities 
the us government is increasing its reliance on outsourcing and has increased spending in our target markets 
operating environment we are primarily a us government contractor providing a broad range of critical technical services to civilian and military government agencies and to a lesser extent  commercial customers 
as a result  our operating performance for any time period is impacted primarily by trends in us government outsourcing  spending and the awarding of contracts and related payment terms which can have a significant effect on our business 
the trends we monitor and the impact we believe they have on our business are discussed below 
increased outsourcing by us and foreign governments we have seen and benefited from a continued trend toward outsourcing of services by the us government  particularly within the dod and the dos 
these outsourcing trends are seen both domestically and internationally and support the increased deployment of us resources overseas 
the increase in overseas deployment has been in both frequency and magnitude  and across multiple us government agencies 
for example  our gs segment has witnessed strong growth as a result of the us government s trend toward outsourcing critical functions 
outside of the us government  we are seeing other countries  particularly the united kingdom and united arab emirates  follow the us government trend to outsource services 
we believe that this provides additional markets for our existing services 
our gs reporting segment primarily provides outsourced law enforcement training  drug eradication  global logistics and personal physical security services to government and commercial customers in foreign jurisdictions 
gs has grown revenues from million for fiscal to billion for fiscal  or of our total revenues 
although we expect to continue to see increases in government outsourcing for the foreseeable future  particularly in government technical support services and other non combat related functions  the adoption of new laws or regulations that affect companies that provide services to the federal government or curtailment of the federal government s outsourcing of services to private contractors would significantly alter this positive trend 
increased spending by our customers the dod budget for fiscal  excluding supplemental funding relating to operations in iraq and afghanistan  has been proposed to congress at billion  representing a increase over fiscal the us government budget for international development and humanitarian and international security assistance coordinated by the dos has grown from approximately billion in fiscal to a projected billion in fiscal a compound annual growth rate of 
as a result of the us military s presence in the middle east and abroad  we believe that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future and that we are well positioned to benefit from this trend 
among the factors that could impact us government spending and that would reduce our us government contracting business are a significant decline in  or reapportioning of  spending by the us government  in general  or by the dod or the dos  specifically 
shift to more multiple awards in idiq contracts the trend in the service segment of the us government has been to award more multiple award idiq contracts 
we expect these trends to continue 
strong customer relationships combined with strong past performance will increase the probability of obtaining a customer s business under multiple award idiq contracts  as well as winning new procurements 
in fiscal and  and of our revenues were attributable to idiq contracts  respectively 
traditional government contracts typically have a base year award plus four to nine option years  limiting the competition to the year contract cycle 
under multiple award idiq contracts  the customer has the ability to compete for the work more frequently among the contract holders  or even move the work on a sole source basis to one of the other providers 
this trend toward multiple award idiq contracts could increase the volatility in our revenue but also potentially allows us to compete more frequently for work not previously secured 
shift from cost reimbursement contracts to time and materials or fixed price contracts our government contract services have three distinct pricing structures fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement  representing approximately of  and our revenues  respectively  for fiscal  and approximately  and of our revenues  respectively  for fiscal we believe that our profitability will continue to improve as we anticipate that our customers will continue to shift away from cost reimbursement to time and materials contracts and fixed price contracts 
we base our belief on recent trends in our revenues  the nature of the contracts on which we are bidding and the favorable pricing structure that exists within fixed price and time and materials contracts 
we assume financial risk on time and materials and fixed price contracts  because we assume the risk of performing those contracts at the stipulated prices or negotiated hourly rates 
if we do not accurately estimate ultimate costs and control costs during performance of the work  we could lose money on a particular contract or have lower than anticipated margins 
the movement from cost type contracts to time and materials or fixed price contracts  while increasing our risks  allows us the opportunity to earn higher margins 
increased maintenance  overhaul and upgrades o m needed to support aging military platforms another trend we monitor to determine our future strategy is the age and use of weapon systems 
the high visibility high cost weapons systems tend to be the target of budget reductions  while the o m budget continues to grow as a percentage of the total budget 
the o m portion of the dod budget  which includes the majority of the services we provide  is the largest and fastest growing segment of dod military spending 
also  as the purchase of new weapons systems is delayed or cancelled  the current weapons systems continue to age and require increased maintenance 
this aging  combined with the increased use of the equipment  often in harsh environments  provides opportunities for the services we offer 
competition we believe that the favorable industry trends that we anticipate may also attract additional competition by certain existing and potential competitors 
we compete with various entities across geographic and business lines 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do or are better positioned than we are to compete for contract opportunities 
in addition  we are at a disadvantage when bidding for contracts put up for re competition for which we are not the incumbent provider  because incumbent providers are frequently able to capitalize on customer relationships  technical knowledge and pricing experience gained from their prior service

costs of services in the fiscal year ended march  increased by million  or  compared with the fiscal year ended march  as a percentage of revenue  costs of services decreased to for fiscal year ended march  from for fiscal year ended march  the factors contributing to the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue were i continued strong performance of fixed price task orders under the civilian police and air wing programs  ii improved contract mix resulting from a larger proportion of higher margin fixed price and time and materials contracts  iii contract modifications for construction efforts in afghanistan completed in earlier periods  and iv wage pass through claims within the mtss segment 
these factors were offset by i operating costs in excess of contract funding to complete a base camp in iraq in the second quarter of fiscal  and ii the suspension of a security contract with a customer in saudi arabia

consolidated revenues total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were  million  an increase of million  or  from  million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
for the twelve months ended march  and april   approximately  and and approximately  and of our revenues were derived from fixed price  time and materials  and cost reimbursement contracts  respectively 
revenues from our gs segment for the fiscal year ended march  were  million  an increase of million  or  from  million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
increases in this segment include million of revenue under the international narcotics and law enforcement air wing program as a result of a new contract that went into effect on november  for operations  and added work to provide helicopter support for ground eradication efforts in afghanistan  million of new work providing hurricane relief efforts along the gulf coast  million due to added work under our africa peacekeeping contract with the dos and million of additional construction work under the worldwide personal protective services program 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of million under the civilian police program due to the timing of various construction efforts in the middle east  and million from a series of contracts to provide security and logistics support to various us government construction efforts in the middle east as a subcontractor 
this type of subcontract effort was typically short term with delayed payments  and therefore we decided to exit this line of business until it can be performed in a more stable environment with improved financial terms 
further offsetting the increases described above was a reduction in our dynmarine services of virginia llc business of million due to the discontinuance of our work under the oceanographics ships contract 
revenues from our mtss segment for the fiscal year ended march  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
the mtss increase of million was primarily driven by the life cycle contractor support program increase of million due to the addition of the global air traffic management avionics modification to the contract  an increase in the army pre positioned stocks program of million and the ramp up of the ah uh program  which increased million since the initial contract award during the first quarter of fiscal partially offsetting this increase was the contract field teams program  which decreased by million mainly as a result of reduced workload for maintenance  repair and refurbishment of weapons systems  and the end of the al salam program  which reduced revenue by million 
we withdrew from the al salam program due to unfavorable contract terms offered by the customer 
consequently  the customer decided to self perform the maintenance we had been providing 
in addition  the holloman contract decreased by million due to the removal of the german f s from the contract 
costs of services costs of services are comprised of direct labor  direct material  subcontractor costs  other direct costs and overhead 
other direct costs include travel  supplies and other miscellaneous costs

as a percentage of revenue  costs of services in the fiscal year ended march  was  a decrease from in the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
this reduction as a percentage of revenue was due to the following i strong performance on fixed price construction projects and on fixed price task orders under the civilian police program  and ii improved contract mix resulting from a larger proportion of higher margin fixed price and time and materials contracts as opposed to lower margin cost reimbursable contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily relate to functions such as management  legal  financial accounting  contracts and administration  human resources  management information systems  purchasing and business development 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
in addition  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the fiscal year ended march   an increase from for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
this increase was primarily the result of developing our administrative functions as an independent company  which contributed approximately million to the fiscal increase 
prior to the acquisition  these services were provided by our predecessor parent  computer sciences corporation 
in addition to the development of administrative functions  we incurred a higher business development cost of approximately million during fiscal business development expenses represented million or of total selling  general and administrative expense 
other factors contributing to higher selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal include non cash equity based compensation expense was million  legal expense of approximately million related to our legal contingencies  and certain incentive compensation payments related to retention bonuses associated with the acquisition and incentive payments related to our equity offering were million and million  respectively 
pro forma fiscal included approximately million of retention bonus expense 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase of million from million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
this increase was primarily due to higher depreciation expense 
amortization in the fiscal year ended april  pro forma was based on an estimate of current year amortization 
the amortization for the fiscal year ended march  was based on the acquisition  which included a step up in basis of our customer related intangibles resulting in increased amortization 
an independent valuation study was done to allocate the purchase price between goodwill and intangibles 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase from million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
the interest expense incurred related to our senior secured credit facility  the revolving credit facility and our senior subordinated notes 
this interest expense includes interest costs applicable to the fiscal year as well as amortization of deferred financing fees 
the increase was primarily due to the increasing interest rates during fiscal interest on mandatory redeemable shares interest on the mandatory redeemable shares  or preferred stock  for the fiscal year ended march  was million  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma  which gives effect to the net working capital settlement 
the interest is accrued  but unpaid 
income tax expense we had income tax expense for the fiscal year ended march  of million  an increase of million  or  from income tax expense of million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
the interest expense related to the preferred shares is non deductible for tax purposes resulting in the taxable position for the fiscal year ended march  results by segment we have aligned and report our business operations through two operating segments gs and mtss 
the following table sets forth the revenues and operating income for our gs and mtss operating segments  both in dollars and as a percentage of our consolidated revenues for segment revenue and as a percentage of segment specific revenue for operating income  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended april  pro forma

government services revenues revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were  million  an increase of million  or  from  million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
the revenue increase was due to additional revenue under the international narcotics and law enforcement air wing program as a result of a new contract that went into effect on november  for operation  added work to provide helicopter support for ground eradication efforts in afghanistan  new work providing hurricane relief efforts along the gulf coast  added work under our africa peacekeeping contract with the dos and additional construction work under the worldwide personal protective services program 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of revenue under the civilian police program due to the timing of various construction efforts in the middle east  and from a series of contracts to provide security and logistics support to various us government construction efforts in the middle east as a subcontractor 
this type of subcontract effort was typically short term with delayed payments  and therefore we decided to exit this line of business until it can be performed in a more stable environment with improved financial terms 
further offsetting the increases described above was a reduction in our dynmarine services of virginia llc business due to the discontinuance of our work under the oceanographics ships contract 
operating income operating income for the fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
operating income as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  and april  pro forma was and  respectively 
the increase is due to the following i strong performance on fixed price construction projects and on fixed price task orders under the civilian police program  and ii improved contract mix resulting from a larger proportion of higher margin fixed price and time and materials contracts as opposed to lower margin cost reimbursable contracts 
the civilian police contract changed from cost reimbursement to a combination of fixed price and time and materials in february  and the international narcotics and law enforcement air wing contract had a similar change effective november fiscal also includes the recognition of an equitable adjustment related to our civilian police program 
the equitable adjustment resulted in earnings of million during fiscal maintenance technical support services revenues revenues for the fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
this revenue increase was primarily from the global air traffic management avionics modification under the life cycle contractor support program  increases on army pre positioned stocks afloat program workload and ramp up of the ah uh program 
these increases were partially offset by reduced workload under contract field teams  and the withdrawal from the al salam contract due to unfavorable contract terms offered by the customer 
consequently  the customer decided to self perform the f maintenance we had been providing 
operating income operating income for the fiscal year ended march  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
operating income as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was compared to for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
the primary factors contributing to the decrease were as follows i higher indirect allocations not recoverable under our fixed price and time and materials contracts of million  ii incurred operating losses of million in delivering services to the us army under our life cycle contractor support program 
we have experienced operational issues in executing to the cost structure outlined in the original proposal 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our senior credit facility are our primary sources of short term liquidity 
our sources of operating cash generally include revenues and the reduction of our working capital  particularly accounts receivable 
in addition  we completed our equity offering in may and used the net proceeds  together with cash on hand  to repay a portion of our term loan 
based on our ability to generate cash flows from operations and our borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility  we believe we will have sufficient capital to meet our anticipated short term needs  including debt obligations for the foreseeable future 
consolidated cash flows the following table sets forth cash flow data for the periods indicated therein fiscal year ended dollars in thousands march  march  pro forma combined fiscal year ended april  net cash provided by used by operating activities  net cash used by investing activities   net cash provided by used by financing activities  operating cash flow  a key source of the company s liquidity  was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  as compared to the fiscal year the increase in operating cash flow is primarily attributable to earnings growth of million and cash flows provided by working capital of million  particularly  accounts payable and accrued liability activities related to the timing of payroll processing  interest payments and customer advances 
the timing for payroll processing  interest payments and customer advances can vary from quarter to quarter 
partially offsetting the increased operating cash flow was the payment of special cash bonuses subsequent to the equity offering of million in the aggregate to our executive officers and certain other members of management 
these bonuses rewarded management for their efforts in connection with the successful consummation of our equity offering 
cash flows provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to a use of cash of million for the fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year consisted of million of operating income before considering depreciation and amortization  less million of cash paid for interest and normal short term payment timing of trade receivables and payables 
cash flows used in operating activities for the period ended april  pro forma was million 
this cash use was primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid and other current assets  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accruals 
the primary driver behind the increase in accounts receivable was the timing of collections before and after the acquisition 
cash flows related to investing consists primarily of cash used for capital expenditures 
net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million for the fiscal year capital spending related to the purchase of property and equipment increased million in from levels to million  primarily due to purchase of vehicles  equipment and for certain leasehold improvements 
capital expenditures are made primarily due to contractual requirements 
we customarily lease our vehicles and equipment and intend to continue our practice of leasing our vehicles and equipment in the future 
our senior secured credit facility limits our annual capital expenditures related to the purchase of property and equipment to million 
we do not expect this limitation to have a material effect on our business 
net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal year ended april  pro forma 
for fiscal year ended  the primary use of cash was to purchase property and equipment 
for fiscal year ended april  pro forma  the primary use of cash was the acquisition 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to cash flows used of million for the fiscal year march  financing activities during the fiscal year included i gross proceeds received from the equity offering of million  ii payment of equity offering costs of approximately million  iii partial redemption of senior subordinated notes of million  including accrued interest  iv redemption of all outstanding preferred stock and related accrued and unpaid interest of million  and v payment of special class b distribution of million 
the cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year was due to the million repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  the million scheduled repayment of our bank note borrowings  the million payment of offering expenses and the million purchase of an interest rate cap that limits our exposure to upward movements in variable rate debt 
cash flows used by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to cash flows provided of million fiscal year ended april  the cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended march  is due to the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the amount of million  scheduled repayment of our bank note borrowings in the amount of million  payment for equity offering expenses of million  payment of debt issuance cost of million and the purchase of an interest rate cap for million  which limits our exposure to upward movements in variable rate debt 
the net cash provided for fiscal year ended april  pro forma is primarily due to the issuance of debt and capital contributions to fund the acquisition 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations and our available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on numerous factors beyond our control  and we cannot be assured that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness  including the senior subordinated notes  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
financing equity offering on may   we consummated an equity offering of  million shares of our class a common stock  par value per share  at a price of per share 
the gross proceeds from the equity offering of million  together with cash on hand  were used i to redeem all of our outstanding preferred stock  of which million in stated amount  including accrued and unpaid dividends thereon  was outstanding as of may   ii to pay a special class b distribution in the amount of million  representing a return of capital of million to div holding llc  the holder of our common stock  iii to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes on june   iv to pay prepayment penalties of million  million of which represented prepayment penalties on our preferred stock and million of which represented prepayment penalties on our senior subordinated notes  and v to pay transaction expenses of approximately million  including an underwriters commission of million  a fee of million to veritas capital and million of miscellaneous fees and expenses related to the equity offering 
debt and other obligations long term debt consisted of the following successor dollars in thousands march  march  term loans   senior subordinated notes   less current portion of long term debt   total long term debt   future maturities of long term debt for each of the fiscal years subsequent to march  were as follows dollars in thousands thereafter  total long term debt including current portion  senior secured credit facility on february   we entered into a senior secured credit facility the senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
the senior secured credit facility was initially comprised of a senior secured term loan of up to million  and a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to million  subsequently amended to million in november the full amount of the term loans was drawn at the closing to fund the acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements and pay related fees and expenses 
the term loans are due in quarterly payments of million through april   and million thereafter  with final payment due february  borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
the senior secured credit facility also provides for a commitment guarantee of a maximum of million  as amended  for letters of credit 
the senior secured credit facility requires letter of credit fees up to  payable quarterly in arrears on the amount available for drawing under all letters of credit 
borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at the company s option  either the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor  plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the leverage ratio  as set forth in the debt agreement 
the applicable margins for the prime rate and libor as of march  were and  respectively 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either the prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the leverage ratio  as set forth in the debt agreement 
the applicable margins for the prime rate and libor as of march  were and  respectively 
we are required  under certain circumstances as defined in the senior secured credit facility  to use a percentage of excess cash generated from operations to reduce the outstanding principal of the term loans in the following year 
under this provision  additional principal payments of approximately million are due to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal and are reflected in current portion of long term debt 
on may   we entered into an interest rate cap  which has the effect of placing a ceiling on the interest expense we could incur on million of variable debt indexed to libor at plus the applicable floating margin at march  as defined by the senior secured credit facility agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of interest rate derivatives 
on january   we entered into a first amendment and waiver of our senior secured credit facility 
the first amendment and waiver increased the revolving commitment under our senior secured credit facility million to million  which includes an increase in the sub limit for letters of credit equal to the same amount 
the first amendment and waiver also permitted us to i pay a transaction fee to veritas capital related to the equity offering of up to million  ii pay a distribution to the holders of our class b common stock in an amount equal to the sum of x million plus y the proceeds  if any  of the underwriters over allotment option  net of discount and estimated offering expenses  iii redeem all of our then currently outstanding preferred stock  and iv redeem up to million of the million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes 
the first amendment and waiver waived the requirement in the senior secured credit facility that we use of the net cash proceeds from the equity offering to prepay loans under the senior secured credit facility and or permanently reduce the revolving commitments 
on june   the company and its operating company entered into a second amendment and waiver of our senior secured credit facility 
the second amendment and waiver provided for a new term loan in the amount of million  which was the outstanding balance of the existing term loan under our senior secured credit facility on the date of the second amendment and waiver 
the maturity date of the new term loan is unchanged from the maturity date of the existing term loan 
the proceeds from the new term loan were used to repay the existing term loan 
the second amendment and waiver also  among other things  i decreases the interest rate margin applicable to the term loan under our senior secured credit facility  ii permits us to request an increase in our revolving credit facility by an aggregate amount of up to million provided that none of the existing lenders or any other lender is committed to provide such increase  iii increases the amount of capital expenditures permitted under our senior secured credit facility from million per fiscal year to million per fiscal year  iv increases the amount of capitalized leases permitted under our senior secured credit facility  v allows for the payment of dividends and the repurchase of our capital stock in the amount of million plus  if our leverage ratio as defined in our senior secured credit facility is below  of our excess cash flow as defined in our senior secured credit facility for each fiscal year  and vi postpones the first prepayment of the senior secured credit facility based on our excess cash flow until days following our fiscal year which ended on march  in november  the company obtained additional commitments from two new lenders which increased the revolving credit facility to million 
at march   availability under the revolving credit line for additional borrowings was approximately million which gives effect to approximately million of outstanding letters of credit  which reduced our availability by that amount 
the senior secured credit facility requires an unused line fee equal to per annum  payable quarterly in arrears  of the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility contain various financial covenants  including minimum levels of ebitda  minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios  and maximum capital expenditures and total leverage ratio 
non financial covenants restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments  pay dividends  create liens on assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  make investments  loans or advances  issue certain equity instruments  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations or engage in certain transactions with affiliates  and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities 
the carrying amount of our borrowings under the senior secured credit facility approximates fair value based on the variable interest rate of this debt 
senior subordinated notes in february  we completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due proceeds from the original issuance of the senior subordinated notes  net of fees  were million and were used to pay the consideration for  and fees and expenses relating to  the acquisition see note 
interest on the senior subordinated notes is due semi annually 
the senior subordinated notes are general unsecured obligations of our subsidiary  dyncorp international llc  and certain guarantor subsidiaries 
prior to february   we may redeem the senior subordinated notes  in whole or in part  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes plus a defined make whole premium  plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
after february   we can redeem the senior subordinated notes  in whole or in part  at defined redemption prices  plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
we can also redeem up to of the original aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes at any time before february   with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a price equal to of the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes  plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
the holders of the senior subordinated notes may require us to repurchase the senior subordinated notes at defined prices in the event of certain asset sales or change of control events 
on june   in connection with the equity offering  we redeemed approximately million of the million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes 
we also paid million in accrued interest through the redemption date and a prepayment penalty of million  and we recognized a million loss related to the write off of a portion of the previously capitalized loan cost for the senior subordinated notes 
see note for further discussion of this equity offering 
the fair value of the senior subordinated notes is based on their quoted market value 
as of march   the quoted market value of the senior subordinated notes was of stated value 
contractual commitments the following table represents our contractual commitments associated with our debt and other obligations as of march  fiscal dollars in millions thereafter total contractual obligations senior secured credit facility term loan senior subordinated notes operating leases interest on indebtedness contractual indemnity management fee total contractual obligations includes effect of mandatory payment of term loan with excess cash flow 
see note for additional information about our operating leases  see note represents interest expense calculated using interest rates of i on the term loan  and ii on the senior subordinated notes 
contracted statutory severance obligation due at end of contract 
payment will be deferred if the contract is extended beyond the current term 
for additional information on the management fee  see note backlog we track contracted backlog in order to assess our current business development effectiveness and to assist us in forecasting our future business needs and financial performance 
backlog consists of orders and priced options under our contracts 
we define contracted backlog as the estimated value of contract modifications received from customers that have not been recognized as revenue 
our backlog consists of funded and unfunded amounts 
funded backlog is based upon amounts actually appropriated by a customer for payment of goods and services less actual revenue recorded as of the measurement date under that appropriation 
unfunded backlog is the actual dollar value of unexercised contract options 
most of our us government contracts allow the customer the option to extend the period of performance of a contract for a period of one or more years 
these options may be exercised at the sole discretion of the customer 
historically  it has been our experience that the customer has exercised contract options 
firm funding for our contracts is usually made for one year at a time  with the remainder of the contract period consisting of a series of one year options 
as is the case with the base period of our us government contracts  option periods are subject to the availability of funding for contract performance 
the us government is legally prohibited from ordering work under a contract in the absence of funding 
our historical experience has been that the government generally has exercised and funded the option periods of our contracts 
the following table sets forth our approximate contracted backlog as of the dates indicated dollars in millions march  march  april  funded backlog    unfunded backlog   total backlog    in december  the company  through a joint venture named global linguist solutions llc gls  was awarded the intelligence and security command inscom contract by the us army for management of translation and interpretation services in support of operation iraqi freedom 
the five year contract has a maximum value of approximately billion 
we have a ownership interest in gls and will consolidate the joint venture in our financial statements 
as of march   the funded and unfunded backlog related to this program was million and billion  respectively  and has been included in the table above 
however  the incumbent contractor s protest of the award to gls was sustained by the government accountability office gao 
our backlog and estimated remaining contract value metrics may require future adjustment depending on the outcome of future procurement actions taken by the army in implementing the gao s recommendation 
estimated remaining contract value our estimated remaining contract value represents total backlog plus management s estimate of future revenues under idiq contracts that have not been funded  or award term periods that have not yet been earned 
these future revenues represent our estimate of revenue that would occur from the end of currently funded task orders until the end of the idiq contracts 
our estimated remaining contract value is based on our experience under contracts  and we believe our estimates are reasonable 
however  there can be no assurance that our existing contracts will result in actual revenues in any particular period or at all 
these amounts could vary or even change significantly depending upon government policies  government budgets  appropriations and the outcome of protested contract awards 
the following table sets forth our estimated remaining contract value as of the dates indicated dollars in millions march  march  april  estimated remaining contract value   off balance sheet arrangements the company s off balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease obligations and letters of credit  which are excluded from the balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
effects of inflation we have generally been able to anticipate increases in costs when pricing our contracts 
bids for longer term fixed price and time and materials type contracts typically include sufficient labor and other cost escalations in amounts expected to cover cost increases over the period of performance 
consequently  because costs and revenues include an inflationary increase commensurate with the general economy in which we operate  net income as a percentage of revenues has not been significantly impacted by inflation 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including those relating to revenue recognition and cost estimation on long term contracts  allowance for doubtful accounts  determination of goodwill and customer related intangible assets  goodwill impairment  accounting for contingencies and litigation and accounting for income taxes 
our estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current available information 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we have several critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
typically  the circumstances that make these judgments complex and difficult relate to making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates are as follows revenue recognition and cost estimation on long term contracts general revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services or products have been provided to the client  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues by contract type in fiscal and  and for the combined periods in fiscal were as follows fiscal year contract type fixed price time and materials cost reimbursement the company expenses pre contract costs as incurred for an anticipated contract until the contract is awarded 
throughout the life of the contract  indirect costs  including general and administrative costs  are expensed as incurred and are based on dcaa approved indirect rates 
when revenue recognition is deferred relative to the timing of cost incurred  costs that are direct and incremental to a specific transaction are deferred and charged to expense in proportion to the revenue recognized 
customer acceptance provisions generally allow the customer to cancel an arrangement when products delivered or services rendered do not meet benefits expected from the arrangement 
acceptance generally occurs before revenue recognition 
however  if it can be shown objectively that the acceptance criteria have been satisfied for separable units of accounting or profit centers  as applicable within an arrangement  revenue is recognized before formal acceptance 
management regularly reviews project profitability and underlying estimates 
revisions to the estimates are reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known by management 
major factors the company considers in determining total estimated revenue and cost include the basic contract price  contract options  change orders modifications of the original contract  back charges and claims  and contract provisions for penalties  award fees and performance incentives 
all of these factors and other special contract provisions must be evaluated throughout the life of the company s contracts when estimating total contract revenue to recognize in the periods in which they are earned under the percentage of completion or proportional methods of accounting 
federal government contracts projects under the company s us federal government contracts typically have different pricing mechanisms that influence how revenue is earned and recognized 
these pricing mechanisms are classified as cost plus fixed fee  fixed price  cost reimbursement  cost plus award fee  time and materials including unit price level of effort contracts  or idiq 
the exact timing and quantity of delivery for idiq profit centers are not known at the time of contract award  but they can contain any type of pricing mechanism  fixed price  time and materials  cost reimbursable or cost plus fixed fee 
revenue on fixed price projects is generally recognized ratably over the contract period measured by either output or input methods appropriate to the services or products provided 
for example  output measures can include period of service  such as for aircraft fleet maintenance  and units delivered or produced  such as aircraft for which modification has been completed 
input measures can include a cost to cost method  such as for procurement related services 
revenue on fixed price construction or production type contracts is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion 
progress towards completion is typically measured based on achievement of specified contract milestones  when available  or based on costs incurred as a proportion of estimated total costs 
cost of sales is based on actual costs incurred to date  and revenues are recorded in an amount equal to costs incurred plus the estimated gross profit based on the percentage of completion 
gross profit for any period equals total expected revenues less total expected costs  multiplied by the percentage complete at the end of the period in question  less gross profit recognized in prior periods 
cost reimbursement type contracts can be cost plus fixed fee  or cost plus award fee 
revenue recognition for these two contract types is very similar 
in both cases  revenue is based on actual direct cost plus dcaa approved indirect rates 
in the case of cost plus fixed fee  the fixed fee is recognized based on the ratio of the fixed fee for the contract to the total estimated cost of the contract 
in the case of cost plus award fee contracts  the fee is made up of two components  base fee and award fee 
base fee is recognized in the same manner as the fee on cost plus fixed fee contracts 
award fees for new contracts that lack specific experience are included in total expected revenues based on an average of the last two award fee periods or award experience for similar contracts 
the completed contract method is sometimes used for short duration projects when the results of operations would not vary materially from those resulting from use of the percentage of completion method or when reliable estimates cannot be supported for percentage of completion method recognition 
until complete  project costs are maintained in work in progress  a component of inventory 
contract costs on us government contracts  including indirect costs  are subject to audit and adjustment by negotiations between the company and government representatives 
substantially all of the company s indirect contract costs have been agreed upon through contract revenues on us government contracts have been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final settlement 
other contracts the company s contracts with non federal government customers are predominantly multiple element 
multiple element arrangements involve multiple obligations in various combinations to deliver products  perform services  grant licenses or other rights  or take certain actions 
the company evaluates these elements to establish whether they represent separable units of accounting and allocate revenue to the identifiable units of accounting based on relative fair values 
the timing of revenue recognition for a given unit of accounting will depend on the nature of the deliverable s whether recognition criteria have been met 
other contracts may include software and software related deliverables  construction contracts  and services with related equipment and materials 
the same pricing mechanisms found in federal government contracts are found in other contracts 
the company applies the guidance in fasb statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  to its software and software related deliverables  sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts to our construction contracts  and us securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
 and other transaction specific accounting literature to deliverables related to non federal government services  equipment and materials 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including but not limited to  those relating to allowances for doubtful accounts  fair value and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  profitability on contracts  anticipated contract modifications  contingencies and litigation 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts against specific billed receivables based upon the latest information available to determine whether invoices are ultimately collectible 
such information includes the historical trends of write offs and recovery of previously written off accounts  the financial strength of the respective customer and projected economic and market conditions 
the evaluation of these factors involves subjective judgments and changes in these factors may cause an increase to the company s estimated allowance for doubtful accounts  which could significantly impact the company s consolidated financial statements by incurring bad debt expense 
given that the company primarily serves the us government  management believes the risk to be relatively low that changes in its allowance for doubtful accounts would have a material impact on its financial results 
property and equipment the cost of property and equipment  less applicable residual values  is depreciated using the straight line method 
depreciation commences when the specific asset is complete  installed and ready for normal use 
as part of the purchase accounting  which resulted from the acquisition  all fixed assets were adjusted to fair value on february   thus resetting accumulated depreciation to at the acquisition date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisition 
the company s depreciation and amortization policies are as follows computer and related equipment to years furniture and other equipment to years leasehold improvements shorter of lease term or useful life impairment of long lived assets  including amortized intangibles values of customer related intangibles and internally developed technology were determined based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the estimated future after tax cash flows from those assets over their lives  including the probability of expected future contract renewals and sales  less a cost of capital charge  all of which was discounted to present value 
the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  when events and circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the carrying value of long lived assets and customer related intangibles is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that case  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
during  the company recognized an impairment of approximately million associated with a customer related intangible due to the loss of a contract in saudi arabia 
as of march   management believes there have been no other events or circumstances that would indicate an impairment of long lived assets 
indefinite lived assets indefinite lived assets  including goodwill and tradename  are not amortized but are subject to an annual impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of each of the company s reporting units with its carrying amount  including indefinite lived assets 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  indefinite lived assets of the reporting unit are not considered impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the company performs the annual test for impairment as of the end of february of each fiscal year 
based on the results of these tests  no impairment losses were identified 
income taxes the company determines the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their reliability exists 
equity based compensation expense the company has adopted the provisions of  and accounted for equity based compensation in accordance with  fasb no 
revised  share based payment statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions  equity based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period adjusted for forfeitures 
see note for further discussion on equity based compensation 
fair values of financial instruments fair values of financial instruments are estimated by the company using available market information and other valuation methods 
values are based on available market quotes or estimates using a discounted cash flow approach based on the interest rates currently available for similar instruments 
the fair values of financial instruments for which estimated fair value amounts are not specifically presented are estimated to approximate the related recorded values 
currency translation the assets and liabilities of the company s subsidiaries outside the us are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
gains and losses resulting from currency transactions are recognized currently in income and those resulting from translation of financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the inherent risk in market risk sensitive instruments and positions primarily relates to potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
for further discussion of market risks we may encounter  see risk factors 
interest rate risk we have interest rate risk relating to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
our policy is to manage interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either the prime rate or libor  plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the leverage ratio  as set forth in the debt agreement 
the applicable margins for the prime rate and libor as of march  were and  respectively 
as of march   we had million of indebtedness  including the senior subordinated notes and excluding interest thereon  of which million was secured 
on the same date  we had approximately million available under our senior secured credit facility which gives effect to million of outstanding letters of credit 
each quarter point change in interest rates results in approximately million change in annual interest expense on the term loan and  assuming the entire revolving loan was drawn  an approximately million change in annual interest expense on the revolving loan 
the table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long term debt agreements  as of march  expected maturity as of march  fiscal year average interest rate dollars in millions thereafter total fixed rate variable rate total debt the carrying amount of our borrowings under the senior secured credit facility approximates fair value based on the variable interest rates of this debt 
the fair value of senior subordinated notes is based on their quoted market value 
the above table does not give effect to million of outstanding letters of credit as of march  in april  in order to mitigate interest rate risk related to the term loans  the company entered into interest rate hedge agreements with notional amounts totaling million  whereby the company effectively fixed the interest rate at  plus an applicable margin at march  on the first million of its debt indexed to libor through may  the company concluded that the interest rate swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates 
at present  we do not utilize any derivative instruments to manage risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the functional currency of certain foreign operations is the local currency 
accordingly  these foreign entities translate assets and liabilities from their local currencies to us dollars using year end exchange rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss income
