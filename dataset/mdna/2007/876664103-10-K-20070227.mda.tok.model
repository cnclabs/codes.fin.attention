recent developments for a discussion of business developments that occurred in  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the shopping center business there are several types of retail shopping centers  varying primarily by size and marketing strategy 
retail shopping centers range from neighborhood centers of less than  square feet of gla to regional and super regional shopping centers 
retail shopping centers in excess of  square feet of gla are generally referred to as regional shopping centers  while those centers having in excess of  square feet of gla are generally referred to as super regional shopping centers 
nineteen of our centers are super regional centers 
in this annual report on form k  the term regional shopping centers refers to both regional and super regional shopping centers 
the term gla refers to gross retail space  including anchors and mall tenant areas  and the term mall gla refers to gross retail space  excluding anchors 
the term anchor refers to a department store or other large retail store 
the term mall tenants refers to stores other than anchors that lease space in shopping centers 
business of the company we  as managing general partner of the operating partnership  are engaged in the ownership  management  leasing  acquisition  development  and expansion of regional shopping centers 
the centers are strategically located in major metropolitan areas  many in communities that are among the most affluent in the country  including atlantic city  charlotte  dallas  denver  detroit  los angeles  miami  new york city  orlando  phoenix  san francisco  tampa  and washington  dc  range in size between  and million square feet of gla and between  and  square feet of mall gla 
the smallest center has approximately stores  and the largest has over stores 
of the centers  are super regional shopping centers  have approximately  stores operated by their mall tenants under approximately  trade names  have anchors  operating under trade names  lease most of mall gla to national chains  including subsidiaries or divisions of the limited the limited  express  victoria s secret  and others  gap gap  gap kids  banana republic  old navy  and others  and foot locker  inc foot locker  lady foot locker  champs sports  and others  and are among the most productive measured by mall tenants average sales per square foot in the united states 
in  mall tenants had average sales per square foot of  which is significantly greater than the average for all regional shopping centers owned by public companies 
the most important factor affecting the revenues generated by the centers is leasing to mall tenants including temporary tenants and specialty retailers  which represents approximately of revenues 
anchors account for less than of revenues because many own their stores and  in general  those that lease their stores do so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants 
our portfolio is concentrated in highly productive super regional shopping centers 
of our centers  had annual rent rolls at december  of over million 
we believe that this level of productivity is indicative of the centers strong competitive position and is  in significant part  attributable to our business strategy and philosophy 
we believe that large shopping centers including regional and especially super regional shopping centers are the least susceptible to direct competition because among other reasons anchors and large specialty retail stores do not find it economically attractive to open additional stores in the immediate vicinity of an existing location for fear of competing with themselves 
in addition to the advantage of size  we believe that the centers success can be attributed in part to their other physical characteristics  such as design  layout  and amenities 
business strategy and philosophy we believe that the regional shopping center business is not simply a real estate development business  but rather an operating business in which a retailing approach to the on going management and leasing of the centers is essential 
thus we offer a large  diverse selection of retail stores in each center to give customers a broad selection of consumer goods and variety of price ranges  endeavor to increase overall mall tenants sales by leasing space to a constantly changing mix of tenants  thereby increasing achievable rents  seek to anticipate trends in the retailing industry and emphasize ongoing introductions of new retail concepts into our centers 
due in part to this strategy  a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first mall stores in the centers 
in addition  we have brought to the centers new to the market retailers 
we believe that the execution of this leasing strategy has been unique in the industry and is an important element in building and maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity  and provide innovative initiatives that utilize technology and the internet to heighten the shopping experience  build customer loyalty and increase tenant sales 
our taubman center website program connects shoppers and retailers through an interactive content driven website 
we also offer our shoppers a robust direct email program  which allows them to receive  each week  information featuring what s on sale and what s new at the stores they select 
the centers compete for retail consumer spending through diverse  in depth presentations of predominantly fashion merchandise in an environment intended to facilitate customer shopping 
while some centers include stores that target high end  upscale customers  each center is individually merchandised in light of the demographics of its potential customers within convenient driving distance 
our leasing strategy involves assembling a diverse mix of mall tenants in each of the centers in order to attract customers  thereby generating higher sales by mall tenants 
high sales by mall tenants make the centers attractive to prospective tenants  thereby increasing the rental rates that prospective tenants are willing to pay 
we implement an active leasing strategy to increase the centers productivity and to set minimum rents at higher levels 
elements of this strategy include terminating leases of under performing tenants  renegotiating existing leases  and not leasing space to prospective tenants that though viable or attractive in certain ways would not enhance a center s retail mix 
in  we began a new leasing strategy which offers our tenants the option to pay a fixed charge or pay their share of common area maintenance cam costs 
this strategy has been positive for tenant relations  as it has allowed the retailer to decide whether fixed cam or traditional net cam works best for them 
our research suggests this approach is unique in the industry  the retailer can choose greater predictability for a modest premium in the fixed cam option 
from a financial perspective  our analysis shows the premium will balance our additional risk 
as tenants sign up for the fixed cam option  over time there will be significantly less matching of cam income with cam expenditures  which can vary considerably from period to period 
potential for growth our principal objective is to enhance shareholder value 
we seek to maximize the financial results of our core assets  while also pursuing a growth strategy that primarily includes an active new center development program 
internal growth we expect that the majority of our future growth will come from our existing core portfolio and business 
we ve always had a culture of intensively managing our assets and maximizing the rents from tenants  and we re committed to continue such efforts to drive even better performance 
our core business strategy is to maintain a portfolio of properties that deliver above market profitable growth by providing targeted retailers with the best opportunity to do business in each market and targeted shoppers with the best local shopping experience for their needs 
development of new centers we are pursuing an active program of regional shopping center development 
we believe that we have the expertise to develop economically attractive regional shopping centers through intensive analysis of local retail opportunities 
we believe that the development of new centers is an important use of our capital and an area in which we excel 
at any time  we have numerous potential development projects in various stages 
the mall at partridge creek partridge creek  a  square foot center  is under construction in clinton township  michigan 
the center will be anchored by nordstrom  parisian  and mjr theatres  and is scheduled to open on october   with nordstrom opening in spring the pier shops at caesars the pier  located in atlantic city  new jersey  began opening in phases in june gordon group holdings llc gordon  developed the center  and in january  we assumed full management and leasing of the center 
in addition  we are in final negotiations to increase our ownership of the pier from to 
we expect to complete this transaction and close on a refinancing of the property in the first quarter of we are negotiating agreements regarding city creek center  a mixed use project in salt lake city  utah 
demolition of the existing structures began in november the retail component of the project is expected to open in fall and will include approximately  square feet of tenant gla and macy s  nordstrom  and dillard s as anchors 
refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources planned capital spending regarding the status of this project 
in october  we announced that we are seeking a final decision in the supreme court of the state of new york suffolk county on our land use plan for our oyster bay project in syosset  long island  new york 
refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources planned capital spending regarding the status of this project 
in april  we formed taubman asia  which is the platform for our expansion into the asia pacific region 
taubman asia is headquartered in hong kong and is engaged in projects that leverage our strong retail planning  design and operational capabilities 
in january  we completed the development services agreement for a million square foot retail and entertainment complex in new songdo city  incheon  south korea 
the shopping complex is scheduled to open in early  with construction beginning in we have negotiated the opportunity to invest in a portion of the broader project  which will include not only retail  but also office  hotel  and residential uses 
we anticipate finalizing our decision on this investment in also in january  taubman asia announced our involvement in the retail component of macao studio city on the cotai strip in macao 
our policies with respect to development activities are designed to reduce the risks associated with development 
we generally do not intend to acquire land early in the development process 
instead  we generally acquire options on land or form partnerships with landholders holding potentially attractive development sites 
we typically exercise the options only once we are prepared to begin construction 
the pre construction phase for a regional center typically extends over several years and the time to obtain anchor commitments  zoning and regulatory approvals  and public financing arrangements can vary significantly from project to project 
in addition  we do not intend to begin construction until a sufficient number of anchor stores have agreed to operate in the shopping center  such that we are confident that the projected sales and rents from mall gla are sufficient to earn a return on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital 
having historically followed these principles  our experience indicates that  on average  less than of the costs of the development of a regional shopping center will be incurred prior to the construction period 
however  no assurance can be given that we will continue to be able to so limit pre construction costs 
unexpected costs due to extended zoning and regulatory processes may cause our investment in a project to exceed this historic experience 
while we will continue to evaluate development projects using criteria  including financial criteria for rates of return  similar to those employed in the past  no assurances can be given that the adherence to these policies will produce comparable results in the future 
in addition  the costs of shopping center development opportunities that are explored but ultimately abandoned will  to some extent  diminish the overall return on development projects 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital spending for further discussion of our development activities 
strategic acquisitions our objective is to acquire existing centers only when they are compatible with the quality of our portfolio or can be redeveloped to that level and if they satisfy our strategic plans and pricing requirements 
we also may acquire additional interests in centers currently in our portfolio 
expansions of the centers another potential element of growth is the strategic expansion of existing properties to update and enhance their market positions  by replacing or adding new anchor stores or increasing mall tenant space 
most of the centers have been designed to accommodate expansions 
expansion projects can be as significant as new shopping center construction in terms of scope and cost  requiring governmental and existing anchor store approvals  design and engineering activities  including rerouting utilities  providing additional parking areas or decking  acquiring additional land  and relocating anchors and mall tenants all of which must take place with a minimum of disruption to existing tenants and customers 
construction has been completed on an expansion and renovation of tenant space at waterside shops at pelican bay waterside 
in addition  nordstrom will join the center as an anchor in fall and an expansion of the current anchor  saks fifth avenue  will be completed in late with a full renovation of the store expected to be completed by summer at twelve oaks mall twelve oaks  construction is underway on an addition of a  square foot nordstrom 
in addition  the project includes a  square foot expansion and renovation of macy s previously marshall fields  and approximately  square feet of additional new store space 
a grand opening is planned for september construction is underway on a lifestyle component addition at stamford town center  which is expected to open in november the project is leased and will consist of a mix of signature retail and restaurant offerings 
the following table includes information regarding recent development  acquisition  and expansion and renovation activities that have been completed developments completion date center location june the pier shops at caesars atlantic city  new jersey september northlake mall charlotte  north carolina acquisitions completion date center location october land under sunvalley concord  california july international plaza tampa  florida additional interest january beverly center los angeles  california additional interest expansions and renovations completion date center location september waterside shops at pelican bay naples  florida began opening in phases 
in july  an additional interest in the center was acquired 
in january  the joint venture partner s interest in the center was acquired 
rental rates as leases have expired in the centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in periods of increasing sales  such as those we are currently experiencing  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following tables contain certain information regarding per square foot minimum rent in our consolidated businesses and unconsolidated joint ventures at the comparable centers centers that had been owned and open for the current and preceding year average rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures opening base rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures square feet of gla opened consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures closing base rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures square feet of gla closed consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures releasing spread per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures the spread between opening and closing rents may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
lease expirations the following table shows scheduled lease expirations based on information available as of december  for the next ten years for all owned centers in operation at that date  excluding arizona mills and the pier lease expiration year number of leases expiring leased area in square footage annualized base rent under expiring leases in thousands of dollars annualized base rent under expiring leases per square foot percent of total leased square footage represented by expiring leases excludes leases that expire in for which renewal leases or leases with replacement tenants have been executed as of december  we believe that the information in the table is not necessarily indicative of what will occur in the future because of several factors  but principally because of early lease terminations at the centers 
for example  the average remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the period to was approximately two years 
the average term of leases signed during and was approximately seven years 
in addition  mall tenants at the centers may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which could result in the termination of such tenants leases and thus cause a reduction in cash flow 
in  of leases were affected compared to in this statistic has ranged from to since we went public in since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
occupancy occupancy statistics include centers owned and open in the full periods presented  and value center anchors 
the statistics for comparable centers exclude northlake mall northlake  which opened in the statistics for comparable centers also exclude waterside due to the recent renovation and expansion  and woodland  which was sold in the fourth quarter of all statistics exclude the pier  which opened in all centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy comparable centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy major tenants no single retail company represents or more of our revenues

jill ann taylor the tjx companies marshalls  tj maxx luxottica lenscrafters  sunglass hut international  things remembered  and others general risks of the company the economic performance and value of our shopping centers are dependent on many factors the economic performance and value of our shopping centers are dependent on various factors 
additionally  these same factors will influence our decision whether to go forward on the development of new centers and may affect the ultimate economic performance and value of projects under construction 
adverse changes in the economic performance and value of our shopping centers would adversely affect our income and cash available to pay dividends 
such factors include changes in the national  regional  and or local economic and geopolitical climates  increases in operating costs  the public perception of the safety of customers at our shopping centers  legal liabilities  availability and cost of financing  changes in government regulations  and changes in real estate zoning and tax laws 
in addition  the value and performance of our shopping centers may be adversely affected by certain other factors discussed below including competition  uninsured losses  and environmental liabilities 
we are in a competitive business 
there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with our properties in attracting retailers to lease space 
in addition  retailers at our properties face continued competition from discount shopping centers  lifestyle centers  outlet malls  wholesale and discount shopping clubs  direct mail  telemarketing  television shopping networks and shopping via the internet 
competition of this type could adversely affect our revenues and cash available for distribution to stockholders 
we compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment opportunities 
these competitors include other reits  investment banking firms and private institutional investors 
this competition has increased prices for commercial properties and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future 
some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 
we carry standard liability  fire  flood  earthquake  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on each of our properties 
we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate 
there are  however  some types of losses  including lease and other contract claims  that generally are not insured 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property 
if this happens  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
in november  congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  which required insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage to all existing insured companies for an additional cost 
as a result  our standard property insurance policies are currently provided without a sub limit for terrorism  eliminating the need for separate terrorism insurance policies 
in  congress extended the expiration date of tria to december  while congress may further extend or replace tria  the possibility exists that tria may be allowed to expire at the end of there are specific provisions in our loans that address terrorism insurance 
simply stated  in most loans  we are obligated to obtain terrorism insurance  but there are limits on the amounts we could be required to spend to obtain such coverage 
if congress fails to further extend or replace tria or if another terrorist event occurs  we would likely pay higher amounts for terrorism insurance coverage and or obtain less coverage than we have currently 
our inability to obtain such coverage or to do so only at greatly increased costs may also negatively impact the availability and cost of future financings 
we may be subject to liabilities for environmental matters 
all of the centers presently owned by us not including option interests in certain pre development projects have been subject to environmental assessments 
no assurances can be given  however  that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner  operator  or current occupant has created an environmental condition not known to us 
moreover  no assurances can be given that future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of the centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the centers  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the centers such as the presence of underground storage tanks or by third parties unrelated to us 
we hold investments in joint ventures in which we do not control all decisions  and we may have conflicts of interest with our joint venture partners 
some of our shopping centers are partially owned by non affiliated partners through joint venture arrangements 
as a result  we do not control all decisions regarding those shopping centers and may be required to take actions that are in the interest of the joint venture partners but not our best interests 
accordingly  we may not be able to favorably resolve any issues which arise with respect to such decisions  or we may have to provide financial or other inducements to our joint venture partners to obtain such resolution 
for joint ventures that we do not manage  we do not control decisions as to the design or operation of internal controls over accounting and financial reporting  including those relating to maintenance of accounting records  authorization of receipts and disbursements  selection and application of accounting policies  reviews of period end financial reporting  and safeguarding of assets 
therefore  we are exposed to risk that such controls may not be designed or operating effectively  which could ultimately affect the accuracy of financial information related to these joint ventures as prepared by our joint venture partners 
various restrictive provisions and rights govern sales or transfers of interests in our joint ventures 
these may work to our disadvantage because  among other things  we may be required to make decisions as to the purchase or sale of interests in our joint ventures at a time that is disadvantageous to us 
the bankruptcy of our tenants  anchors or joint venture partners could adversely affect us 
we could be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of third parties 
the bankruptcy of a mall tenant could result in the termination of its lease  which would lower the amount of cash generated by that mall 
in addition  if a department store operating as an anchor at one of our shopping centers were to go into bankruptcy and cease operating  we may experience difficulty and delay in replacing the anchor 
in addition  the anchor s closing may lead to reduced customer traffic and lower mall tenant sales 
as a result  we may also experience difficulty or delay in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant anchor space 
the profitability of shopping centers held in a joint venture could also be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of one of the joint venture partners if  because of certain provisions of the bankruptcy laws  we were unable to make important decisions in a timely fashion or became subject to additional liabilities 
our investments are subject to credit and market risk 
we occasionally extend credit to third parties in connection with the sale of land or other transactions 
we have occasionally made investments in marketable and other equity securities 
we are exposed to risk in the event the values of our investments and or our loans decrease due to overall market conditions  business failure  and or other nonperformance by the investees or counterparties 
our real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
we may be limited in our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions by restrictions on transfer imposed by our partners or lenders 
in addition  under trg s partnership agreement  upon the sale of a center or trg s interest in a center  trg may be required to distribute to its partners all of the cash proceeds received by trg from such sale 
if trg made such a distribution  the sale proceeds would not be available to finance trg s activities  and the sale of a center may result in a decrease in funds generated by continuing operations and in distributions to trg s partners  including us 
we may acquire or develop new properties  and these activities are subject to various risks 
we actively pursue development and acquisition activities as opportunities arise  and these activities are subject to the following risks the pre construction phase for a regional center typically extends over several years  and the time to obtain anchor commitments  zoning and regulatory approvals  and public financing can vary significantly from project to project  we may not be able to obtain the necessary zoning or other governmental approvals for a project  or we may determine that the expected return on a project is not sufficient  if we abandon our development activities with respect to a particular project  we may incur a loss on our investment  construction and other project costs may exceed our original estimates because of increases in material and labor costs  delays and costs to obtain anchor and tenant commitments  we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance construction loans  which are generally recourse to trg  and occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may not meet our projections  and the costs of development activities that we explore but ultimately abandon will  to some extent  diminish the overall return on our completed development projects 
we are engaged in development and service activities and are evaluating investments in international markets  and these activities are subject to risks that may reduce our financial return 
in addition to the general risks related to development and acquisition activities described in the preceding section  our international activities are subject to unique risks  including adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies  changes in foreign political environments  difficulties of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance  operations  taxes  and litigation  changes in and or difficulties in complying with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations  including the foreign corrupt practices act  difficulties in managing international operations  including difficulties that arise from ambiguities in contracts written in foreign languages  and obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash 
although our international activities are currently limited in their scope  to the extent that we expand them  these risks could increase in significance and adversely affect our financial returns on international projects and services and overall financial condition 
we have put in place policies  practices  and systems for mitigating these international risks  although we cannot provide assurance that we will be entirely successful in doing so 
we may not be able to maintain our status as a reit 
we may not be able to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes with the result that the income distributed to shareholders will not be deductible in computing taxable income and instead would be subject to tax at regular corporate rates 
we may also be subject to the alternative minimum tax if we fail to maintain our status as a reit 
any such corporate tax liability would be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders which  in turn  could have a material adverse impact on the value of  or trading price for  our shares 
although we believe we are organized and operate in a manner to maintain our reit qualification  many of the reit requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  are very complex and have limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
changes in tax laws or regulations or new administrative interpretations and court decisions may also affect our ability to maintain reit status in the future 
if we do not maintain our reit status in any year  we may be unable to elect to be treated as a reit for the next four taxable years 
although we currently intend to maintain our status as a reit  future economic  market  legal  tax  or other considerations may cause us to determine that it would be in our and our shareholders best interests to revoke our reit election 
if we revoke our reit election  we will not be able to elect reit status for the next four taxable years 
we may be subject to taxes even if we qualify as a reit 
even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will be required to pay certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
for example  we will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of our reit taxable income  including capital gains 
moreover  if we have net income from prohibited transactions  that income will be subject to a penalty tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale 
we cannot guarantee that sales of our properties would not be prohibited transactions unless we comply with certain statutory safe harbor provisions 
the need to avoid prohibited transactions could cause us to forego or defer sales of facilities that non reits otherwise would have sold or that might otherwise be in our best interest to sell 
in addition  any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable reit subsidiaries will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax 
in this regard  several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct certain interest payments made to an affiliated reit 
in addition  the reit has to pay a penalty tax on some payments that it receives or on some deductions taken by the taxable reit subsidiaries if the economic arrangements between the reit  the reit s tenants  and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties 
finally  some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income  because not all states and localities follow the federal income tax treatment of reits 
to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal  state and local taxes  we will have less cash available for distributions to our shareholders 
the lower tax rate on certain dividends from non reit c corporations may cause investors to prefer to hold stock in non reit c corporations 
whereas corporate dividends have traditionally been taxed at ordinary income rates  the maximum tax rate on certain corporate dividends received by individuals through december   has been reduced from to 
this change has reduced substantially the so called double taxation that is  taxation at both the corporate and shareholder levels that had generally applied to non reit c corporations but did not apply to reits 
generally  dividends from reits do not qualify for the dividend tax reduction because reits generally do not pay corporate level tax on income that they distribute currently to shareholders 
reit dividends are only eligible for the lower capital gains rates in limited circumstances in which the dividends are attributable to income  such as dividends from a taxable reit subsidiary  that has been subject to corporate level tax 
the application of capital gains rates to non reit c corporation dividends could cause individual investors to view stock in non reit c corporations as more attractive than shares in reits  which may negatively affect the value of our shares 
our ownership limitations and other provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may hinder any attempt to acquire us 
the general limitations on ownership of our capital stock and other provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and of inhibiting a change in control  which could adversely affect our shareholders ability to receive a premium for their shares in connection with such a transaction 
members of the taubman family have the power to vote a significant number of the shares of our capital stock entitled to vote 
based on information contained in filings made with the sec  as of december   a 
alfred taubman and the members of his family have the power to vote approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock and our series b preferred stock  considered together as a single class  and approximately of our outstanding series b preferred stock 
our shares of common stock and our series b preferred stock vote together as a single class on all matters generally submitted to a vote of our shareholders  and the holders of the series b preferred stock have certain rights to nominate up to four individuals for election to our board of directors and other class voting rights 
mr 
taubman s sons  robert s 
taubman and william s 
taubman  serve as our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  and our chief operating officer  respectively 
these individuals occupy the same positions with the taubman company  llc  which manages all of our properties 
as a result  mr 
a 
alfred taubman and the members of his family may exercise significant influence with respect to the election of our board of directors  the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our shareholders for approval  including any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  because our articles of incorporation impose a limitation on the ownership of our outstanding capital stock by any person and such ownership limitation may not be changed without the affirmative vote of holders owning not less than two thirds of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such matter  mr 
a 
alfred taubman and the members of his family have the power to prevent a change in control of our company 
our ability to pay dividends on our stock may be limited 
because we conduct all of our operations through trg  our ability to pay dividends on our stock will depend almost entirely on payments and dividends received on our interests in trg 
additionally  the terms of some of the debt to which trg is a party limits its ability to make some types of payments and other dividends to us 
this in turn limits our ability to make some types of payments  including payment of dividends on our stock  unless we meet certain financial tests or such payments or dividends are required to maintain our qualification as a reit 
as a result  if we are unable to meet the applicable financial tests  we may not be able to pay dividends on our stock in one or more periods 
our ability to pay dividends is further limited by the requirements of michigan law 
our ability to pay dividends on our stock is further limited by the laws of michigan 
under the michigan business corporation act  a michigan corporation may not make a distribution if  after giving effect to the distribution  the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as the debts become due in the usual course of business  or the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed  if the corporation were dissolved at the time of the distribution  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution 
accordingly  we may not make a distribution on our stock if  after giving effect to the distribution  we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of the holders of any shares of our preferred stock then outstanding 
we may incur additional indebtedness  which may harm our financial position and cash flow and potentially impact our ability to pay dividends on our stock 
our governing documents do not limit us from incurring additional indebtedness and other liabilities 
as of december   we had approximately billion of consolidated indebtedness outstanding  and our beneficial interest in both our consolidated debt and the debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures was billion 
we may incur additional indebtedness and become more highly leveraged  which could harm our financial position and potentially limit our cash available to pay dividends 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends regularly although we have done so in the past 
our ability to pay dividends in the future is dependent on our ability to operate profitably and to generate cash from our operations 
although we have done so in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends on a regular quarterly basis in the future 
furthermore  any new shares of common stock issued will increase the cash required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following statements regarding future developments and joint ventures  rents and returns  statements regarding the continuation of trends  and any statements regarding the sufficiency of our cash balances and cash generated from operating and financing activities for our future liquidity and capital resource needs 
we caution that although forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs and best judgment based upon current information  these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including those risks  uncertainties  and factors detailed from time to time in reports filed with the sec  and in particular those set forth under the headings general risks of the company and environmental matters in item of this annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement taubman centers  inc we  us  our or tco owns a managing general partner s interest in the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg  through which we conduct all of our operations 
the operating partnership owns  develops  acquires  and operates shopping centers 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreement  development projects for future regional shopping centers  variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary  and the taubman company llc manager 
shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
references in this discussion to beneficial interest refer to our ownership or pro rata share of the item being discussed 
also  the operations of the shopping centers are often best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to our ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
the comparability of information used in measuring performance is affected by the opening of northlake in september and the sale of our interest in woodland in december  as well as the expansion and renovation at waterside 
the pier began opening stores in late june  and is accounted for under the equity method 
the pier has been excluded from all operating statistics 
additional comparable center statistics that exclude northlake  waterside  and woodland are provided for and to present the performance of comparable centers in our continuing operations 
comparable centers are generally defined as centers that were owned and open for two years 
as of january   we began consolidating the entity that owns cherry creek 
the center is included within our consolidated results and statistics as of that date  while it continues to be presented as an unconsolidated joint venture for dates and periods prior to january  overall summary of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business is to lease space in our shopping centers 
generally these leases are long term  with our average lease term at approximately years 
therefore general economic trends most directly impact our tenants sales and consequently their ability to perform under their existing lease agreements and expand into new locations as well as our ability to find new tenants for our shopping centers 
occupancy continued to increase during  and we anticipate continued occupancy growth throughout  although we expect more modest increases in the first half of than in the second half 
average rent per square foot increased by in and we anticipate rent per square foot to increase in the range of in tenant sales trends demonstrated strong growth in  increasing and reaching a new record level of per square foot for our comparable centers 
this increase in sales resulted in a significant increase in percentage rent in we believe these improving tenant sales provide us an opportunity to continue to increase rents in the future see mall tenant sales and center revenues and rental rates and occupancy 
the rents we are able to achieve are similarly affected by economic trends and tenants expectations thereof  as described under rental rates and occupancy 
the spread between rents on openings and closings may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
mall tenant sales  occupancy levels and our resulting revenues are seasonal in nature see seasonality 
our analysis of our financial results begins under results of operations 
we have been active in developing and expanding our shopping center portfolio  and we describe the most recent center openings  including the pier and northlake  under openings  dispositions  and acquisitions 
in  we disposed of our interest in a owned unconsolidated joint venture and we acquired additional interests in two centers in additional efforts to broaden our growth included the formation in of taubman asia  which is the platform for our expansion into the asia pacific region 
in january  we completed an agreement to provide development services for a project in new songdo city  incheon  south korea and were selected as the preferred retail partner for a project in macao see subsequent events 
we similarly have been very active in managing our balance sheet  completing a series of new financings and refinancings of existing debt  as well as a series of stock buybacks  as outlined under debt transactions and equity transactions 
as a result of our financings  our floating rate debt represents less than of our total debt and we believe we are well positioned if there is a rise in interest rates 
we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenue from management  leasing  and development services 
we disclose the operating partnership s share of these sources of income under other income 
included in other revenue are lease cancellation income  as well as other sources of revenue derived from our shopping centers  such as parking garage and sponsorship income 
other sources of income include interest income and gains on peripheral land sales 
we then provide a discussion of our critical accounting policies  the impact of adoption of new accounting principles  and the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
with all the preceding information as background  we have then provided insight and explanations for variances in our financial results from through under comparison of to and comparison of to 
as information useful to understanding our results  we have described the presentation of our minority interest  the presentation of certain interests in centers  and the reasons for our use of non gaap measures such as ebitda and funds from operations ffo under presentation of operating results 
reconciliations from net income and net income allocable to common shareowners to these measures follow the annual comparisons 
our discussion of sources and uses of capital resources under liquidity and capital resources begins with a brief overview of capital activities and transactions occurring in analysis of specific operating  investing  and financing activities is then provided in more detail 
cash flows from rents and recoveries  lease cancellation revenue  and recent center openings provide the resources for payments of interest and other operating expenses  leasing costs  and required distributions and dividends 
proceeds from the sale of a property and the completion of a major financing occurring in late  in addition to financings in  created significant liquidity used for the pay off or refinancing of several existing loans and further investment in development properties in specific analysis of our fixed and floating rates and periods of interest rate risk exposure is provided under beneficial interest in debt 
completing our analysis of our exposure to rates are the effects of changes in interest rates on our cash flows and fair values of debt contained under sensitivity analysis 
in conducting our business  we enter into various contractual obligations  including those for debt  capital leases for property improvements  operating leases for land and office space  purchase obligations  and other long term commitments 
detail of these obligations  including expected settlement periods  is contained under contractual obligations 
property level debt represents the largest single class of obligations 
described under loan commitments and guarantees and cash tender agreement are our significant guarantees and commitments 
development of new malls and renovation and expansion of existing malls continues to be a significant use of our capital  as described in capital spending and planned capital spending 
recent spending includes that related to the construction of partridge creek  in clinton township  michigan  the expansion and renovation of twelve oaks and waterside  the renovation of the former filene s space at stamford town center  our oyster bay project in the town of oyster bay  new york  and other development activities and capital items 
additional capital spending in is expected to continue for these and other projects 
dividends and distributions are also significant uses of our capital resources 
the factors considered when determining the amount of our dividends  including requirements arising because of our status as a reit  are described under dividends 
we increased our quarterly dividend by in the fourth quarter of our total return to our shareholders  assuming reinvestment of dividends  was for mall tenant sales and center revenues over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
we believe that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay 
the effects of increases or declines in sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor share that percentage rents represent of total rents approximately five percent in 
however  a sustained trend in sales does impact  either negatively or positively  our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates 
tenant sales trends demonstrated strong growth in  increasing and reaching a new record level of per square foot 
this increase in sales resulted in a significant increase in percentage rent in we believe these improving tenant sales provide us an opportunity to increase rents in the future 
the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales mall tenant sales in thousands of dollars sales per square foot consolidated businesses minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales unconsolidated joint ventures minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales sales per square foot is presented for the comparable centers  including value centers 
rental rates and occupancy as leases have expired in the shopping centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following table contains certain information regarding rentals at the comparable shopping centers average rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures opening base rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures square feet of gla opened consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures closing base rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures square feet of gla closed consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures releasing spread per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures the spread between opening and closing rents may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
rents on stores opening in were generally negotiated in a decreasing sales environment 
in  the releasing spread per square foot of the unconsolidated joint ventures was impacted by the opening of large tenant spaces at certain centers 
additionally  average rents and releasing spreads in were impacted by the consolidation of cherry creek  which is included within the consolidated businesses as of january  prior to that time  cherry creek was included within the unconsolidated joint ventures 
mall tenant leased space  ending occupancy  and average occupancy rates are as follows all centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy comparable centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy occupancy continued to increase during  with ending occupancy increasing to  a increase from in for our comparable centers  ending occupancy was  a increase from in we anticipate continued occupancy growth throughout  with more modest increases in the first half than in the second half of the year 
income from temporary in line tenants  which has become an integral part of our business  continues to augment our income 
temporary tenants  defined as those with lease terms less than months  are not included in occupancy or leased space statistics 
as of december   approximately of space was occupied by temporary tenants 
tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases was in  compared to in  and in seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
additionally  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
included in revenues are gains on sales of peripheral land and lease cancellation income that may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
total th quarter rd quarter nd quarter st quarter in thousands of dollars  except as indicated mall tenant sales revenues and gains on land sales and interest income consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures occupancy ending comparable average comparable ending average leased space comparable all centers because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries  mall tenant occupancy costs the sum of minimum rents  percentage rents  and expense recoveries as a percentage of sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter

lease cancellation revenue is dependent on the overall economy and performance of particular retailers in specific locations and can vary significantly 
gains on peripheral land sales can also vary significantly from year to year  depending on the results of negotiations with tenants  counterparties  and potential purchasers of land  as well as the timing of the transactions 
in  we estimate our share of lease cancellation income to be approximately million to million and gains on land sales to be approximately million to million

subsequent events in january  we assumed full management and leasing responsibility of the pier 
we are in final negotiations to increase our ownership percentage in the center from to see planned capital spending new centers 
also in january  taubman asia completed the development services agreement for a million square foot retail and entertainment complex in new songdo city  incheon  south korea 
the shopping complex is scheduled to open in early  with construction beginning in we have negotiated the opportunity to invest in a portion of the broader project  which will include not only retail  but also office  hotel  and residential uses 
we anticipate finalizing our decision on this investment in in january  we announced our involvement in the retail component of macao studio city on the cotai strip in macao 
taubman asia has signed a term sheet to acquire a minority position in the retail component of the project and will provide development  leasing  and management services  subject to definitive agreements to be completed in the first half of in addition  in january  we announced our involvement as a third party leasing agent for a lifestyle center in the city of north las vegas  nevada 
this is a mixed use project that will include retail  dining  and entertainment of up to million square feet and a residential component consisting of approximately units 
the shopping center will open in late the developer of the residential component is an affiliate of the taubman family 
also in january  we acquired land for future development for million 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures 
some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult  subjective  and or complex judgment  often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
we are required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies 
valuation of shopping centers all properties  including those under construction and or owned by joint ventures  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment of a shopping center owned by consolidated entities would be recognized when the sum of expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the property 
other than temporary impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is recognized when the carrying value is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value  including the results of discontinued cash flow and other valuation techniques 
the expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including anchors and tenants  and expected holding period 
these factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
to the extent an impairment has occurred  the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged against operations 
there were no impairment charges recognized in the periods covered within this annual report 
as of december   the consolidated net book value of our properties was billion  representing over of our consolidated assets 
we also have varying ownership percentages in the properties of unconsolidated joint ventures with a total combined net book value of billion 
these amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows 
capitalization of development costs in developing shopping centers  we typically obtain land or land options  zoning and regulatory approvals  anchor commitments  and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which we may incur significant costs 
we capitalize all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion 
prior to this time  we expense all costs relating to a potential development  including payroll  and include these costs in funds from operations see presentation of operating results 
many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond our control  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  availability and cost of financing  changes in regulations  laws  and zoning  and decisions made by third parties  including anchors 
these factors could cause our assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change 
if a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion  a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur 
our approximately million balance of development pre construction costs as of december  consists primarily of costs relating to our oyster bay project in the town of oyster bay  new york 
see liquidity and capital resources planned capital spending regarding the status of this project 
valuation of accounts receivable rents and expense recoveries from tenants are our principal source of income  they represent over of our revenues 
in generating this income  we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
the collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies  changes in the economy  and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements 
while we estimate potentially uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
also  if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement  receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations 
bad debt expense was less than of total revenues in  while bankruptcy filings affected of tenant leases during the year 
since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
valuation of deferred tax assets our taxable reit subsidiaries trss currently have deferred tax assets  reflecting net operating loss carryforwards and the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the bases of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws 
our temporary differences primarily relate to deferred compensation and depreciation 
we reduce our deferred tax assets through valuation allowances to the amount where realization is more likely than not assured  considering all available evidence  including expected future taxable earnings and potential tax planning strategies 
expected future taxable earnings and the implementation of tax planning strategies require certain significant judgments and estimates  including those relating to our management company s profitability  the timing and amounts of gains on land sales  the profitability of our asian operations  and other factors affecting the results of operations of our trss 
changes in any of these factors could cause our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets to change materially 
as of december   we had a consolidated gross deferred tax asset of million  reduced to a net deferred tax asset of million by a valuation allowance of million 
valuations for acquired property and intangibles upon acquisition of an investment property  including that of an additional interest in an asset already partially owned  we make an assessment of the valuation and composition of assets and liabilities acquired 
these assessments consider fair values of the respective assets and liabilities and are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other commonly accepted valuation techniques 
the estimated future cash flows that are used for this analysis reflect the historical operations of the property  known trends and changes expected in current market and economic conditions which would impact the property s operations  and our plans for such property 
these estimates of cash flows and valuations are particularly important given the application of fasb statement nos 
and for the allocation of purchase price between land  building and improvements  and other identifiable intangibles 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in adoption of staff accounting bulletin no 
in september  the securities and exchange commission published staff accounting bulletin no 
sab considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
the interpretations in sab express the sec s staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
the staff s interpretations resulted from their awareness of a diversity in practice as to how the effect of prior year errors were considered in relation to current year financial statements 
through sab  the staff communicated its belief that allowing prior year errors to remain unadjusted on the balance sheet is not in the best interest of the users of financial statements 
sab became effective for us in the fourth quarter of in adopting sab  we changed our method of evaluating financial statement misstatements from a rollover income statement oriented approach to sab s dual method both an income statement and balance sheet oriented approach 
in doing so  we identified three misstatements previously considered immaterial to all previous periods under the rollover method but material when evaluated together under the dual method  as described below 
these misstatements were corrected upon adoption of sab accounting for cherry creek shopping center ground rent prior to prior to  cherry creek  a venture previously accounted for under the equity method  recognized ground rentals under its year ground lease on a cash basis instead of the straightline method required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
this error resulted in us overstating our cumulative equity in the net income of cherry creek by a total of million from our acquisition of an interest in the operating partnership through december  the maximum misstatement of our equity in the net income of cherry creek in any individual year in this period under the rollover method was million 
we began consolidating cherry creek on january  as a result of adopting eitf as a result of the correction of the above error  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle upon adoption of eitf  assets  and liabilities recognized upon the consolidation of cherry creek were increased by million  million and million  respectively 
prior to  we accounted for our investment in cherry creek under the equity method 
recognition of payroll costs we previously recognized our payroll costs in a manner that corresponded to our biweekly pay periods  which do not necessarily end on the last day of the calendar year 
differences caused by not strictly recognizing payroll on a calendar year basis  while previously adjusted on a periodic basis  have resulted in overstatements of net income by a total of million over the last decade  with the maximum misstatement in any individual year computed under the rollover method being million 
arizona mills in  the mills corporation mills  which manages our unconsolidated joint venture  arizona mills  advised us that mills had identified errors in prior year financial statements  primarily relating to the timing of writeoffs of tenant allowances  that relate to years prior to we have not yet received audited financial statements for any period after from mills and amounts identified as errors may change as a result of the eventual completion of the arizona mills audit 
however  based on the information we have received from mills  we have determined that the cumulative impact of our share of prior years errors identified by mills to date is an overstatement of our equity by million 
cumulative effect of adoption of sab as a result of applying the guidance in sab  during the year ended december   we recorded a million reduction to our shareholders equity account dividends in excess of net income in our opening balance sheet to correct for the effect of the errors associated with the accounting for cherry creek s ground rent prior to  the recognition of payroll costs  and our share of arizona mills s errors identified by mills  described above 
adoption of eitf under guidance in eitf determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights and statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures sop as amended by fasb staff position and the corresponding changes and considerations surrounding control  we began consolidating the entity that owns cherry creek as of january  this entity was previously accounted for under the equity method in accordance with the provisions of sop as of january   the impact to the balance sheet was an increase in assets of approximately million and liabilities of approximately million  and a million reduction of beginning equity representing the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements 
this staff position requires companies that agree to register securities recognize a liability if a payment to investors for failing to fulfill the agreement is probable and its amount can be reasonably estimated 
this staff position is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this staff position will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  except for share based payments transactions under fasb statement no 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  as statement no 
does not require any new fair value measurements or remeasurements of previously computed fair values  we not believe adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation defines a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
presentation of operating results the following tables contain the operating results of our consolidated businesses and the unconsolidated joint ventures 
income allocated to the minority partners in the operating partnership and preferred interests is deducted to arrive at the results allocable to our common shareowners 
because the net equity of the operating partnership is less than zero  the income allocated to the minority partners is equal to their share of distributions 
the net equity of these minority partners is less than zero due to accumulated distributions in excess of net income and not as a result of operating losses 
distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income includes non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
amounts allocable to minority partners in certain consolidated joint ventures are added back or deducted to arrive at our net results 
our average ownership percentage of the operating partnership was in  in  and in the results of cherry creek are presented within the consolidated businesses for periods beginning january   as a result of our adoption of eitf the results of international plaza are presented within the consolidated businesses for periods beginning july   as a result of our acquisition of a controlling interest in the center 
prior to the respective adoption date and acquisition date  these centers are included within the unconsolidated joint ventures 
the accounts of the pier  which opened in june  are included within the unconsolidated joint ventures beginning in as of december   we have a million investment in the pier 
the joint venture partner has guaranteed of the outstanding construction loan and is responsible for funding the completion of development and initial leasing costs of the center and all operating requirements of the center prior to stabilization of the center 
prior year information for which errors were identified and corrected through an adjustment of beginning january  shareholders equity pursuant to sab has not been adjusted 
use of non gaap measures the operating results in the following tables include the supplemental earnings measures of beneficial interest in ebitda and funds from operations ffo 
beneficial interest in ebitda represents the operating partnership s share of the earnings before interest and depreciation and amortization  excluding gains on sales of depreciated operating properties of its consolidated and unconsolidated businesses 
we believe beneficial interest in ebitda provides a useful indicator of operating performance  as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of reits 
we primarily use ffo in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation 
our presentations of ebitda and ffo are not necessarily comparable to the similarly titled measures of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definitions 
these measures should not be considered alternatives to net income loss or as an indicator of our operating performance 
additionally  neither represents cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reconciliations of net income loss allocable to common shareowners to funds from operations and net income to beneficial interest in ebitda are presented following the comparison of to see the following section regarding certain presentation changes affecting ebitda and ffo 
presentation changes as previously reported for  because of a change in our business practice to offer our tenants the option to pay a fixed charge or pay their share of common area maintenance cam costs and the related change to contractual terms of leases  we began adding back in the fourth quarter of all depreciation on cam assets to calculate ebitda and ffo 
additionally  we have reclassified depreciation on cam assets from recoverable expenses to depreciation and amortization expense for all periods presented 
also  as a result of this change in our business practice  we modified our estimated useful lives of cam assets that are recoverable from tenants as of january  the change in useful lives better aligns the depreciation of common area assets with our lease portfolio 
the change in estimate did not have a material effect on the current results of operations but could be material in future periods 
the operating partnership s share of depreciation on cam capital expenditures was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
during  we began recognizing revenue for marketing and promotion services at the gross amount billed to tenants  rather than a net amount retained that is  the amount billed to the tenants less the related costs incurred 
revenues are now included in recoveries from tenants and the related expenses in other operating expense 
this presentation change was made as a result of our recent offering to tenants of an option to pay fixed amounts for marketing and promotion of the shopping centers 
in evaluating the accounting for marketing and promotion services  we considered that there may no longer be a direct relationship between tenant billings and the marketing and promotion costs incurred  as well as the fact that we are the primary obligor on the costs incurred 
historically  revenues from marketing and promotion services have been equal to costs incurred 
in addition  we now separately present gains on peripheral land sales and interest income in the income statement following revenues and expenses 
prior year revenues and expenses in the following tables have been reclassified as described above to be consistent with the presentation

consolidated businesses total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a million or increase over minimum rents increased million  primarily due to cherry creek  which we began consolidating in upon our adoption of eitf  and the september opening of northlake 
minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers

expense recoveries increased primarily due to cherry creek and northlake  and increases in recoverable costs 
management  leasing  and development revenue decreased primarily due to a reduction in reimbursable third party costs  offset by increased revenues related to services from certain contracts

general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increases in compensation expenses  including bonus expense and the mark to market of long term grants that fluctuate with our stock price  which were partially offset by decreased severance costs 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will be approximately million for each quarter of interest expense increased due to cherry creek  northlake  the higher balance on the refinancing of short hills  and increases in floating interest rates

at a 
alfred taubman s election  his family  and certain others may participate in tenders 
we will have the option to pay for these interests from available cash  borrowed funds  or from the proceeds of an offering of our common stock

based on a market value at december  of per common share  the aggregate value of interests in the operating partnership that may be tendered under the cash tender agreement was approximately billion 
the purchase of these interests at december  would have resulted in our owning an additional interest in the operating partnership
