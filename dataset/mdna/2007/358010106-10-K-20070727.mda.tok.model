item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of this backlog is expected to be filled during the company s fiscal year ending april  the backlog  which reflects only firm purchase orders and contracts  is subject to change by reason of several factors including possible cancellation of orders  change orders  terms of the contracts and other factors beyond the company s control 
accordingly  the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the revenues or profits losses which may be realized when the results of such contracts are reported 
customers and suppliers the company markets its products both directly and through approximately independent sales representative organizations located in the united states  europe and asia 
sales to non us customers  including the revenues of its overseas subsidiaries  totaled approximately  and of net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company s products are sold to both commercial and governmental customers 
for the years ended april   and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s sales were made under contracts to the us government or subcontracts for us government end use 
the company s consolidated sales for each of the years ended april  and included sales to motorola corp 
motorola  alcatel lucent lucent and space systems loral ss l  each of which accounted for greater than of consolidated sales 
in fiscal year  motorola and lucent each accounted for greater than of consolidated sales 
in the aggregate  for fiscal years and these three customers accounted for and  respectively  of consolidated sales 
in fiscal year motorola and lucent accounted for an aggregate of of consolidated sales 
in fiscal years and  revenues from these three companies accounted for an aggregate of and of the company s fei ny segment 
in fiscal year  motorola and lucent accounted for an aggregate of of that segment s sales 
during fiscal years  and  france telecom and belgacom were major customers of the gillam fei segment 
these european telecommunication companies accounted for an aggregate of  and  respectively  of the segment s revenues in those fiscal years 
in the fei zyfer segment  during fiscal year  computer sciences corporation csc and si international accounted for an aggregate of of the segment s revenues  in fiscal year  csc and l communications accounted for of revenues and in fiscal year  northrop grumman corporation and csc accounted for an aggregate of of revenues 
none of the customers in the gillam fei or fei zyfer segments accounted for more than of consolidated revenues 
the loss by the company of any one of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company believes its relationship with these companies to be mutually satisfactory and is not aware of any prospect for the cancellation or significant reduction of any of its commercial or existing us government contracts 
the company purchases a variety of components such as transistors  resistors  capacitors  connectors and diodes for use in the manufacture of its products 
the company is not dependent upon any one supplier or source of supply for any of its component part purchases and maintains alternative sources of supply for all of its purchased components 
the company has found its suppliers generally to be reliable and price competitive 
research and development the company s technological expertise continues to be an important factor to support future growth in revenues and earnings 
the company has focused its internal research and development efforts on improving the core physics and electronic packages in its time and frequency products  conducting research to develop new time and frequency technologies  improving product manufacturability by seeking to reduce its production costs through product redesign and process improvements and other measures to take advantage of lower cost components 
the company continues to focus a significant portion of its own resources and efforts on developing hardware for satellite commercial and us government and terrestrial commercial communications systems  including wireless  wireline and gps related systems 
during fiscal years  and  the company expended million  million and million of its own funds  respectively  on such research and development activity 
see also item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for fiscal year  the company is targeting to spend between million and million on research and development in similar areas 
the actual amount spent will depend on market conditions and identification of new opportunities 
patents and licenses the company believes that its business is generally not dependent on patent or license protection 
rather  it is primarily dependent upon the company s technical competence  the quality of its products and its prompt and responsible contract performance 
however  employees working for the company assign all rights to inventions to the company and the company presently holds such patents and licenses 
in certain limited circumstances  the us government may use or permit the use by the company s competitors of certain patents or licenses the government has funded 
during fiscal year  the company received a broad and significant patent for new  proprietary quartz oscillator technology which the company intends to exploit in both legacy and new applications 
in  the company obtained a basic patent for its low g technology 
competition the company experiences competition in all areas of its business 
the company competes primarily on the basis of the accuracy  performance and reliability of its products  the ability of its products to function under severe conditions  such as in space or other extreme hostile environments  prompt and responsive contract performance  technical competence and price 
the company has a unique and broad product line which includes all three frequency standards quartz  rubidium  and cesium 
because of the very high precision of certain of its products  the company has few competitors 
for lower precision components there is significant competition from a number of suppliers 
in recent years  the company has successfully outsourced certain component manufacturing processes to third parties and more recently to its wholly owned subsidiary  fei asia in tianjin  china and to russian based morion  inc  in which the company is a minority shareholder 
the company expects this outsourcing to enhance its competitive position on cost while maintaining its high quality standards 
the company believes its ability to obtain raw materials  manufacture finished products  integrate them into systems and sub systems and interface these systems with end user applications provides a strong competitive advantage 
certain of the company s competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have larger research and development and marketing staffs 
the company has a strong history of competing successfully in this environment due to the quality  reliability and outstanding record of performance its products have achieved 
with respect to its instruments and systems for timing and synchronization  the company competes with agilent technologies  symmetricom  inc  e 
g 
and g  inc  vectron  inc 
and others

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k and the exhibits hereto  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company s business 
additional risks not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect its business  financial condition  or results of operations 
a variety of factors may cause the price of the company s stock to be volatile 
in recent years  the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology companies in particular  including frequency electronics  have experienced price fluctuations 
for example  for fiscal year  the price of the company s common stock ranged from a closing high of to a closing low of 
the market price of the company s common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  including fluctuations unrelated to its performance 
the company believes that fluctuations of its stock price may be caused by a variety of factors  including fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new commercial products or other developments by the company or its competitors  published reports by securities analysts  general market conditions  general economic conditions  announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  the company s cash position and cash commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sales or purchases of the company s common stock in the marketplace  an outbreak of hostilities  diseases  natural disasters or terrorism  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights  and developments in the company s relationships with customers and suppliers 
if the company fails to keep pace with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards  its products could become less competitive or obsolete 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
the company may cease to be competitive if it fails to timely introduce new products or product enhancements that address these factors 
to continue to introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis  the company must identify emerging technological trends in the company s target markets  accurately define and design new products or product enhancements to meet market needs  develop or license the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and product enhancements  and respond effectively to technological changes and product introductions by the company s competitors 
if the company fails to timely identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  its competitors could gain market share or its new or enhanced products might not gain market acceptance 
delays in the development of new or enhanced products could harm the company s operating results and its competitive position 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  highly skilled engineering and development personnel and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
consequently  product development delays are typical in the company s industry 
if the company fails to timely introduce a product for an emerging standard or customers defer or cancel orders expecting the release of a new or enhanced product  its operating results could suffer 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing product specifications and customer requirements  unanticipated engineering complexities  difficulties with or delays by contract manufacturers or suppliers of key components or technologies  difficulties in allocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  and difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel 
the company faces uncertainty relating to economic conditions affecting its customers 
the company faces uncertainty in the degree to which the current global economic climate will affect the rate of growth for its existing and potential customers 
in particular  the timing and magnitude of capital spending by international telecommunications companies  including those in china  will materially impact the company s business 
frequency electronics may experience instances of customers delaying or deferring orders and longer lead times to close sales 
similarly  spending on us government programs is determined by the annual defense department budget 
to the extent that support for the liberation and rebuilding of iraq takes precedence  funding for certain department of defense programs may be delayed or significantly reduced in the near term 
such delays can have a materially negative impact on the company s business  its operating results and financial condition 
the company faces competition 
its inability to remain competitive in the industry would adversely affect the company s ability to maintain its current sales and growth 
the company experiences competition in all areas of its business 
frequency electronics competes primarily on the basis of the accuracy  performance and reliability of its products  the ability of its products to function under severe conditions  such as in space or other extreme hostile environments  prompt and responsive contract performance  technical competence and price 
the company has a unique and broad product line which includes all three frequency standards quartz  rubidium  and cesium 
for its high precision products  the company has few competitors  but for lower precision components  the company faces significant competition from a number of suppliers 
certain of the company s competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have larger research and development and marketing staffs 
if its competitors develop more accurate or reliable products  or otherwise improve their products  frequency electronics could experience a decline in its sales or loss of market acceptance of its products 
with respect to the company s instruments and systems  it competes with agilent technologies  symmetricom  inc  e 
g 
and g  inc  vectron  inc and others 
systems for the wireline industry produced by the gillam fei segment compete with symmetricom  inc and oscilloquartz  a division of swatch 
frequency electronics principal competition for space products is the in house capability of its major customers 
the company s reliance on third parties could materially adversely affect its business 
in recent years  the company has outsourced certain component manufacturing processes to third parties and more recently to its wholly owned subsidiary  fei asia in tianjin  china and to russian based morion  inc  in which the company is a minority shareholder 
the company expects this outsourcing to enhance its competitive position on cost while maintaining its high quality standards 
any unanticipated changes in such third parties ability to perform the component manufacturing processes or any delay in such manufacturing could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to its business 
the company s future success is dependent upon the contributions of its senior corporate management team  particularly martin bloch  president and chief executive officer  who has been with the company since  markus hechler  executive vice president  who has been with the company since  oleandro mancini  vice president of business development  who has been with the company since and certain other key employees 
if messrs 
bloch  hechler and mancini no longer serve in their positions  the company s business  financial conditions and results of operation could be substantially adversely affected 
the company s future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management  manufacturing  technical  engineering  marketing  sales and support personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the company cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel 
there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for the company to hire personnel over time 
the company s business  financial conditions and results of operation could be substantially adversely affected by its inability to attract and retain skilled employees 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect sales 
because the company sells its products worldwide  its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
the company recognized of its revenue from sales to end users in countries located outside of the united states in the fiscal year ended april  the company anticipates that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of its revenue 
in addition  several of the company s manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the united states of america 
accordingly  the company s future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  tariff and trade policies  export license requirements and restrictions of the export of technology  import regulations  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  ongoing health epidemics eg  bird flu  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  stability of international monetary conditions  differing labor regulations  political unrest  war  actual or threatened acts of terrorism  other international conflicts and the resulting military  economic and political responses including  without limitation  war between sovereign nations as well as heightened security measures which may cause significant disruption to commerce worldwide  differing protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
the company s products may contain defects that cause it to incur significant corrective costs  divert its attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers 
highly complex products such as the company s high technology frequency  timing and synchronization products may contain defects when they are installed in its customers systems 
if any of the company s products contain defects or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  its reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy its products 
in addition  these defects could interrupt or delay sales 
the company may have to invest significant capital and other resources to alleviate these problems 
if any problem remains undiscovered until after the company has commenced production of a new product  it may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against the company by its customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert the company s technical and other resources from other development efforts 
if the company fails to manage its operations effectively  its business could suffer 
the company s ability to offer products and implement its business plan successfully in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning and management 
failure by the company s management or personnel to properly allocate resources to meet its current and existing needs as well as unforeseen complications and inefficiencies in planning its operations can adversely impact the morale of the company s personnel and lead to further complications and operational inefficiencies 
if this were to occur  the company s profitability or financial position could be negatively impacted and its operating results could suffer 
claims that the company infringed third party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on its ability to sell its products 
although the company s industry is not characterized by frequent claims or litigation regarding patent rights  the company cannot be certain that its products do not or will not infringe issued patents or the intellectual property rights of others 
historically  patent applications in the united states of america have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  and the company may not be aware of filed patent applications that relate to its products or technology 
if patents are later issued in connection with these applications  the company may be liable for infringement 
periodically  other parties  including some of the company s competitors  may assert patent  copyright and other rights to technologies in various jurisdictions that are important to its business 
any claims asserting that the company s products infringe or may infringe the rights of third parties  including claims arising through its contractual indemnification of its customers  regardless of their merit or resolution  would likely be costly and time consuming  divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
at present  the company does not believe that its products infringe any other party s intellectual property rights in any way that would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
however  if any material claims do arise and if these claims cannot be resolved through a license or similar arrangement  the company could become a party to litigation 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with third parties that could arise in the future  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  including treble damages if it is held to have willfully infringed  to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or to obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention from the company s business 
any failure to protect the company s intellectual property adequately may significantly harm its business 
the company protects its proprietary processes  software  know how and other intellectual property and related rights through copyrights  patents  trademarks and the maintenance of trade secrets  including entering into confidentiality agreements 
the company s success and ability to compete depends in part on its proprietary technology 
however  the company cannot provide any assurance that other companies will not develop technologies that are similar to its technology 
although the company has patent applications pending  patents may not issue as a result of these or other patent applications 
any patents that ultimately issue may be successfully challenged or invalidated  or may not provide the company with a significant competitive advantage 
despite the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights  existing laws in the united states of america and in differing international jurisdictions and its contractual arrangements provide only limited protection 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s products or technology 
third parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other protective contracts with the company and it may not be able to enforce its rights in the event of these breaches 
monitoring unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult and may be expensive  and the company cannot be certain that the steps it has taken will prevent unauthorized use of its intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect the company s proprietary rights as fully as in the united states of america 
the company may be required to spend significant resources to protect its intellectual property rights  including pursuing remedies in court 
frequency electronics may become involved in legal proceedings against other parties  which may also cause other parties to assert claims against it 
in the future the company may not be able to detect infringements and may lose its competitive position in its markets before it does so 
in addition  competitors may design around the company s technologies or develop competing technologies 
the laws of other countries in which the company markets its products might offer little or no effective protection of its proprietary technology 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of the company s proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from its technology without payment  which could significantly harm the company s business 
the company s failure to enforce and protect its intellectual property rights or any adverse change in the laws protecting intellectual property rights could harm its business 
furthermore  the company may become involved in legal proceedings against other parties  which may also cause other parties to assert claims against it 
future sales of substantial amounts of the company s common stock by it or by its existing stockholders could cause the company s stock price to fall 
additional equity financings or other share issuances by the company could adversely affect the market price of its common stock 
sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of frequency electronics common stock in the public trading market or in private transactions such as offerings by selling stockholders under the form s filed in february  or the perception that such additional sales could occur  could cause the market price of the company s common stock to drop 
some of the company s revenue is generated from a limited number of key customers and the loss of a key customer could substantially reduce its revenues 
a large portion of the company s sales are generated from a small number of key customers at each of the company s segments  including  without limitation  three customers of the fei ny segment  space systems loral  lucent technologies and motorola corp  which together accounted for of consolidated sales for fiscal in fiscal year  france telecom and belgacom were significant customers of the company s gillam fei segment  and computer sciences corporation and si international were significant customers of the fei zyfer segment 
the company s top customers accounted for of its consolidated sales for fiscal year the company expects that its top customers in the aggregate will continue to account for a large portion of its consolidated sales in the foreseeable future  and the loss of one or more of these customers would materially harm the company s business and operating results 
the loss of a key customer could also be perceived as a loss of momentum in the company s business and an adverse impact on its financial results  and this may cause the market price of the company s common stock to fall 
the company is subject to anti takeover provisions that could delay or prevent an acquisition of the company the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of frequency electronics 
these factors could materially adversely affect the price of the company s common stock

by making these forward looking statements  the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue and costs on production contracts and the valuation of inventory 
each of these areas requires the company to make use of reasonable estimates including estimating the cost to complete a contract  the realizable value of its inventory or the market value of its products 
changes in estimates can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues under larger  long term contracts which generally require billings based on achievement of milestones rather than delivery of product  are reported in operating results using the percentage of completion method 
on fixed price contracts  which are typical for commercial and us government satellite programs and other long term us government projects  and which require initial design and development of the product  revenue is recognized on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs bear to total estimated contract costs with related cost of sales recorded as the costs are incurred 
each month management reviews estimated contract costs 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in revenues in the period in which the change is known 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
on production type orders  revenue is recorded as units are delivered with the related cost of sales recognized on each shipment based upon a percentage of estimated final program costs 
changes in job performance may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined to be required 
provisions for anticipated losses on customer orders are made in the period in which they become determinable 
for customer orders in the company s gillam fei and fei zyfer segments or smaller contracts or orders in the other business segments  sales of products and services to customers are reported in operating results based upon i shipment of the product or ii performance of the services pursuant to terms of the customer order 
when payment is contingent upon customer acceptance of the installed system  revenue is deferred until such acceptance is received and installation completed 
costs and expenses contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs  manufacturing overhead and other direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory in accordance with industry practice  inventoried costs contain amounts relating to contracts and programs with long production cycles  a portion of which will not be realized within one year 
inventory reserves are established for slow moving and obsolete items and are based upon management s experience and expectations for future business 
any changes in reserves arising from revised expectations are reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
equity based compensation effective may   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost of  was recognized during the year ended april   and includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
upon adoption of fas r  the company elected to continue to value its share based payment transactions using the black scholes valuation model  which was previously used by the company for purposes of preparing the pro forma disclosures under fas such value is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period  net of estimated forfeitures 
this is the same attribution method that was used by the company for purposes of its pro forma disclosures under fas at april   unrecognized compensation cost for all the company s stock based compensation awards was approximately million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  the company applied the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission in march in its adoption of fas r 
sab requires stock based compensation to be classified in the same expense line items as cash compensation 
accordingly  during the year ended april   stock based compensation expense was  in cost of sales and  in selling  general and administrative expense 
prior to the adoption of fas r  the company presented all tax benefits resulting from tax deductions associated with the exercise of stock options by employees as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
under fas r excess tax benefits are to be classified as cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
for this purpose  the excess tax benefits are tax benefits related to the difference between the total tax deduction associated with the exercise of stock options by employees and the amount of compensation cost recognized for those options 
for the year ended april   there were no excess tax benefits to be included within other financing activities of the cash flows from financing activities pursuant to this requirement of fas r 
effect of adoption of fas r the application of fas r had the following effect on the reported amounts for the year ended april   relative to amounts that would have been reported using the intrinsic value method under previous accounting in thousands  except for per share amounts 
using intrinsic fas r as value method adjustments reported operating loss loss before benefit for income taxes net income loss basic earnings loss per share diluted earnings loss per share the weighted average fair value of each option has been estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in each of the years ended april   and dividend yield of   and  expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of   and  and expected lives of six and one half years  respectively 
the expected life assumption was determined based on the company s historical experience 
for purposes of both fas and fas r  the expected volatility assumption was based on the historical volatility of the company s common stock 
the dividend yield assumption was determined based upon the company s past history of dividend payments and its intention to make future dividend payments 
the risk free interest rate assumption was determined using the implied yield currently available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock options 
fiscal years and through fiscal year  the company applied the disclosure only provisions of fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and continued to measure compensation cost in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
historically  this did not result in compensation cost upon the grant of options under a qualified stock option plan 
however  in accordance with fas no 
 the company provided pro forma disclosures of net income loss and income loss per share as if the fair value method had been applied beginning in fiscal the following table illustrates the effect on the company s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april  had compensation cost for stock option awards under the plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates consistent with the provisions of fas no 
in thousands  except per share data net income  as reported cost of stock options  net of taxes net income pro forma income per share  as reported basic diluted income per share pro forma basic diluted the weighted average fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in each of the two years ended april  and  dividend yield of and  expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of and  and expected lives of six and one half years  respectively 
results of operations the table below sets forth for the fiscal years ended april the percentage of consolidated net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations net sales fei ny gillam fei fei zyfer less intersegment sales cost of sales gross margin selling and administrative expenses compensation charges research and development expenses operating loss profit other income  net minority interest benefit provision for income taxes net loss income significant events operating results for fiscal year have been impacted by several major satellite payload programs 
revenues from space related programs increased year over year but higher than anticipated engineering costs resulted in lower gross margin and in higher research and development spending  which yielded an operating loss for the year ended april  as described elsewhere in this form k and in the notes to the financial statements  the company s fiscal year and results of operations were materially impacted by several specific events 
during fiscal year  the company recorded a gain of million on the conversion of its real estate operating partnership units reit units into shares of reckson associates realty corp 
common stock reit stock  thus completing a transaction which was initiated in fiscal year see item properties  note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and comments in the following paragraph 
subsequent to the conversion  the company sold a portion of the reit stock and realized additional gains of approximately million  or total pretax gains of approximately million 
as a result of these gains  the company also accrued a contractually mandated incentive compensation expense of  which amount is included in operating expenses under the caption compensation charges 
during fiscal year  the company recognized gains on the sale of certain assets million from additional sales of shares of reit stock and a gain of  upon the sale of a manufacturing facility owned by one of its european subsidiaries 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
without these significant events  the company s operating profit loss  pre tax income and net income would be materially different from that reported in the financial statements 
net sales fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  in millions change change fei ny gillam fei fei zyfer intersegment sales for the year ended april   the revenue increase in the fei ny segment was generated from all sources 
wireless telecommunications related revenues  revenues from satellite payloads for commercial and us government programs  other us government  non space programs and other commercial revenues all increased as compared to the prior fiscal year 
gillam fei revenues in fiscal exclusive of intercompany sales of million in fiscal year and  in fiscal year related to increased inventory for and development efforts expended on the new wireline synchronization product line increased by 
approximately one fourth of the sales increase is attributable to the increased value of the euro compared to the us dollar 
revenues for the fei zyfer segment during fiscal year declined by million as many orders were delayed compared to expectations 
for the year ended april   revenues of the fei ny segment declined primarily as a result of a decrease in revenues related to wireless telecommunication infrastructure spending 
this decline was partially offset by a doubling in revenues from commercial and us government satellite projects 
revenues for gillam fei exclusive of intercompany sales of  in fiscal year and million in fiscal year related to a research and development program decreased by million or  as a number of wireline synchronization projects were postponed by its customers 
fei zyfer continued to show year over year improvement in revenues as the segment introduced new products and continued to solidify its position with its customer base 
during fiscal year  based on current backlog and current proposal activity  the company expects to realize significant revenues from commercial and us government satellite programs 
in addition  the company s recent work on us government sponsored development contracts and current proposal activity should generate increased revenues from us government programs such as secure radios  unmanned aerial vehicles  weapons guidance systems and secure communications 
the timing and magnitude of revenues from these sources is dependent on the us government s procurement and budgeting process 
increased us government spending during fiscal year will benefit the company s fei ny and fei zyfer segment 
similarly  the company s development of state of the art wireline synchronization systems is expected to result in increased bookings and revenues in fiscal year which will benefit both the fei ny and gillam fei segments 
gross margin rates fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  in thousands change change gm rate for the year ended april   gross margin declined both in total and as a percentage of revenues 
this is primarily the result of higher than anticipated engineering costs on certain satellite payload programs 
the company has encountered a significant learning curve in its efforts to increase its production capacity of certain space related assemblies by a factor of during fiscal year  substantial resources were expended to redesign the company s products to meet the specific requirements of two long term contracts 
this process also delayed the completion of these contracts which is now expected to occur in the first quarter of fiscal for the year ended april   gross margin improved by over the prior year even though the level of sales decreased by from fiscal year this result was achieved through better utilization of resources and product mix which was partially offset by developmental and technical issues that the company experienced during fiscal year with respect to the two long term contracts referred to in the preceding paragraph 
the company s target is to achieve an overall gross margin rate of or better through greater sales volume  continued process improvements  better performance on long term contracts and utilization of lower cost manufacturing in russia and china 
during fiscal year  if technical and engineering issues are resolved and revenues increase as anticipated  the company expects to realize gross margin rates approaching its targeted rate 
compensation charges fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  in thousands change change nm nm under the caption compensation charges  the company has recorded certain expenses which are defined as operating expenses which are not expected to recur 
there were no material non recurring expenses in fiscal years and during fiscal year the company accrued a  incentive compensation expense related to the conversion and sale of reit units 
in addition  the company recorded a non cash charge of  to increase the liability under its deferred compensation plan 
this charge was based on updated life expectancy charts utilized by the company s actuary 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company s belgian subsidiary recorded an accrual for  related to litigation with a former employee 
selling and administrative expenses fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  in thousands change change fiscal year selling and administrative costs increased over fiscal year principally from higher compensation expense related to an increase in personnel  normal salary increases  higher deferred compensation expense and partially offset by lower incentive compensation charges due to operating losses recorded during the year 
in addition  included in selling and administrative expense for the year ended april   is  related to stock compensation expense 
due to new accounting requirements  such a charge was not required to be recorded in the statement of operations in the prior years 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended april   selling and administrative costs declined by compared to fiscal year  as a result of lower compensation costs  including incentive compensation charges  reduced deferred compensation expense  lower sales commission expense and substantially reduced fees for professional and consulting services as prior year projects were concluded 
these cost reductions were partially offset by increased recruiting and employee retention expenses 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company targets selling and administrative expenses not to exceed of consolidated sales 
as revenues increase as anticipated in fiscal year  the company expects to achieve its targeted level of selling and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  in thousands change change research and development expenditures represent investments intended to keep the company s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance competitiveness for future sales 
for the year ended april   the substantial increase in r d spending was a direct result of internally funded projects to enhance the company s product offerings for satellite payloads and to design such products for more efficient production 
for the year ended april   research and development expenditures decreased by from the level of spending in fiscal year the decline resulted from decreased spending on development of the new usg wireline synchronization product  which is near completion  but was offset by new initiatives in developing a ruggedized rubidium clock for secure military communications  enhancing and miniaturizing products for wireless communications  upgrading its gps based synchronization product line  and developing enhanced network monitoring equipment and software 
the company will continue to focus its research and development activities on those products which it expects will provide the best return on investment and greatest prospects for the future growth of the company 
for fiscal year  the company will continue to make investments in improved satellite payload products  including manufacturing process improvements  invest in development of improved and miniaturized rubidium atomic clocks  develop new gps based synchronization products and further enhance the capabilities of its line of crystal oscillators 
the company s target is to spend approximately of revenues on research and development activities  although the actual level of spending is dependent on new opportunites and the rate at which it succeeds in bringing new products to market 
internally generated cash and cash reserves will be adequate to fund these development efforts 
operating loss profit fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  in thousands change change nm nm nm not meaningful as discussed above  the operating loss incurred in fiscal year is the result of lower gross margin and higher research and development spending  both of which are due to higher than anticipated engineering costs that were incurred in connection with the company s satellite payload products and programs 
for the fiscal year ended april   the company realized an operating profit of million compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal year this substantial improvement in operating results was the result of several factors including improved gross margins  lower compensation related charges and lower discretionary spending on research and development 
the company expects to realize substantially improved operating profits in fiscal year once the engineering issues on satellite programs have been resolved 
with its increasing backlog  the company expects to report increasing revenues  improve its gross margin and maintain selling and administrative expenses at less than of revenues 
other income expense fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  in thousands change change investment income equity income interest expense other  net with respect to other income and expense  the principal difference between the three fiscal years is the conversion of reit units for reit stock in fiscal year and the subsequent partial sale of these shares in fiscal years and  as described above under significant events 
see item properties and note to the accompanying financial statements 
investment income in both fiscal years and contained gains of million and million  respectively  on the sale of reit stock 
by comparison  in fiscal year the company recorded a net loss of  on the sale of other marketable securities 
investment income also includes interest and dividend income on marketable securities 
income from this source was approximately the same in both fiscal years and but substantially lower than fiscal year since the company no longer receives dividend income from its former investment in reit stock 
the company anticipates that during fiscal year it will realize investment income comparable to fiscal year the primary source of income for this category will be from interest income on its bond portfolio 
the company records equity income or losses from its investments in morion and elcom 
the company acquired a interest on a fully diluted basis in elcom during the third quarter of fiscal year and  during the th quarter of that year  the company recorded its share of elcom s loss for that period 
this loss was offset by the equity income from morion which continued to increase year over year 
the greater than increase in equity income for fiscal year over fiscal year is due to two factors a the increased profitability of morion during the year ended april  compared to the previous year and b in the sixth month of fiscal year the company increased its investment in morion from to of morion s outstanding shares and equity income was recorded at the lower rate for the first five months of that year 
in june  the company s investment in morion was reduced from to of morion s outstanding shares and the company will no longer account for its investment in morion on the equity method 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal year  interest expense was incurred on borrowings under short term credit obligations and on certain deferred compensation obligations 
for the year ended april   interest expense increased over the prior year due to greater utilization of its bank line of credit to cover working capital requirements 
interest expense for the year ended april   decreased from fiscal year as a result of the gain realized on the conversion of reit units to reit stock 
prior to the fiscal year conversion  the financing arrangement for the sale and leaseback of the us manufacturing facility was considered as debt on which interest expense was recorded 
in addition  with the proceeds from the reit stock sale  the company repaid the outstanding balance on its credit line 
the company also recorded lower interest expense on deferred compensation payments due to lower interest rates during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company anticipates that interest expense in fiscal year will be approximately the same as that recorded in fiscal year  depending on the trend in interest rates 
during both fiscal years and  the company recognized  of income from amortization of the deferred gain from the sale of its corporate headquarters building in new york  which income is included in the caption other  net 
the deferred gain is being amortized over the remaining life of the original eleven year lease 
during fiscal year  the company sold the building formerly owned by its french subsidiary 
following the fiscal year staffing cutbacks in this entity  the building had been largely vacant and available for sale 
upon receipt of an independent appraisal  the building was sold to the former president of the company s subsidiary  gillam fei 
the company realized a gain on the sale of the building of approximately  which is included in the caption other  net 
for the year ended april   other  net includes a million gain on the conversion of the reit units to reit stock 
see item properties and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this gain was offset by certain recurring  non operating expenses 
in future fiscal years  other  net will include annual amortization into income of the final  deferred gain on the sale of its building 
using the straightline method over the remaining months of the initial leaseback period  the company will recognize approximately  of amortized income during fiscal year the company anticipates that in future years other items in this category will not be significant to pretax earnings 
income taxes the company is subject to taxation in several countries 
the statutory federal rates are in the united states and in europe 
due to the tax benefit to be derived from carrying forward the current year tax loss and unapplied tax credits as well as the reversal of a portion of a reserve on foreign taxes  the effective tax benefit rate in fiscal year is greater than 
the effective rate for the company for the year ended april  was  compared to in fiscal year the effective rate is also impacted by the income or loss of certain of the company s european and asian subsidiaries as well as the equity income from its investments which are currently not taxed 
the company may commence tax payments in china during calendar based on the operating profits of its subsidiary  fei asia 
the company utilizes the availability of research and development tax credits in the united states to lower its tax rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s european subsidiaries have available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
these loss carryforwards have no expiration date 
the operating loss carryforwards for the us subsidiaries of the company are approximately  and these expire in years 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect a highly liquid position with working capital of million at april  included in working capital at april  is million consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments but offset by million in borrowings under its bank line of credit 
the company s current ratio at april  is to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended april   was million compared to cash used in operations of million in fiscal year the primary causes for the decrease in cash was the operating loss generated by higher operating expenses and a increase in inventory to enable the company to respond to existing and anticipated customer orders 
in fiscal year  the primary cause for the decrease in cash was the payment of approximately million in income taxes on non operating gains recorded at the end of fiscal year this payment was deferred in the prior year  contributing to positive operating cash flow in fiscal year also impacting operating cash flow is the timing of certain milestone billings under long term contracts 
in recent years  a higher percentage of revenue has been recognized under long term contract accounting by which the company recognizes revenues at different intervals than the billings mandated by the respective contracts 
included in accounts receivable are amounts for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts accounted for on the percentage of completion basis 
see note to the accompanying financial statements 
in fiscal year  the company anticipates that it will generate positive cash flow from operations as certain long term contracts are completed and higher engineering costs abate

in fiscal year  the company established a million line of credit with the financial institution which also manages a substantial portion of its investment in marketable securities 
in early fiscal year  the company increased this line to million 
the line is secured by the investments which earn  on average  approximately a annual return 
rather than liquidate some of these investments to meet short term working capital requirements  during fiscal years  and  the company borrowed million  million and million  respectively against the line of credit at fixed and variable interest rates between and 
the company must annually repay any borrowings under the line of credit on their anniversary date but may also obtain new funding up to the credit limit

the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab in september sab expresses the views of the sec staff regarding the process of quantifying the materiality of financial misstatements 
sab requires both the balance sheet iron curtain and income statement rollover approaches be used when quantifying the materiality of misstatement amounts 
in addition  sab contains guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach and provides transition guidance for correcting errors existing in prior years 
sab is now effective for the company and  for the fiscal year ended april   there was no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements from application of this bulletin

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and market values of securities 
the company s investments in fixed income and equity securities were million and  respectively  at april  the investments are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  recorded as adjustments to stockholders equity 
the fair value of investments in marketable securities is generally based on quoted market prices 
typically  the fair market value of investments in fixed interest rate debt securities will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at april   a change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed income securities or results of operations investment income 
foreign currency risk with its investment in gillam fei and fei asia  the company is subject to foreign currency translation risk 
for each of these investments  the company does not have any near term intentions to repatriate its invested cash 
for this reason  the company does not intend to initiate any exchange rate hedging strategies which could be used to mitigate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations will be recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income 
as of april   the amount related to foreign currency exchange rates is a  unrealized gain 
the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars  will reflect the average rates of exchange for the periods presented 
as a result  similar results in local currency can vary significantly upon translation into us dollars if exchange rates fluctuate significantly from one period to the next
