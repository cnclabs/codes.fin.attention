item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview carbo ceramics inc generates revenue primarily through the sale of products and services to the oil and gas industry 
the company conducts its business within two operating segments proppant and fracture and reservoir diagnostics 
the company s principal business  the proppant segment  consists of manufacturing and selling ceramic proppant for use primarily in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
through its fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment  the company provides fracture mapping and reservoir diagnostic services  sells fracture simulation software and provides engineering services to oil and gas companies worldwide 
these services and software are provided through the company s wholly owned subsidiary pinnacle technologies  inc the company s products and services help oil and gas producers increase production and recovery rates from their wells  thereby lowering overall reservoir development costs 
as a result  the company s business is dependent to a large extent on the level of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry worldwide 
however  the company has increased its revenues and income over an extended period and across various industry business cycles by increasing its share of the worldwide market for all types of proppant 
while the company s ceramic proppants are more expensive than alternative non ceramic proppants  the company has been able to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of its products to numerous operators of oil and gas wells through increased technical marketing activity 
the company believes its future prospects will benefit from both an expected increase in drilling activity worldwide and the desire of industry participants to improve production results and lower their overall development costs 
in recent years  the company has expanded its operations outside the united states 
in the company constructed its first manufacturing facility located outside the united states in the city of luoyang  china and completed a second production line in that doubled the capacity of that facility 
in  the company also opened a sales office in moscow  russia  and established distribution operations in the country 
in  the company broke ground on a new manufacturing facility in the city of kopeysk  russia and expects that facility to 
table of contents reach completion in the first quarter of the company believes international operations will continue to represent an important role in its future growth 
revenue growth in recent years has been driven largely by increases in ceramic proppant sales volume  but fracture and reservoir diagnostic services are becoming an increasingly important part of revenue growth 
because ceramic proppant are used on less than percent of fractures worldwide  the company believes there is significant potential for growth in the future 
as a result  in recent years  the company has been adding significant new manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated future demand 
the company began producing product from a new manufacturing facility in toomsboro  georgia in january and during the year that plant demonstrated the ability to operate at design capacity of million pounds per year 
construction of a second production line at the toomsboro facility is underway and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of the second line will add an additional million pounds of annual capacity 
the manufacturing facility in russia that is expected to be completed during the first quarter of is designed to have initial production capacity of million pounds per year 
by the end of  the company expects to have expanded its proppant manufacturing capacity by approximately over a two year period 
because the company s ceramic proppants compete in part against lower cost alternatives  the company expects its future revenue growth to be derived from increasing sales volume more so than from an increase in the selling price of ceramic proppant 
operating profit margin for the company s proppant business is principally impacted by manufacturing costs and the company s production levels as a percentage of its capacity 
while most direct production expenses have been relatively stable or predictable over time  natural gas  which is used in production by the company s domestic manufacturing facilities  has varied from approximately to of total monthly direct production expense over the last three years due to price volatility of this fuel source 
during  market prices of natural gas increased sharply  peaking during the fourth quarter of that year 
while the company had contracted in advance for most of its domestic natural gas requirements through october  beginning in november  the company began paying current market rates for all of its domestic requirements 
as a result  the average price of natural gas delivered to the company s us manufacturing facilities increased during the fourth quarter of compared to the average price during the first three quarters of that year 
in an effort to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas purchases and reduce exposure to short term spikes in the price of this commodity  in late the company resumed contracting in advance for portions of its future natural gas requirements and continued this practice throughout despite the efforts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices  it is possible that  given the significant portion of manufacturing costs represented by this fuel  operating margins may decline and changes in net income may not fully reflect changes in revenue 
management believes the addition of new manufacturing capacity is critical to the company s ability to continue its long term growth in sales volume and revenue for ceramic proppant 
with the addition of the toomsboro manufacturing facility in  the company has almost tripled its production capacity since while the company has operated near or at full capacity for much of the previous ten years  addition of significant new capacity in the future could adversely impact operating profit margins if the timing of this new capacity does not match increases in demand for the company s products 
as the company s sales volume has increased  and as the company has expanded in international markets  there has been an increase in activities and expenses related to marketing  distribution  research and development  and finance and administration 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased in recent years 
in the future  the company expects to continue to actively pursue new business opportunities by increasing marketing activities globally  improving and expanding its distribution capabilities  and focusing on new product development the company expects that these activities will generate increased revenue  however selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may increase in from levels as the company continues to expand outside of north america 

table of contents general business conditions the company s proppant business is significantly impacted by the number of natural gas wells drilled in north america  where the majority of wells are hydraulically fractured 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are less dependent on natural gas markets but are influenced by the overall level of drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppant or fracture and reservoir diagnostic services is based on comparing the higher initial costs to the future value derived from increased production and recovery rates  the company s business is influenced by the current and expected prices of natural gas and oil 
worldwide oil and natural gas prices and related drilling activity levels remained very strong from through as a result  the company experienced record demand for its products and services worldwide 
however  the company s ability to sell additional ceramic proppant was limited by its production capacity in and in  the company benefited from the additional production capacity from its toomsboro  georgia manufacturing and established new records for sales volume  revenue and net income 
from through  the number of rigs actively drilling for oil and gas in the united states increased percent 
overseas drilling activity remained strong in and  and the company saw an increase in sales volume in many regions outside of north america 
however  sales declined in the russian market in both years compared to due to an increase in the availability of locally produced ceramic proppant and an increase in tariffs and freight surcharges on imported products 
the company is addressing this situation through construction of a manufacturing facility in russia which is expected to be complete in the first quarter of international revenues represented  and of total revenues from both operating segments in  and  respectively 
the company s fracture and reservoir diagnostics business is also impacted by the level of global drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
in this business benefited from both an increase in the level of global activity and increased acceptance and utilization of the fracture mapping services in the barnett shale formation in north central texas and in other unconventional natural gas formations 
the company believes that the demand for the services provided by its fracture and reservoir diagnostic business will increase as oil and gas production companies develop increasingly complex  unconventional reservoirs in north america and globally 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer generally upon delivery of products or at the time services are performed 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
in addition  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to three major customers  all of which are in the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
as of december   approximately of the balance in trade accounts receivable was attributable to those three customers 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of sales and periodically evaluates the allowance based on a review of trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are periodically reviewed for collectibility based on customers past credit history and current financial condition  and the allowance is adjusted  if necessary 
if a prolonged economic downturn in the petroleum pressure pumping industry were to occur or  for some other reason  any of the company s primary customers were to experience significant adverse conditions  the company s estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount and the allowance for doubtful accounts could be increased by material amounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
obsolete or unmarketable inventory historically has been insignificant and generally written off when identified 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgments about future demand and market conditions  and management believes that current inventories are properly valued at cost 
accordingly  no reserve to write down inventories has been recorded 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents income taxes are provided for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in the company s financial condition  could affect these estimates 
long lived assets  which include net property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangibles  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying values of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
results of operations net income percent percent change change in thousands net income for the year ended december   the company reported record net income of million  greater than the million for the year ended december  and the fourth consecutive year in which the company established a new record for net income 
net income increased mainly due to record revenues from both operating segments 
also represented the fourth consecutive year the company achieved a new revenue record 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin versus the previous year primarily due to higher manufacturing costs in the proppant segment 
net income in also benefited somewhat from lower start up costs than experienced last year  as the bulk of start up activities for the company s toomsboro manufacturing facility occurred in late for the year ended december   net income of million represented a increase compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net income was driven primarily by the higher level of revenues generated in the increase in revenues was due to increases in both sales volume and the average selling price of ceramic proppant and an increase in revenues from fracture and reservoir diagnostics 
the revenue gain was partially offset by the impact of higher costs for natural gas and freight and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company s ability to increase sales volume of proppant in was limited by manufacturing capacity and inventory levels

worldwide proppant sales volume increased for the fourth consecutive year to million pounds and exceeded the sales record of million pounds by 
the volume of ceramic proppant sold in north america increased compared to as sales grew at a higher rate than north american drilling activity 
the north american increase was partially offset by a decline in overseas sales volume due to decreased sales in russia

international sales  which include overseas markets and the north american markets of canada and mexico  accounted for of sales volume in compared to in the average selling price of proppant in was per pound compared to per pound in the higher average selling price was due to increases in list prices that went into effect in june and november and  therefore  impacted only part of the year in but impacted the full year in fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment revenues of million for increased compared to million for the increase in revenues from the prior year was primarily due to a increase in mapping services related to gas well completions in north america 
fracture and reservoir diagnostics revenue benefited from an increase in global drilling and fracturing activity in  increased acceptance and utilization of the company s fracture mapping services in unconventional natural gas formations as well as increased revenue from the developing long term reservoir monitoring market 
proppant segment revenues of million for exceeded revenues of million by due to increases in both sales volume and the average selling price of proppant 
worldwide proppant sales volume totaled million pounds for compared to million pounds for demand for proppant was strong throughout the year  but sales volume was consistently limited by the company s production capacity and inventory levels 
increased natural gas drilling activity in north america spurred demand for proppant that led to a increase in north american sales volume compared to sales increases in north america were partially offset by a decline in overseas sales volume compared to the record level of overseas sales set in the primary reason for the overseas sales decline was a slowdown in russian sales due to an increase in the availability of locally produced proppant in that region  the pricing of which excludes the customs duties  tariffs and transportation expenses associated with imported products 
the company is addressing this situation through the construction of a manufacturing facility in kopeysk  russia 
excluding sales to russia  overseas sales volume increased compared to  still  russian sales led all overseas markets in international sales  which include overseas markets and the north american markets of canada and mexico  accounted for of sales volume in compared to in the average selling price of proppant was per pound in compared to in the higher average selling price was due to increases in list prices that went into effect in june and november fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment revenues of million for increased compared to million for the increase in revenues from the prior year was primarily due to a increase in mapping services related to gas well completions in north america

proppant segment gross profit for was million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  for while gross profit in exceeded by due to higher sales volume  it decreased as a percentage of revenues due to increases in the costs of manufacturing and distributing finished goods 
the primary factors contributing to higher manufacturing costs were increases in the cost of natural gas consumed by the company s us plants and the cost of raw materials used to manufacture high strength ceramic proppant 
compared to  the company experienced a increase in the average price paid in for natural gas delivered to its us manufacturing facilities 
the cost of natural gas increased in the fourth quarter of when forward purchase contracts covering the company s gas requirements for its us plants expired  subjecting the company to market prices that had increased significantly during the year 
fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment gross profit of million for increased by compared to gross profit of million for primarily due to the increase in revenue for this segment 
gross profit margin for this segment increased from in to in due to higher asset and people utilization driven by strong revenue growth across all north american regions 
proppant segment gross profit of million for increased by compared to gross profit of million for primarily due to increased sales volume 
gross profit margin declined from in to in the decline in gross profit margin resulted mainly from higher energy costs  including the cost of natural gas consumed in manufacturing proppant and fuel surcharges for raw material and finished product delivery 
in the fourth quarter of  forward contracts covering the purchase of natural gas requirements for the company s us manufacturing facilities expired and the company began paying current market rates for all of its domestic gas 
this resulted in a increase in the delivered price paid by the company for its gas requirements in the fourth quarter of compared to the previous three quarters 
the delivered cost of natural gas used in the company s domestic manufacturing facilities for the full year increased compared to the full year for most of  the company experienced an increase in the cost of shipping its product due to rising fuel prices and an increase in the volume of expedited shipments to meet us customer demand 
the company s conventional distribution method in north america is to rail ship product from its manufacturing facilities to stocking locations and then truck ship to customers 
following a draw down of inventory levels during then record sales volume quarters in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  strong demand for the remainder of regularly required the company to bypass its conventional distribution method and expedite shipments by more expensive truck hauls directly from manufacturing facilities to customers

uses of cash included million of capital spending and million of cash dividends 
major capital spending included million on a new proppant manufacturing facility in kopeysk  russia  which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of at an estimated cost of million  million on a new proppant manufacturing facility in toomsboro  georgia  which was completed slightly below planned expenditure of million and began operating in the first quarter of  on a second production line at the toomsboro facility  which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of and add million pounds of annual capacity at an estimated cost of million  million on microseismic equipment for use in providing fracture mapping and reservoir diagnostic services and million to construct an office building in houston  texas to serve as a combined operations facility for pinnacle technologies and sales headquarters for the company s proppant business 
the company believes its results will be influenced by the level of natural gas drilling in north america but expects its ability to demonstrate the value of ceramic proppant relative to alternatives will allow it to grow sales volume and revenue at a more rapid pace than the growth rate associated with drilling or fracturing activity 
given the levels of natural gas inventories in north america  there is the possibility of a short term contraction in drilling activity 
the company believes any slow down in activity is more likely to occur in the first half of the year and expects self correcting mechanisms of the marketplace to adjust supply quickly  resulting in a relatively short period of depressed activity 
the company believes its twelve production lines at five production facilities worldwide give it a great deal flexibility to adjust supply to meet demand for its ceramic proppant 
subject to its financial condition  the amount of funds generated from operations and the level of capital expenditures  the company s current intention is to continue to pay quarterly dividends to holders of its common stock 
on january   the company s board of directors approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of per share to shareholders of the company s common stock on january  the company estimates its total capital expenditures in will be between million and million  including completion of its manufacturing facility in kopeysk  russia and expansion of its facility in toomsboro  georgia  expansion of its distribution facilities and acquisition or construction of additional fracture mapping tools 
the company maintains an unsecured line of credit of million 
as of december   there was no outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
the company anticipates that cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet planned operating expenses  tax obligations and capital expenditures for the next months 
the company also believes that it could acquire additional debt financing  if needed 
based on these assumptions  the company believes that its fixed costs could be met even with a moderate decrease in demand for the company s products
