item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations seasonality and quarterly results of operations and item a 
risk factors our business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season 
and if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our product to our customers in sufficient quantities  or if our inventory levels are too high  our operating results will be adversely affected 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
we also retain independent contractors to provide various services  primarily in connection with our content development 
we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
in the third quarter of  we reorganized our company to create four product groups reading solutions  interactive educational games  fly and grade school and infant toddler preschool 
there was little impact on headcount as a result of this organization 
in the fourth quarter we restructured our schoolhouse segment to focus our sales and product development resources on reading curriculum for core grade levels and to better align it with our consumer strategy 
with these changes we expect the segment to have a positive earnings contribution in this restructuring led to termination of full time employees in the schoolhouse segment

item a 
risk factors our business and the results of its operations are subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
the following is a description of some of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future financial performance 
our operating plan may not correct recent trends in our business 
in july  our board of directors appointed jeffrey g 
katz as our president and chief executive officer 
under mr 
katz s leadership  we commenced and completed a full strategic review of our business 
the critical strategic themes of the plan that resulted from this review are detailed in item business overview 
we may encounter difficulties executing our new business strategy 
among other things  we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments to develop and implement the technological advances required to maintain our competitive position in our industry 
therefore  we cannot provide any assurance that we can successfully implement this strategic plan  or if implemented  that it will appreciably improve sales and earnings 
failure to execute our operating plan may have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to predict consumer preferences and trends accurately  develop and introduce new products rapidly or enhance and extend our existing core products  our sales will suffer 
sales of our platforms  related software and stand alone products typically have grown in the periods following initial introduction  but we expect sales of specific products to decrease as they mature 
for example  net sales of the classic leappad and my first leappad platforms in our us consumer business peaked in and have been declining since 
therefore  the introduction of new products and the enhancement and extension of existing products  through the introduction of additional software or by other means  is critical to our future sales growth 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop new technologies and products and enhance existing technologies and product lines  as well as successfully integrate third party technology with our own 

table of contents the successful development of new products and the enhancement and extension of our current products will require us to anticipate the needs and preferences of consumers and educators and to forecast market and technological trends accurately 
consumer preferences  and particularly children s preferences  are continuously changing and are difficult to predict 
in addition  educational curricula change as states adopt new standards 
we cannot assure you that these products will be successful or that other products will be introduced or  if introduced  will be successful 
the failure to enhance and extend our existing products or to develop and introduce new products that achieve and sustain market acceptance and produce acceptable margins would harm our business and operating results 
we depend on key personnel  and we may not be able to hire  retain and integrate sufficient qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business 
our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executives and technical  sales  marketing  manufacturing and administrative personnel 
in july  our board of directors appointed jeffrey g 
katz as our president and chief executive officer 
subsequent to mr 
katz s appointment  we reorganized our management team and appointed new global business leaders for our product lines 
during  we hired a new vice president of software engineering  vice president of web products  vice president of hardware engineering  and senior vice president of human resources  and in early  we hired a new executive vice president  international and a new executive vice president of product  innovation and marketing 
we also commenced a full strategic review and planning process  which will require us to add new strategic capabilities and related management personnel 
we have experienced significant turnover in our management positions 
if our new leaders are unable to properly integrate into the business or if we are unable to appropriately replace personnel or functional capabilities on a timely basis or at all  our business will be adversely affected 
in october  we completed consolidation of our office locations  moving our research and development offices from los gatos  california to our corporate headquarters in emeryville  california  approximately miles away 
we may face the challenge of retaining our los gatos personnel due to the change of location and may be unable to hire skilled personnel to replace them 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
if we fail to retain  hire  train and integrate qualified employees and contractors  we will not be able to maintain and expand our business 
part of our compensation package includes stock and or stock options 
if our stock performs poorly  it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees 
in addition  because we have been required to treat all stock based compensation as an expense as of january   we experienced increased compensation costs in changes in compensation packages or costs could impact our profitability and or our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel 
our advertising and promotional activities may not be successful 
our products are marketed through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs 
our ability to sell product is dependent in part upon the success of such programs 
if we do not successfully market our products  or if media or other advertising or promotional costs increase  these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  our sales and market share could decline 
we currently compete primarily in the infant toddler preschool category  and electronic learning aids category of the us toy industry and  to some degree  in the overall us and international toy industry 
we believe that we are also beginning to compete  and will increasingly compete in the future  with makers of popular game platforms and smart mobile devices such as personal digital assistants 
our schoolhouse segment competes in the us supplemental educational materials market 
each of these markets is very competitive and 
table of contents we expect competition to increase in the future 
many of our direct  indirect and potential competitors have significantly longer operating histories  greater brand recognition and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to changes in consumer requirements or preferences or to new or emerging technologies 
they may also devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively in our markets 
our business depends on three retailers that together accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales and of the us consumer segment sales in  and our dependence upon a small group of retailers may increase 
wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted in the aggregate for approximately of our net sales in in  sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
we expect that a small number of large retailers will continue to account for a significant majority of our sales and that our sales to these retailers may increase as a percentage of our total sales 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our retailers 
as a result  agreements with respect to pricing  shelf space  cooperative advertising or special promotions  among other things  are subject to periodic negotiation with each retailer 
retailers make no binding long term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering one time purchase orders 
if any of these retailers reduce their purchases from us  change the terms on which we conduct business with them or experience a future downturn in their business  our business and operating results could be harmed 
our business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season 
sales of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal  causing the substantial majority of our sales to retailers to occur during the third and fourth quarters 
in  approximately of our total net sales occurred during the latter half of the year 
this percentage of total sales may increase as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through just in time inventory management systems 
generally  retailers time their orders so that suppliers like us will fill the orders closer to the time of purchase by consumers  thereby reducing their need to maintain larger on hand inventories throughout the year to meet demand 
failure to predict accurately and respond appropriately to retailer and consumer demand on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations  or any disruption of consumer buying habits during this key period  would harm our business and operating results 
we expect that we will continue to incur losses in and in the first and second quarters of each year for the foreseeable future 
if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our product to our customers in sufficient quantities  or if our retailer s inventory levels are too high  our operating results will be adversely affected 
the high degree of seasonality of our business places stringent demands on our inventory forecasting and production planning processes 
if we fail to meet tight shipping schedules  we could damage our relationships with retailers  increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost 
in order to be able to deliver our merchandise on a timely basis  we need to maintain adequate inventory level of the desired products 
if our inventory forecasting and production planning processes result in us manufacturing inventory levels in excess of the levels demanded by our customers  our operating results could be adversely affected due to additional inventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
if the inventory of our products held by our retailers is too high  they will not place orders for additional products  which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents we depend on our suppliers for our components and raw materials  and our production or operating margins would be harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available 
some of the components used to make our products  including our application specific integrated circuits  or asics  currently come from a single supplier 
additionally  the demand for some components such as liquid crystal displays  integrated circuits or other electronic components is volatile  which may lead to shortages 
if our suppliers are unable to meet our demand for our components and raw materials and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price available from our current suppliers or an alternative source is prohibitive  our ability to maintain timely and cost effective production of our products would be seriously harmed and our operating results would suffer 
in addition  as we do not have long term agreements with our major suppliers  they may stop manufacturing our components at any time 
we rely on a limited number of manufacturers  virtually all of which are located in china  to produce our finished products  and our reputation and operating results could be harmed if they fail to produce quality products in a timely and cost effective manner and in sufficient quantities 
we outsource substantially all of our finished goods assembly  using several asian manufacturers  most of who manufacture our products at facilities in the guangdong province in the southeastern region of china 
we depend on these manufacturers to produce sufficient volumes of our finished products in a timely fashion  at satisfactory quality and cost levels and in accordance with our and our customers terms of engagement 
if our manufacturers fail to produce quality finished products on time  at expected cost targets and in sufficient quantities  our reputation and operating results would suffer 
in addition  as we do not have long term agreements with our manufacturers  they may stop manufacturing for us at any time  with little or no notice 
we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our finished products and our business and operating results could be harmed 
increases in our component or manufacturing costs could reduce our gross margins 
cost increases for our components or manufacturing services  whether resulting from shortages of materials  labor or otherwise  including  but not limited to rising cost of materials  transportation services  labor  commodity price increases and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations could negatively impact our gross margins 
because of market condition and other factors  we may not be able to offset any such increased costs by adjusting the price of our products 
any errors or defects contained in our products  or our failure to comply with applicable safety standards  could result in delayed shipments or rejection of our products  damage to our reputation and expose us to regulatory or other legal action 
we have experienced  and in the future may experience  delays in releasing some models and versions of our products due to defects or errors in our products 
our products may contain errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun  which could result in the rejection of our products by our retailers  damage to our reputation  lost sales  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims  any of which could harm our business 
individuals could sustain injuries from our products  and we may be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting from such injuries 
there is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed  or fall outside the scope of  our insurance coverage 
moreover  we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future 
we are subject to the federal hazardous substances act  the flammable fabrics act  regulation by the consumer product safety commission  or cpsc  and other similar federal  state and international rules and regulatory authorities 
our products could be subject to involuntary recalls and other actions by such authorities 
concerns about potential liability may lead us to recall voluntarily selected products 
recalls or post manufacture repairs of our products could harm our reputation  increase our costs or reduce our net sales 

table of contents we have had significant challenges to our management systems and resources  particularly in our supply chain and information systems  and as a result we may experience difficulties managing our business 
we rely on various information technology systems and business processes to manage our operations 
we are currently implementing modifications and upgrades to our systems and processes 
there are inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems and processes  including substantial capital expenditures  demands on management time and the risk of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems 
any information technology system disruptions  if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated  could have an adverse effect on our business and operations 
our international consumer business may not succeed and subjects us to risk associated with international operations 
we derived approximately of our net sales from markets outside the united states in as part of our business review  we announced in july  we are in the process of reviewing our international business and expect to strengthen our international product and distribution effectiveness 
however  our efforts to increase sales for our products outside the united states may not be successful and may not achieve higher sales or gross margins or contribution to profitability 
our business is  and will increasingly be  subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally  including developing successful products that appeal to the international markets  political and economic instability  military conflicts and civil unrest  greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  transportation delays and interruptions  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights  complications in complying with laws in varying jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations  and limitations  including taxes  on the repatriation of earnings 
any difficulties with our international operations could harm our future sales and operating results 
our financial performance will depend in part on our schoolhouse segment  which may not be successful 
we launched our schoolhouse segment in june to deliver classroom instructional programs to the pre kindergarten through th grade school market and explore adult learning opportunities 
to date  the schoolhouse segment  has incurred cumulative operating losses 
in december  we announced a reorganization of the schoolhouse segment  which reduced the size of our schoolhouse organization by half 
going forward  the segment is focusing sales and product development resources on reading curriculum for core grade levels 
however  if we cannot continue to increase market acceptance of our schoolhouse segment s supplemental educational products  the segment s future sales and profitability could suffer 
our intellectual property rights may not prevent our competitors from using our technologies or similar technologies to develop competing products  which could weaken our competitive position and harm our operating results 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technologies that are used in our learning platforms and related software 
we rely  and plan to continue to rely  on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  
table of contents service trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
the contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property or deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where we do not hold patents or trademarks or where the laws may not protect our intellectual property as fully as in the united states 
some of our products and product features have limited intellectual property protection  and  as a consequence  we may not have the legal right to prevent others from reverse engineering or otherwise copying and using these features in competitive products 
in addition  monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is costly  and any dispute or other litigation  regardless of outcome  may be costly and time consuming and may divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
however  if we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully  our rights could be diminished and our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
for additional discussion of litigation related to the protection of our intellectual property  see part i  financial information  note to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings 
leapfrog enterprises  inc v 
fisher price  inc 
and mattel  inc 
third parties have claimed  and may claim in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights  which may cause us to incur significant litigation or licensing expenses or to stop selling some of our products or using some of our trademarks 
in the course of our business  we periodically receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents  copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 
responding to any infringement claim  regardless of its validity  may be costly and time consuming  and may divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
if we  our distributors or our manufacturers are adjudged to be infringing the intellectual property rights of any third party  we or they may be required to obtain a license to use those rights  which may not be obtainable on reasonable terms  if at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of some of our products or against the use of a trademark or copyright in the sale of some of our products 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all the liability that could be imposed 
for more information regarding this see part i  financial information  note to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings tinkers chance v 
leapfrog enterprises  inc our net loss would be increased and our assets would be reduced if we are required to record impairment of our intangible assets 
intangible assets include the excess purchase price over the cost of net assets acquired  or goodwill 
goodwill arose from our september acquisition of substantially all the assets and business of our predecessor  leapfrog rbt  and our acquisition of substantially all the assets of explore technologies in july our intangible assets had a net balance of million and million at december  and  respectively  which are allocated to our us consumer segment 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
in determining the existence of impairment  we consider changes in our strategy and in market conditions and this could result in adjustments to our recorded asset balances 
specifically  we would be required to record impairment if the carrying values of our intangible assets exceed their estimated fair values 
such impairment recognition would decrease the carrying value of intangible assets and increase our net loss 
at december  and  we had million of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we tested our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment during the fourth quarter by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values 
as a result of this assessment  we determined that no adjustments were necessary to the stated values 

table of contents we are subject to international  federal  state and local laws and regulations that could impose additional costs or changes on the conduct of our business 
we operate in a highly regulated environment with international  federal  state and local governmental entities regulating many aspects of our business  including products and the importation of products 
regulations with which we must comply include accounting standards  taxation requirements including changes in applicable income tax rates  new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations  trade restrictions  regulations regarding financial matters  environmental regulations  advertising directed toward children  safety and other administrative and regulatory restrictions 
compliance with these and other laws and regulations could impose additional costs on the conduct of our business 
while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that have achieved compliance or that we will be in compliance in the future 
failure to comply with the relevant regulations could result in monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  changes in laws or regulations may lead to increased costs  changes in our effective tax rate  or the interruption of normal business operations that would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation  arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 
we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations  litigation and arbitration disputes 
as the outcome of these matters is difficult to predict  it is possible that the outcomes of any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the business 
for more information regarding litigation see part i  financial information  note to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings in this report 
weak economic conditions  armed hostilities  terrorism  natural disasters  labor strikes or public health issues could have a material adverse effect on our business 
weak economic conditions in the us or abroad as a result of lower consumer spending  lower consumer confidence  higher inflation  higher commodity prices  such as the price of oil  political conditions  natural disaster  labor strikes or other factors could negatively impact our sales or profitability 
furthermore  armed hostilities  terrorism  natural disasters  or public health issues  whether in the us or abroad could cause damage and disruption to our company  our suppliers or our customers or could create political or economic instability  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business 
although it is impossible to predict the consequences of any such events  they could result in a decrease in demand for our product or create delay or inefficiencies in our supply chain  by making it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products to our customers  or for our manufacturers to deliver products to us  or suppliers to provide component parts 
notably  our us distribution centers  including our distribution center in fontana  california  and our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past 
in addition to the factors noted above  our existing earthquake insurance relating to our distribution center may be insufficient and does not cover any of our other operations 
if we are unable to maintain the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and our management may not be able to provide its report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanes oxley act 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  and december  the assessment as of december   concluded that these controls were effective  and the assessment as of december  identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for our financial statement close process 
for more information  see 
table of contents item a 
controls and procedures in this report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 
we received an unqualified opinion from our external auditors on our financial statements for the years ended december  and areas of our internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time 
if management is unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at any time in the future  or if our external auditors are unable to express an opinion that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could result in the decrease of the market price of our class a common stock 
one stockholder controls a majority of our voting power as well as the composition of our board of directors 
holders of our class a common stock will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote 
our class a common stock entitles its holders to one vote per share  and our class b common stock entitles its holders to ten votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
as of december   lawrence j 
ellison and entities controlled by him beneficially owned approximately million shares of our class b common stock  which represents approximately of the combined voting power of our class a common stock and class b common stock 
as a result  mr 
ellison controls all stockholder voting power  including with respect to the composition of our board of directors and  through it  any determination with respect to our business direction and policies  including the appointment and removal of officers  any determinations with respect to mergers  other business combinations  or changes in control  our acquisition or disposition of assets  our financing activities  and payment of dividends on our capital stock  subject to the limitations imposed by our credit facility 
this control by mr 
ellison could depress the market price of our class a common stock or delay or prevent a change in control of leapfrog 
the limited voting rights of our class a common stock could negatively affect its attractiveness to investors and its liquidity and  as a result  its market value 
the holders of our class a and class b common stock generally have identical rights  except that holders of our class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders 
the holders of our class b common stock have various additional voting rights  including the right to approve the issuance of any additional shares of class b common stock and any amendment of our certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the rights of our class b common stock 
the difference in the voting rights of our class a common stock and class b common stock could diminish the value of our class a common stock to the extent that investors or any potential future purchasers of our class a common stock attribute value to the superior voting or other rights of our class b common stock 
provisions in our charter documents  delaware law and our credit facility agreement may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of our class a common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent and the voting power associated with our class b common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used by our board of directors to affect a rights plan or poison pill that could dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer and may have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing an 
table of contents acquisition of our company 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding voting stock 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
in addition  under the terms of our credit agreement  we may need to seek the written consent of our lenders of the acquisition of our company 
our stockholders may experience significant additional dilution upon the exercise of options or issuance of stock awards 
as of december   there were outstanding awards under our equity incentive plans that could result in the issuance of approximately million shares of class a common stock 
to the extent we issue shares upon the exercise of any of options  performance based stock awards or other equity incentive awards issued under our equity incentive plan  investors in our class a common stock will experience additional dilution 
our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value 
all the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price 
the timing of announcements in the public markets regarding new products  product enhancements by us or our competitors or any other material announcements could affect our stock price 
speculation in the media and analyst community  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock and market trends unrelated to our stock can cause the price of our stock to change 
a significant drop in the price of our stock could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business

in  this segment represented approximately of our total net sales 
although we are expanding our retail presence by selling our products online as well as to electronics and office supply stores  the vast majority of our us consumer sales are to a few large retailers 
net sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately of our us consumer segment sales in compared to in and in as a percentage of our consolidated net sales  combined net sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net sales in  and  respectively

business update in july  our board of directors appointed jeffrey g 
katz  as our president and chief executive officer 
under mr 
katz s leadership  we commenced and completed a full strategic review of our business 
this review was substantially completed in the fall of and when we announced the company plan to regain market leadership in the learn to read market 
build our business around key technology platform architectures 
provide web connectivity for all our products including those for ages and above 
strengthen our portfolio of products 
manage the business by creating a metrics driven culture 
we have begun to implement significant changes based on the findings of our full strategic review 
in particular  we are focusing our resources and investments in a few key areas reading solutions we will introduce a set of successor products to our leappad line of business  interactive educational games our successful leapster line will be updated  hardware margins improved  and our marketing will place a greater emphasis on software sales  across the board margin improvement we are making sourcing improvements  changing the design of key products to reduce product cost  deleting slow moving or weak margin stock keeping units skus  and reducing other operating costs that are not tied to product or earnings improvement  web connectivity key products will be web connected to support an improved play experience and better software sales  
table of contents aging up the fly fusion platform  our next generation fly product will launch in  and will expand leapfrog s age segment profile with an improved software library  web connectivity  and sleeker form factor  and enhanced and ease of use  international expansion  including china  where test marketing has begun 
in the third quarter of  we reorganized our company to create four product groups reading solutions  interactive educational games  fly and grade school  and infant toddler preschool 
the head of each product group is accountable for the profit and loss of their group and directs all product development and marketing for their portfolio of products 
we believe this new structure provides greater accountability for our key products and better aligns our resources to collaborate efficiently on our top priorities thereby enabling a faster return to profitability 
there was little impact on headcount as a result of this re organization 
in december  we restructured our schoolhouse segment to focus the sales and product development resources of this segment on reading curriculum for core grade levels  and to better align it with our consumer strategy 
this restructuring led to the termination of full time employees 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a related expense in selling  general and administration expense of approximately million 
summary of current results our consolidated net sales in were million  a decrease of million or compared to  on a reported and on a constant currency basis  which assumes that foreign currency exchange rates were the same in as sales in all segments declined during primarily as a result of significant reduction in the sales of our leappad family of products 
we increased our promotional activities to reduce existing fly pentop inventories as we plan to replace our fly pentop computer with the fly fusion pentop computer in sales of our screen based products were down slightly as retailers worked off excess inventories 
retailers inventories fell an estimated at the end of compared to the same period last year  which also negatively impacted our sales 
our gross margin decreased by percentage points to in compared to in gross margins declined in all segments of the business as a result of significant charges for allowance for excess and obsolete inventory  particularly in our us consumer and international segments 
in addition  we recorded higher sales discounts and allowances mainly due to promotional efforts to assist retailers reduce their slow moving inventories 
our selling  general and administrative expense increased by million  or  in compared to selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related employee benefits  legal fees  marketing expenses  systems costs  rent  office equipment  supplies and professional fees 
the increase was primarily due to higher stock based compensation expense associated with the adoption of statement of financial standard no 
r  share based payments  or sfas r  effective january   and severance expenses for terminated employees 
these expenses are partially offset by lower legal fees resulting from settlement of outstanding litigation and less expense associated with patent enforcement in our research and development expense increased by million  or  in compared to research and development expense consists primarily of costs related to content development  product development and product engineering 
the increase was primarily due to expenses associated with the consolidation of our engineering facilities into our headquarters at emeryville  california and additional expense for stock based compensation upon the adoption of sfas r 
our advertising expense increased by million  or  in compared to advertising expense consists primarily of television advertising  cooperative advertising  online promotions and in store displays 
advertising expense as a percentage of sales was in compared to in the increase was primarily attributable to our efforts to reduce inventory levels 

table of contents our loss from operations of million  compared to income of million in  was primarily driven by the decline in our sales  lower gross margin and higher operating expenses in our us consumer and international segments 
our provision for income taxes for was approximately million  compared to million for the increase in income tax expense was driven by the recognition of a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance against our gross domestic deferred tax assets in accordance with the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
our net loss was million for  respectively  compared to net income of million for the change was primarily due to the decline in our sales  lower gross margin and higher income tax expense 
our cash and cash equivalents combined with short term investments increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the reduction in our inventories and accounts receivable  partially offset by reduced earnings 
inventories  net of allowances  were million at december  and million at december  inventories decreased by million  or  from december  to december  in an effort to reduce inventory levels  we significantly curtailed inventory purchases  which resulted in lower inventory levels at december  inventory levels also reflect an increase of million in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
this increase was primarily due to our expectations related to future sales of existing products as well as products to be discontinued or replaced as a result of our updated strategic direction 
we have implemented strategies intended to improve our capability to forecast and control our inventory 
we have made and continue to make substantive changes that we believe will correct recent trends in our business 
specifically  during  we have taken the following actions we have consolidated some of our business groups and support functions based on the newly created core brands of our products 
these changes are consistent with our ongoing strategic plan and goals and we expect clearer accountability and authority over resources to lead to improved performance 
we completed the consolidation of our engineering facilities with our corporate headquarters in emeryville  california during the fourth quarter of we expect the improved integration of engineering with product and marketing to lead to product and cost improvements 
during and early  we hired new employees that have relevant experience and expertise for our senior management team and skills consistent with our new plan 
these include a new vp of software engineering  vp of web products  evp of international  vp of hardware engineering  evp of product  innovation and marketing  and svp of human resources 
we have also promoted a number of our most successful employees to senior roles 
in july  we completed the installation of the second phase of our oracle i erp system 
this system will improve the linkage between sales forecasting and inventory planning  and improve customer service levels for our retail customers  as well as the quality and timeliness of information to facilitate decision making 
the benefits of the erp installation will not be fully realized until after the season 
this system is also facilitating inventory reduction by our retailers 
we completed our sku redesign and rationalization  with total sku reduction of expected for we selected strategic suppliers and manufacturers to help us deliver our product strategy and improve costs 
we established a china engineering office to allow us to improve product costs and cycle times 

table of contents our outlook for and is consistent with our new strategic plan introduced in fall we plan to strengthen our position in the reading market by developing new reading solutions products  historically  our most successful product line  which we will begin introducing in we will leverage the success of our leapster product by introducing significant updates to the product and to the leapster family and expanding our software library 
we will age up our portfolio ie  increase the percentage of our products aimed at children age and above by launching products which are aimed at children who are older than our historically successful grade school age segment  such as our new fly fusion  fusion software and fusion accessories 
we anticipate that fly fusion will be utilized as well by our schoolhouse division and by third party partners around the world 
we will utilize the web to improve our users product experience  and to drive sales  marketing and brand awareness in the third quarter of  we will launch a number of new products  including our new fly fusion pentop computer  our first web connected platform  our new clickstart my first computer system and a number of products in our infant toddler preschool category 
while we expect these and other changes to improve trends in our performance  we do not expect them to contribute substantially until after  due to the lead time associated with our product development  sourcing and distribution aspects our business and also due to the year end seasonality that drives substantially all of our sales volume 
accordingly  we expect a modest sales decline in  improved gross margins from due to inventory reduction efforts and improved product mix and a decline in operating expenses from  consistent with the decline in sales 
overall  we expect a loss in  which we expect to be significantly less than the loss for for information on our operating plan that could affect our business  see item a 
risk factors our operating plan may not correct recent trends in our business 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and reported disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for accounts receivable  inventory valuation  the valuation of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities  intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on complex and subjective judgments often resulting from determining estimates about the impact of events and conditions that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant in affecting judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and title passes to the customer provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
net sales represent 
table of contents gross sales less negotiated price allowances based primarily on volume purchasing levels  estimated returns  allowances for defective products  markdowns and other sales allowances for customer promotions 
a small portion of our revenue related to training and subscriptions is deferred and recognized as revenue over a period of one to months 
we deferred less than of net sales in  and allowances for accounts receivable we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts we believe will become uncollectible 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our management s evaluation of the customer s financial condition  past collection history and aging of the accounts receivable balances 
if the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates  resulting in impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide estimated allowances for product returns  chargebacks  promotions and defectives on product sales in the same period that we record the related revenue 
we estimate our allowances by utilizing historical information for existing products 
for new products  we estimate our allowances for product returns on specific terms for product returns and our experience with similar products 
we continually assess our historical experience and adjust our allowances as appropriate  and consider other known factors 
if actual product returns  chargebacks  promotions and defective products are greater than our estimates  additional allowances may be required 
historically  our estimated allowances for accounts receivable  returns  chargebacks  promotions and defectives have been adequate to cover actual charges 
we disclose our allowances for doubtful accounts on the face of the balance sheet 
our other receivable allowances include allowances for product returns  chargebacks  defective products and promotional markdowns 
these other allowances totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in other receivable allowances was primarily due lower sales volume  improved shipping operations and faster collection of outstanding amounts 
these allowances are recorded as reductions of gross accounts receivable 
inventory valuation inventories  net are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
our estimate of an allowance for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories is based on our management s review of on hand inventories compared to their estimated future usage  demand for our products  anticipated product selling prices and products planned for discontinuation 
if actual future usage  demand for our products and anticipated product selling prices are less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
management monitors these estimates on a quarterly basis 
when considered necessary  management makes additional adjustments to reduce inventory to its net realizable value  with corresponding increases to cost of goods sold 
allowances for excess and obsolete inventory were million and million in and  respectively  and are recorded as a reduction of gross inventories 
the increase in allowances for excess and obsolescence reflects higher reserves for the leappad family of products  given their continuing sales declines and planned replacement in  as well as higher reserves for the fly pentop computer 
the fly fusion computer  the next generation of fly  will be introduced in fall intangible assets intangible assets include the excess purchase price over the cost of net assets acquired  or goodwill 
goodwill arose from our september  acquisition of substantially all the assets and business of our predecessor  leapfrog rbt  and our acquisition of substantially all the assets of explore technologies on july  our intangible assets had a net balance of million and million at december  and  respectively and are allocated to our us consumer segment pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
at december  and  we had million of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we tested our goodwill and other 
table of contents intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment during the fourth quarter by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values 
as a result of this assessment  we determined that no adjustments were necessary to the stated values 
intangible assets with other than indefinite lives include patents  trademarks and licenses  one of which is a ten year technology license agreement entered into in january to jointly develop and customize our optical scanning technology 
the determination of related useful lives and whether the intangible assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require that adjustments be recorded to asset balances 
we review intangible assets  as well as other long lived assets  for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
stock based compensation at december   we had stock based compensation plans for employees and nonemployee directors which authorized the granting of various stock based incentives including restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock options 
the vesting periods for restricted stock and restricted stock units are generally three and four years  respectively 
we also grant stock options to certain of our employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price generally equal to the fair value of the shares on the date of grant 
these options generally vest over a four year period 
prior to january   we accounted for the stock based compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of apb opinion no  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  permitted under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
as a result  stock based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to the financial statements 
effective  january   we adopted the recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based compensation sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost in included the portion vesting in the period for all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested  as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for the prior periods have not been restated 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the total grant date fair value is recognized over the vesting period of the options on a straight line basis 
the weighted average assumptions for the expected life and the expected stock price volatility used in the model require the exercise of judgment 
the risk free interest rate used in the model is based on the assumed expected life 
the expected life of the options represent the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the guidance provided in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
on share based payment 
expected stock price volatility is based on a consideration of our stock s historical and implied volatilities as well as the volatilities of other public entities in our industry 
the risk free interest rate used in the model is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant and has a term equal to the expected life 
restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are payable in shares of our class a common stock 
the fair value of each restricted stock or unit is equal to the closing market price of our stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of grant 
the grant date fair value is recognized in income over the vesting period of these stock based awards 
the cost of our performance based stock awards is expensed based on achieving pre established financial measures  including certain stock price milestones 
we did not achieve the related financial goals in   and  resulting in cancellation of the associated share grants 
stock based compensation arrangements to non employees are accounted for using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to re measurement over the vesting terms 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
during  we recorded a non cash valuation allowance of million against its gross deferred tax assets of million  of which million relates to pre deferred tax assets 
the amount represents of the domestic deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
our domestic net operating losses for the most recent four year period  the expectation of additional net operating losses in and changes in our business strategy increased the uncertainty about whether the level of future profitability needed to record the deferred assets will be achieved and represented sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
should we determine that we would be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination was made 
the majority of our domestic deferred tax assets generally have years until expiry or indefinite lives 
our financial statements also include accruals for the estimated amounts of probable future assessments that may result from the examination of federal  state or international tax returns 
our tax accruals  tax provision  deferred tax assets or income tax liabilities may be adjusted if there are changes in circumstances  such as changes in tax law  tax audits or other factors  which may cause management to revise its estimates 
the amounts ultimately paid on any future assessments may differ from the amounts accrued and may result in an increase or reduction to the effective tax rate in the year of resolution

discounts and allowances mainly due to our promotional efforts to reduce retailers slow moving inventories  increased by million in specifically  we reported lower sales for our fly pentop computer business compared to  reflecting promotional and other activities to reduce existing fly pentop inventories in its last selling season 
we plan to replace the fly pentop computer with the fly fusion pentop computer in these factors were partially offset by direct sales at our on line store of approximately million compared to million in we plan to continue building our web products business 
we expect to continue to improve our online sales principally by improving our sales efforts and methodologies at the web stores of our major retail customers and at the all online e tailers  and also at our own online web store 

table of contents international 
our international segment s net sales decreased by million  or  from million in to million in on a constant currency basis  net sales decreased from to the net sales decrease in our international segment was primarily due to a significant reduction in our united kingdom market  which represents approximately of our international net sales 
factors driving this decline were sales decline from million in to million in in the united kingdom  which were driven primarily by the significant decline in sales of our leappad family of products 
approximately million of the sales decline was due to discounts and other allowances to provide consumers with the incentive to purchase these products and reduce retailers inventories 
in other countries  we also incurred an additional million sales allowances to reduce our inventories and those of our retailer customers 
these factors were partially offset by higher sales in canada  spain  mexico and smaller markets in asia and europe in compared to unlike the mature uk market  which is seeing declining leappad sales  many of these markets are relatively new and have strong leappad sales 
some of these countries sales were also aided by the introduction of spanish and french versions of leapster in schoolhouse

as a percentage of net sales  net income increased from a loss of in to a gain of in seasonality and quarterly results of operations leapfrog s business is highly seasonal  with our retail customers making a large percentage of all purchases in preparation for the traditional holiday season 
our business  being subject to these significant seasonal fluctuations  generally realizes the majority of our net sales and all of our net income during the third and fourth calendar quarters 
these seasonal purchasing patterns and production lead times cause risk to our business associated with the under production of popular items and over production of items that do not match consumer demand 
in addition we have seen our customers managing their inventories more stringently  requiring us to ship products closer to the time they expect to sell to consumers  increasing our risk to meet the demand for specific products at peak demand times  or adversely impacting our own inventory levels by the need to pre build products to meet the demand 
for more information  see item a risk factors our business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season and if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our product to our customers in sufficient quantities  or if our or our retailers inventory levels are too high  our operating results will be adversely affected 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly statements of operations information for and the unaudited quarterly information includes all normal recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 
given the low sales volumes in the first half of the calendar year  and the relatively fixed nature of our operating expenses  historically we have been profitable in our third and fourth quarters and unprofitable in our first and second quarters 
we expect that we will continue to incur losses during the first and second quarters of each year for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we were unprofitable in the fourth quarter of  due to higher sales allowances  higher operating expenses and higher expense for excess and obsolete inventory 
we were also unprofitable in the third and fourth quarter of  due to higher inventory reserves in both quarters and a non cash valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the third quarter 
relatively low sales in the third and fourth quarter of also prevented us from being able to absorb our relatively fixed operating expenses in these quarters 
because of the seasonality of our business and other factors  results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year

sfas requires that previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a remeasurement new basis event  on an instrument by instrument basis  in cases in which a derivative would otherwise have to be bifurcated 
change in fair value should be recognized in earnings 
sfas establishes a requirement to evaluate interest in securitized financial assets to determine if they are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation 
the guidance is effective for all periods beginning after september  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have material impact in our consolidated financial statements

eitf requires a company to disclose its accounting policy ie gross vs 
net basis relating to the presentation of taxes within the scope of eitf furthermore  for taxes reported on a gross basis  an enterprise should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented

in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin which became effective for the company on january  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for income tax benefits that are uncertain in nature 
under fin  a company will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management s assessment is that its position is more likely than not ie  a greater than percent likelihood to be upheld on audit based only on the technical merits of the tax position 
this accounting interpretation also provides guidance on measurement methodology  derecognition thresholds  financial statement classification and disclosures  interest and penalties recognition  and accounting for the cumulative effect adjustment 
the new interpretation is intended to provide better financial statement comparability among different companies 
the expected impact of adopting fin is estimated to be an increase in our risk reserves associated with income taxes by million 
of this amount  less than million will reduce beginning retained earnings for  and the remainder will decrease net operating loss  or nol carryforwards in the us  which are fully offset by a valuation allowance  and any subsequent impact may be recognized in provision for income taxes 
in addition to the financial statement impact of adopting fin  future disclosures will also include a tabular roll forward of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of the period  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate  the amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the financial statements  any expected significant impacts from unrecognized tax benefits on the financial statements over the subsequent twelve month reporting period and a description of the tax years remaining to be examined in major tax jurisdictions

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement rollover and balance sheet iron curtain approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
if prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial now are considered material based on either approach  no restatement is required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered 
if prior years are not restated  the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening accumulated earnings deficit as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption
