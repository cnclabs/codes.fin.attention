item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and notes included in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations  and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this annual report on form k 
retroactive adjustments have been made to all per share data for two stock splits a for stock split effected on december  which resulted in the par value decreasing from to per share  and a for stock split effected on june   which resulted in the par value decreasing from to for accounting purposes 
we have rounded the par value to per share for presentation purposes 
year ended december  the following discussion and analysis sets forth the major factors that affected first security s financial condition as of december  and  and results of operations for the three years ended december  as reflected in the audited financial statements 
overview as of december   we had total consolidated assets of approximately billion  total loans of approximately million  total deposits of approximately million  and stockholders equity of approximately million 
in  our net income was million  resulting in basic and diluted net income of and per share  respectively 
as of december   we had total consolidated assets of approximately billion  total loans of approximately million  total deposits of approximately million  and stockholders equity of approximately million 
in  our net income  after recognizing an extraordinary gain  net of tax  of million was million  resulting in basic and diluted net income of and per share  respectively 
the extraordinary gain was recognized as a result of a purchase accounting adjustment related to the acquisition of our leasing companies in october the gain resulted from the elimination of a tax liability when it became increasingly evident after ongoing discussions with the seller and the preparation of our respective tax returns for  that the obligation for the payment was too remote to be carried on our books as a specific obligation 
net interest income and non interest income for increased by million and million respectively  while non interest expense  including provision for loan losses  increased by million as compared to income increases outpaced expense increases as a result of the additional earning assets acquired through our acquisition and branching activity during and our efficiency ratio improved in to compared to in and in we expect to continue achieving further efficiencies by growing our operating revenue faster than our expenses  as well as evaluating staff levels with particular emphasis on our branches 
we completed our corporate headquarters in downtown chattanooga  tennessee in the fourth quarter of in  we anticipate opening de novo branches in cookeville  tennessee and cleveland  tennessee as well as a loan production office in marietta  georgia 
net interest margin in was or basis points lower as compared to the prior period of 
the net interest margin of our peer group as reported on the december  uniform bank performance report was unchanged at for and our margin declined as expected due to the inclusion of jackson bank and the increase in deposit yields due to highly competitive market conditions  the flat yield curve interest rate environment and the lag in cd repricing 
while our net interest margin remains among the highest 
table of contents of our peer group  we expect our margin to decline in the first half of due to continuing changes in the mix of deposits to high yielding products including retail and jumbo certificates of deposits 
furthermore  by the end of the second quarter  a majority of the cd portfolio will have renewed at current market rates from previously lower rates when we were in a different point of the interest rate cycle 
we anticipate the margin to stabilize in the second half of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
critical accounting policies include the initial adoption of an accounting policy that has a material impact on our financial presentation as well as accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements that require us to make estimates and assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time 
disclosure about critical estimates is required if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets each represent a critical accounting estimate 
the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained at levels management deems adequate to absorb possible credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the level is based on past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  underlying estimated values of collateral securing loans  current economic conditions and other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate of credit losses in the loan portfolio and the related allowance would also change 
refer to the provision for loan losses section for a discussion of our methodology of establishing the allowance for loan losses 
sfas no 
prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas no 
discontinue the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
instead  these assets are subject to at least an annual impairment review and more frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate impairment may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
results of operations we reported net income for of million versus net income for of million after the recognition of extraordinary gains in of million 
net income for was million after the recognition of extraordinary gain  net of tax  of thousand

in  basic net income per share was on approximately million shares and diluted net income per share was on approximately million weighted average shares outstanding 
in  basic net income per share was on approximately million shares and diluted net income per share was on approximately million weighted average shares outstanding 
net income in was above the level as a result of a full year inclusion of jackson bank which was acquired in august  our branching and deposit gathering activities  and improving our core efficiency by growing revenue faster than expenses 
our overhead also increased in because of our jackson bank acquisition and completion of the corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter 
as of december   we had banking offices  including the headquarters  three leasing offices and full time equivalent employees 
although  we expect to continue to expand our branch network and our employee force in  we are mindful of the fact that growth and increasing the number of branches adds expenses such as administrative costs and occupancy  salaries and benefits expenses before earnings

net interest income net interest income the difference between the interest earned on assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest paid on liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings is our primary source of operating income 
in  net interest income was million or more than the level of million  which in turn was more than the level of million 
we monitor and evaluate the effects of certain risks on our earnings and seek balance between the risks assumed and returns sought 
some of these risks include interest rate risk  credit risk and liquidity risk 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balances volume of interest earning assets and the various rate spreads between our interest earning assets and our funding sources 
changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  increases or decreases in the average interest rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities  the ability to manage the interest earning asset portfolio which includes loans  and the availability of particular sources of funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits 
interest income in was million  a increase over the level of million  which was a increase over the level of million 
year to year increases since are due to the annual increases in the volume of earning assets 
average earning assets in were million  an increase of 
table of contents million or from average earning assets 
the increase from to was million or 
the tax equivalent yield on earning assets increased basis points in to from in  which was basis points higher than the changes in the yield rates relate to our changing the mix of earning assets and the federal reserve board changing the federal funds rate and discount rate 
total interest expense was million in compared to million in and to million in the increase in interest expense in is primarily due to raising interest rates on deposits and the additional volume of interest bearing liabilities  which includes the impact of jackson bank for the full year 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to the additional volume of interest bearing liabilities 
the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to for from in and increased basis points from in to in the rate increase is a reflection of the market conditions in average interest bearing liabilities increased million or in compared to and million in or compared to the significant increase in interest bearing liabilities in was due to our market penetration and the full year of jackson bank 
the increase in was due to our market penetration  the acquisition of jackson bank and the issuance of brokered cds 
we primarily use brokered cds to match fund our leasing portfolio 
average total deposits grew million or to million in and increased million or to million in absent any competitive pricing pressures  we feel that our average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities will level off in the second half of the year as our time deposits mature and reprice at current market rates  which have stabilized since the federal reserves rate increase initiative ended in june of the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest income net interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate spread does not consider the impact of noninterest bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percentage of total average earning assets and takes into account the positive effects of investing noninterest bearing deposits in earning assets 
first security s net interest rate spread on a tax equivalent basis was in  in and in  while the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was in  in and in the decrease in the net interest spread and net interest margin for was primarily due to the jackson bank acquisition and the rates on interest bearing deposits increasing at a faster pace than the yields on earning assets due to the competition for deposits in our markets  the flat to inverted yield curve interest rate environment  and the lag in cd repricing 
the increased net interest margin from to was due to our earning assets repricing faster than our interest bearing liabilities in an increasing interest rate environment  changes in the mix of our earning assets and the acquisition of kenesaw leasing and j s leasing in october  which added approximately basis points to our net interest margin at that time 
in  we believe our net interest margin will continue to decrease before stabilizing in the second half of the year due to the continued competition for deposits 
average interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of average earning assets was in  in and in in  the federal reserve board raised the federal funds rate five times by a total of basis points  from to

charge offs in were million 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were in  in and in and our bank s peer group averages as reported in the december  uniform bank performance report were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in our provision for loan losses in relative to was a result of our analysis of inherent risks in the loan portfolio in relation to the portfolio s growth  the level of past due  charged off  classified and nonperforming loans  as well as general economic conditions 
as a result of our analysis  we determined during the fourth quarter of that we had adequately provided to absorb potential credit losses and as a result reduced our provision expense for the remainder of to reflect this improvement in credit quality 
management will reanalyze the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis  and the next review will be at march   or sooner if necessary  and the provision expense will be adjusted accordingly  if necessary 
we anticipate that during our provision expense for loan losses may increase due to projected loan growth 
our loan pipeline remains strong and we anticipate organic loan growth in will be consistent with the level of as a result of our branching and marketing activities 

table of contents the loan portfolio increased by million or from year end compared to an increase of million from year end to year end in we acquired approximately million in loans in our acquisition of jackson bank 
excluding maturities  prepayments  and payoffs of the purchased loans  our organic loan growth in was approximately million or 
our allowance for loan losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance for loan losses and the size of the allowance for loan losses compared to a group of peer banks 
during their routine examinations  regulators may require us to make additional provisions to our allowance for loan losses when  in the opinion of the regulators  their credit evaluations and allowance for loan loss methodology differ materially from ours 
during we made further improvements in our methodology and analysis of the loan loss reserve and are in process of implementing additional improvements which complies with recently communicated interagency regulatory guidance 
in addition to analyzing significant problem loans for possible deficiencies in sources of repayment  we also analyzed the loss history in specific pools of criticized and classified loans 
we then used this loss history to estimate the amount of loan loss coverage necessary for the smaller problem loans not specifically analyzed 
we also analyze our loan portfolio by product and compare our actual loss history with that reported by our peer banks 
our primary grouping of loans that are specifically analyzed for loss potential and specific reserves are as follows significant classified loans significant classified loans generally include those loans with a risk rating of substandard and a total exposure exceeding thousand  as well as all loans with a risk rating of doubtful 
for this loan group  management estimates the specific potential losses based upon an individual analysis of the relationship risks  the borrower s cash flow  the borrower s management and any underlying secondary sources of repayment 
if management believes or an outside third party s valuation indicates that the value of the secondary sources of repayment is less than the balance of the total corporate exposure  then a specific reserve is established or if appropriate  the deficiency is charged off against the allowance 
the definition of both substandard and doubtful risk ratings are outlined in item below 
other classified and criticized loans we reserve for loan pools that are criticized and classified  but are not considered significant  as described in item above  using flat percentages depending on the pool s risk rating and also the loss history of the specific pools of criticized and classified loans 
for this group  we analyze the geographic loan pools as follows i 
loans with risk ratings of special mention we reserve for special mention loans using a flat percentage of based upon the loss history experienced in this pool of loans for the previous months 
we refer to this analysis of these pools as vintage analysis 
for leases we are using a flat since this is a collateralized product 
the special mention risk rating is considered a criticized loan and is not considered as severe as a classified loan risk rating 
special mention loans are loans that must be followed closely because of identified potential weakness es  which if not checked and corrected  could result in an unacceptable increase in credit risk at some future date 
these loans may be characterized by loans to businesses downward trend in sales  profit levels and margins impaired working capital position compared to industry cash flow strained in order to meet debt repayment schedule technical defaults due to noncompliance with financial covenants 
table of contents recurring trade payable slowness high leverage compared to industry average with shrinking equity cushion questionable abilities of management weak industry conditions inadequate or outdated financial statements  if audited  adverse opinion may be issued loans to businesses or individuals loan delinquencies and overdrafts may occur original source of repayment questionable documentation deficiencies may not be easily correctable loan may need to be restructured collateral or guarantor offers adequate protection unsecured debt to tangible net worth is excessive ii 
loans with risk ratings of substandard we reserve for substandard loans that are generally less than thousand using based on the month vintage analysis testing results 
substandard leases are reserved at 
substandard loans are loans that reflect significant deficiencies with specifically identified and well defined weaknesses due to severely adverse trends of a financial  economic  or managerial nature 
for substandard loans  a protracted work out is likely due to the following factors  in addition to those listed for special mention loans loans to businesses sustained losses which have severely eroded equity and cash flows concentration in illiquid assets serious management problems or internal fraud chronic trade payable slowness  may be placed on cod or collection by trade creditor inability to access other funding sources financial statements with adverse opinion or disclaimer  may be received late insufficient documented cash flows to meet contractual debt service requirements loans to businesses or individuals chronic or severe delinquency or has met the retail classification standards which is generally past dues greater than days original repayment terms liberalized due to inability to meet original terms frequent overdrafts likelihood of bankruptcy exists serious documentation deficiencies reliance on secondary sources of repayment which are presently considered adequate demand letter sent litigation may have been filed against the borrower interest non accrual may be warranted 
table of contents iii 
loans with risk ratings of doubtful we analyze doubtful loans individually to determine our best estimate of loss based upon the most recent assessment of all available sources of repayment 
the amount of the estimated loss is then specifically reserved in a separate component of the allowance of loan loss reserve 
doubtful loans are loans where the collection or liquidation in full of principal and or interest is highly questionable or improbable 
doubtful loans must be placed on non accrual  and the principal balance charged down to estimated collectable value  or a full or partial reserve must be allocated 
in addition to the characteristics listed for substandard loans  the following characteristics apply to doubtful loans loans to businesses normal operations are severely diminished or have ceased seriously impaired cash flow numerous exceptions to loan agreement outside accountant questions entity s survivability as a going concern financial statements may be received late  if at all material judgments filed collection of principal and interest is impaired collateral guarantor may offer inadequate protection possibility of partial loss exists loans to businesses or individuals original repayment terms materially altered secondary source of repayment is inadequate asset liquidation may be in process with all efforts directed at debt retirement documentation deficiencies not correctable iv 
loans with risk ratings of loss we reserve loss loans at of the loan balance pursuant to our loan policy 
loss loans are loans of such limited value that they do not merit continuance as an acceptable asset  and therefore must be charged off in full in the fiscal quarter this grade is assigned 
as of december   december  and december   we did not have any loans risk rated as loss that had not been previously charged off 
unclassified and uncriticized loans in our analysis of these loan pools  we establish our reserves using our historical average net charge off base for loans for the prior six years 
as of december   our historical six year average net charge off rate for loans and three to five year historical charge off rate for leases was approximately and  respectively 
we also analyzed the loan portfolio excluding criticized and classified loans based upon six categories that may increase the risk of loss in the portfolio 
the six categories include i changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards and collection  charge off and recovery practices ii changes in national and local economic and business conditions iii changes in the trends  concentrations  nature and volume of the loan portfolio iv changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending staff 
table of contents v changes in credit quality indicators vi provision for lack of vintage analysis data we assigned reserve percentages for each of these categories ranging from to depending upon the perceived risk that each may have on the portfolio 
for example a low risk was assigned and a moderate risk was assigned 
these may increase or decrease each quarter depending upon the perceived risk in each category 
for purposes of analyzing the allowance for loan losses  the unclassified and uncriticized loan pools do not include binding commitments to lend  standby letters of credit  deposit secured loans or mortgage loans originated with commitments to sell in the secondary market 
loans secured by segregated deposits held by us are not required to have an allowance reserve  nor are originated mortgage loans pending sale in the secondary market 
while it is our policy to charge off in the current period loans for which a loss is considered probable  there are additional risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because these risks include the state of the economy  management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
for the year ended december   we provided additional provision for this category 
during  we will have adequate data and further provision for a lack of vintage analysis may not be necessary 
noninterest income total noninterest income for was million  compared to million in and million in we experienced solid organic growth of approximately year over year 
in and  jackson bank contributed approximately million and thousand  respectively  in non interest income 
the following table presents the components of noninterest income for years ended december   and noninterest income for the years ended percent change percent change dollar amounts in thousands nsf fees service charges on deposit accounts mortgage loan and related fees net loss gain on sales of available for sale securities other income total noninterest income our largest sources of noninterest income are service charges and fees on deposit accounts 
total service charges  including non sufficient funds nsf fees  were million  or of total noninterest income for compared with million  or of total noninterest income for  compared with million or for in addition to standard nsf fees  we offer a bounce protection program that pays our customers non sufficient fund checks to a predetermined limit for a fee 
this program and our growing deposit base caused our nsf fee income to increase from to organic growth of nsf fees was thousand or and thousand or for and  respectively 
effective january   we decreased the 
table of contents amount of time that we may hold an overdraft prior to charging it off from days to days to begin more aggressive recovery efforts earlier in the process 
as a result of this change  our nsf fees for remained relatively consistent as compared to  excluding the positive impact of thousand of nsf fees from jackson bank in service charges on deposit accounts decreased on an organic basis in as compared to and due to an increase in the average balance of checking and savings accounts thus decreasing the amount of service charges assessed to the customer  an increase in free checking due to competitive pressures and a reduction in commercial account analysis charges due to increases in the crediting rate which often occur in a rising interest rate environment 
at year end and we had  and  transaction and savings accounts  respectively 
we increased our transaction accounts by nearly  accounts while savings accounts decreased by approximately  this was due to the shift from savings accounts to higher yielding cds 
mortgage loan and related fees for were million  compared to million in and to the level of million 
our process to originate and sell a conforming mortgage in the secondary market typically takes to days from the date of mortgage origination to the date the mortgage is sold to an investor in the secondary market 
due to the normal processing time  we will have a certain amount of held for sale loans at any time 
mortgages originated for sale in the secondary market totaled million in mortgages sold in the secondary market totaled million in in  we originated and sold approximately million of residential mortgages  and in we originated and sold approximately million of residential mortgages 
we sold these loans with the right to service the loans the servicing asset being released to the purchaser for a fee 
other income for was million  compared to the level of million and the level of million 
the components of other income primarily consist of point of sale fees on debit cards  credit card fee income  atm fee income  earnings of bank owned life insurance  trust fee income  underwriting revenue  safe deposit box fee income and gains on sales of other real estate  repossessions  leased equipment and premises and equipment 
in  we recognized certain other non interest income  which we consider not to be in the normal course of business or recurring in nature 
adjusting for the non recurring items  other noninterest income increased million or in earnings on bank owned life insurance increased thousand or  reflecting a full year of earnings on the million of life insurance purchased in the first half of and the assumption of million through the jackson bank acquisition in august of trust fee income increased thousand or from point of service income increased thousand or  and gains on sales of foreclosed and repossessed property  leased equipment  and premises and equipment increased thousand  excluding the above mentioned non recurring thousand gain in 
table of contents noninterest expense total noninterest expense for was million  compared to million in and to million in noninterest expense for and included increases of approximately million and million  respectively in salaries and benefits as a result of growth within our core banking markets and the acquisitions of jackson bank in august and kenesaw leasing and j s leasing in october unless indicated otherwise in the discussion below  we anticipate increases in noninterest expense for as a result of our branching activities 
the following table represents the components of noninterest expense for the years ended december   and noninterest expense for the years ended percent change percent change dollar amounts in thousands salaries benefits occupancy furniture and equipment professional fees data processing printing supplies communications advertising intangible asset amortization other expense total noninterest expense total salaries and benefits increased in as compared to the increase in salaries and benefits is related to our staff additions to accommodate our growth  as well as the acquisition of jackson bank in the third quarter of the jackson bank acquisition resulted in approximately million of the overall increase in salaries and benefits in as of december   we had full service banking offices and three leasing offices with full time equivalent employees  as of december   we had full service banking offices and four leasing offices with full time equivalent employees  and as of december   we had full service banking offices  one loan production office and four leasing offices with full time equivalent employees 
in  we are budgeting to add a de novo branch in cookeville  tennessee as well as an additional branch in cleveland  tennessee 
we anticipate both branches opening in the second quarter 
the de novo branches along with the corporate headquarters that opened in december will increase non interest expense in total occupancy expense for increased by compared with  which was more than total occupancy expense in the increase in was primarily due to a full year of the five jackson bank branches which accounted for approximately thousand or of the overall thousand or increase 
the increase in was primarily due to a full year of expense related to opening three de novo branches in the second half of and two de novo branches in the fourth quarter of the increase in was due to our opening six de novo branches and assuming three facility leases through our acquisition of kenesaw leasing and j s leasing 
as of december   we leased facilities and the land for four branches 
as a result  occupancy expense is higher than if we owned these facilities  including the real estate  but conversely  we have been able to deploy the capital into earning assets rather than capital expenditures for facilities 

table of contents furniture and equipment expense and communication expense increased in due to a full year of jackson bank s five branches 
the increase in was due to de novo branch additions and the acquisition of jackson bank and the leasing companies 
the increase in was due to the acquisition of the leasing companies and our de novo branching additions 
professional fees increased by thousand or from to professional fees include fees related to investor relations  outsourcing internal audit  loan review  compliance and information technology audits to professional bank services  as well as external audit including testing under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  tax services and legal and accounting advice related to  among other things  potential acquisitions  investment securities  trademarks and intangible properties 
the increase in primarily relates to additional investor relations expense and sox section testing 
the increase in primarily relates to legal fees  investor relation fees associated with being a nasdaq listed company and external audit and tax services 
data processing expense increased thousand or in as compared to the monthly fees associated with data processing are primarily based on transaction volume 
the increase in is primarily related to certain credit administration software costs and the increase in transaction volume with the full year of jackson bank 
the credit administration software baker hill provides risk analysis for retail loan applications 
this program was implemented throughout all markets during we anticipate data processing expense to increase as we continue to grow 
intangible asset amortization increased by thousand or in as compared to and thousand or in compared to the increase in is due to the full year of expense associated with the non compete and core deposit intangible asset associated with the jackson bank acquisition 
the increase in is a result of the jackson bank acquisition in august amortizing intangible assets include core deposit intangible assets  a license fee agreement  and a non compete agreement 
the core deposit intangible assets amortize on an accelerated basis over an estimated useful life of years 
the license fee agreement relates to operating the primer banco seguro branches within our market 
the original life of years was reduced to years during when we recorded an impairment charge  which was recorded to other noninterest expense 
the non compete agreement is amortizing on a straight line basis of the useful life of years 
each year  goodwill is evaluated for possible impairment 
to date  no indications of impairment have been identified  thus no impairment expense has been recorded 
the following table represents our anticipated intangible asset amortization over the next five years  excluding new acquisitions  if any 
in thousands core deposit intangible amortization expense covenant not to compete license fee agreement amortization expense total amortization expense other expense decreased thousand or in as compared to and increased in as compared to other expense in includes thousand in costs that are not considered to be in the normal course of business or recurring in nature 
these costs were offset by increases in normal operating items as a function of our growth in the increase in is primarily a function of our increased branching activities combined with the acquisition of the leasing companies in october and jackson bank in august 
table of contents income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in  compared with million in and million in our effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
barring legislative tax changes  we anticipate our effective tax rate to remain stable in as of december   our net deferred tax liability was thousand and as of december   it was thousand 
statement of financial condition we ended with consolidated assets of billion  a increase over the year end level of billion  which was a increase over the year end level of million 
our loan and investment security growth is directly related to deposit growth and the funds available to us for investment 
in our consolidated asset growth remained consistent with the organic growth of  while our loan portfolio increased 
the growth is due to our branching and deposit gathering activities and utilizing our available alternative funding sources 
in our consolidated assets increased due to our branching and deposit gathering activities  our acquisition of jackson bank  which had approximately million in assets on the acquisition date and our initial public offering 
in our consolidated assets increased due to our branching and deposit gathering activities and our acquisition of kenesaw leasing and j s leasing  which we funded by issuing brokered cds 
in we opened two de novo bank branches and assumed five bank branches in our acquisition of jackson bank 
in we opened six de novo bank branches and assumed four leasing offices through our acquisition of kenesaw leasing and j s leasing 
in we expect our assets to continue growing because we plan to further leverage our existing bank branches  build two new de novo branches and one loan production office and actively pursue additional acquisitions of existing banks and bank branches 
we continue to seek means to enhance our core deposit market share through acquisitions and further branching to the extent our capital will enable us to do so 

table of contents loans our loan demand continues to be strong 
total loans increased from year end to year end and increased from year end to year end the increase in loans in is attributable to strong organic growth from the efforts of our branching and lending teams 
the increase in loans in is attributable to our acquisition of jackson bank which contributed approximately million and organic growth of million  which resulted from our branching efforts along with the efforts of our lending team 
the increase in loans in is attributable to our acquisition of kenesaw leasing and j s leasing which added approximately million and organic growth of million  which resulted from our branching efforts along with the efforts of our lending team 
we believe that general loan growth will remain strong 
funding of future loan growth may be restricted by our ability to raise core deposits  although we will use alternative funding sources if necessary and cost effective 
loan growth may also be restricted by the necessity for us to maintain appropriate capital levels  as well as adequate liquidity

at year end our loan portfolio was of total assets 
over the past few years  we have improved our commercial and retail underwriting standards  developed a detailed loan policy  established better warning and early detection procedures  additional credit related management and director reporting and developed a more comprehensive analysis of our allowance for loan losses 
during  we completed comprehensive retail loan underwriting training in conjunction with the implementation of our credit administration software platform 
our loan review process targets to of our portfolio for review over an eighteen month cycle 
more frequent loan reviews may be completed as needed or as directed by the audit corporate governance committee of the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate in relation to the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we analyze the loan portfolio regularly to identify potential problems 
we undertake this analysis in conjunction with the establishment of our allowance for loan losses to provide a basis for determining the adequacy of our loan loss reserves to absorb losses that we estimate might be experienced 
furthermore  our policy requires regularly scheduled problem asset meetings in which past due and classified loans are thoroughly analyzed 
these analyses are thoroughly reviewed by our credit administration group 
in addition to these analyses of existing loans  management considers our loan growth  historical loan losses  past due and non performing loans  current economic conditions  underlying loan collateral values and other factors which may affect possible loan losses 
our asset quality ratio of charge offs to average loans improved in as compared to in  loan charge offs decreased to million or basis points of average loans compared to million or basis points in the level was basis points more than fsgbank s peer group average of basis points as reported in the uniform bank performance report as of december  of the loans charged off in  approximately thousand in charge offs resulted from the borrower filing bankruptcy 
in  as a result of the acquisition of jackson bank  we assumed their allowance for loan losses of million  which related to loans that were not subject to the provisions of sop we believe that charge offs  as a percent of average loans  will decrease in barring continued increases in bankruptcies as a result of our continuing efforts to improve our loan underwriting  approval process  servicing  problem identification and problem resolution 
our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were basis points 
the largest components of non performing assets in and were non accrual loans and repossessed assets 
the increase in non accrual loans is attributable to five relationships  totaling million  which were reclassified as non accrual during the fourth quarter 
these relationships are secured by real estate and we do not anticipate any significant losses 
the increase in repossessed assets relates to our leasing companies  primarily kenesaw leasing 
we are actively marketing repossessions in order to maximize their value and minimize their carrying cost 
loans days past due increased from to the past due loans are reasonably collateralized  and in most cases  have guarantees 
during the fourth quarter of  we created a centralized collection department 
this department will aggressively collect the past due loans and manage the marketing of the repossessions and other real estate owned

the comprehensive allowance analysis developed by our credit administration group enables us to allocate the allowance based on risk elements within the portfolio

our assessment involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examinations  may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses in future periods if the results of their reviews warrant 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  other real estate under contract for sale and repossessed assets 
we place loans on non accrual status when we have concerns relating to our ability to collect the loan principal and interest  and generally when such loans are days or more past due 
nonaccrual loans totaled million  million and thousand as of december   and  respectively 
we earned interest of thousand  thousand and thousand on these loans during  and  respectively 
if these loans had been performing  we would have earned an additional thousand  thousand and thousand in  and  respectively 
we are not aware of any loans which represent material credits about which we are aware of any information which causes us to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their loan repayment terms 
no amount of loans that have been classified by regulatory examiners as loss  substandard  doubtful  or special mention has been excluded from amounts disclosed as nonperforming loans 
nonperforming assets represent potential losses to us  however  in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  we have measured the impairment of these loans and adjusted them to either the present value of expected future cash flows  the fair value of the collateral  or the observable market price 
loans days or more past due totaled million and consisted of thousand in leases  thousand in residential family mortgage loans  thousand in non farm nonresidential loans  thousand in consumer loans and thousand in commercial and industrial loans  
table of contents the million in other real estate owned consisted of thousand in vacant land and construction  thousand in residential real estate and thousand in nonfarm nonresidential property 
all of these properties have been written down to their respective fair values 
at december   we owned repossessed assets in the amount of million  compared to million at december  and compared to million at december  the increase in repossessed assets from years prior to is due to the acquisition of kenesaw leasing and j s leasing in october after engaging a consultant to evaluate the carrying values of our repossessions  we incurred a thousand fair value write down in the fourth quarter of subsequent to the write down  we implemented new leasing policies addressing repossessions 
we evaluate the fair market value at the date of repossession and on an ongoing basis 
write downs on repossessions held longer than days totaled thousand in we believe the value of repossessions at december  is representative of the lower of cost or market  and we do not see any significant losses

investment securities and other earning assets the composition of our securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
our securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for investing available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits and borrowed funds 
we use two categories to classify our securities held to maturity or available for sale 
currently  none of our investments are classified as held to maturity 
while we have no 
table of contents plans to liquidate a significant amount of any securities  the securities classified as available for sale may be used for liquidity purposes should management deem it to be in our best interest 
securities in our portfolio totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the securities portfolio is consistent as compared to in our efforts to maintain a certain level of liquid assets in correlation to our overall asset growth 
during the fourth quarter  we sold approximately million in securities with an average yield of to reduce our fhlb borrowing and eliminate negative interest spread 
at december  the securities portfolio had unrealized net losses  net of tax  of approximately thousand as compared to million at december  all investment securities purchased to date have been classified as available for sale

the bond is a thousand investment is a qualified zone academy bond within the meaning of section e of the internal revenue code of  as amended issued by the health  educational and housing facility board of the county of knox under the authority from the state of tennessee 
as of december   we owned securities from issuers in which the aggregate book value from such issuers exceeded of our stockholders equity 
as of year end  the book value and market value of the securities from each such issuer are as follows book value market value in thousands fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation at december   we had federal funds sold of million  compared to million at december  the decrease in federal funds sold as compared to is primarily due to our loan growth exceeding our core deposit growth 
as a result  we utilized the liquidity to assist in funding the loan growth 
as of december   we held thousand in certificates of deposit at other fdic insured financial institutions 
deposits and other borrowings deposits increased by million  or  from year end to year end due to our management team drawing customers away from other financial institutions and our branching efforts 
excluding the impact of brokered cd issuance and acquisitions  our organic growth rate of deposits was 
the fastest growing sectors of our core deposit base are retail cds and non interest bearing demand deposits  which both grew organically year over year 
we define core deposits to include interest bearing and non interest bearing demand deposits  savings and money market accounts  as well as retail certificates of deposit with denominations less than  we consider out retail cds to be a stable source of funding because they are in market  relationship oriented deposits 
core deposit growth is an important tenant to our business strategy 
we believe that by improving our branching network  we will provide more convenient opportunities for customers to bank with us  and thus improve our core deposit funding 
for this reason  in we plan to open two new de novo branches 
as a result of these future branches and the branches we opened in the past few years  we anticipate that our deposits will continue to increase in the table below is a maturity schedule for our certificates of deposit  including brokered cds  in amounts of thousand or more as of december  less than months three months to six months six months to twelve months greater than twelve months in thousands certificates of deposit of thousand or more

interest rate sensitivity financial institutions are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that their interest bearing liabilities consisting principally of customer deposits mature or reprice more or less frequently  or on a different basis  than their interest earning assets generally consisting of intermediate or long term loans  investment securities and fed funds sold 
the match between the scheduled repricing and maturities of our earning assets and liabilities within defined time periods is referred to as gap analysis 
at december   our cumulative one year gap was a negative or liability sensitive million  or of total earning assets 
this means our interest bearing liabilities are expected to reprice slightly faster than our interest earning assets under given market interest rate changes 
the change from a positive or asset sensitive million in is primarily due to our pricing on retail and jumbo cds 
the competitive environment of cds during increased rates faster than loan yields 
we priced rates competitively during while holding maturities to less than one year as we are anticipating a decrease in rates as these cds reprice during the following gap analysis provides information based on maturities 
the interest rate risk income sensitivity summary table  located in item a incorporates additional assumptions  including prepayments on loans and securities and reinvestments of paydowns and maturities of loans  investments  and deposits 
incorporating the additional assumptions  we remain asset sensitive 
we believe the income sensitivity summary table located in item a provides a more accurate analysis related to interest rate risk 
intense competition in our markets continues to pressure quality loan rates downward  while conversely pressuring deposit rates upward 
the following table reflects our rate sensitive assets and liabilities by maturity as of december  variable rate loans are shown in the category of due one to three months because they reprice with changes in the prime lending rate 
fixed rate loans are presented assuming the entire loan matures on the final due date  although payments are actually made at regular intervals and are not reflected in this schedule 
additionally  demand deposits and savings accounts have no stated maturity  however  it has been our experience that these accounts are not totally rate sensitive  and accordingly the following analysis assumes 
table of contents of interest bearing demand deposit accounts  of money market deposit accounts  and of savings accounts reprice within one year and the remaining accounts reprice within one to five years

we rely primarily on management service fees and dividends from fsgbank to fund our daily operations liquidity needs 
our cash balance on deposit with fsgbank  which totaled approximately million as of december   is available for funding activities for which fsgbank would not receive direct benefit  such as acquisition due diligence  shareholder relations  including dividends  and holding company reporting and operations 
these funds should adequately meet our cash flow needs 
if we determine that our cash flow needs will be satisfactorily met  we may deploy a portion of the funds into fsgbank or use them in an acquisition in order to support continued growth 
the liquidity of fsgbank refers to the ability or financial flexibility to adjust its future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and to fund operations on a timely and cost effective basis 
the primary sources of funds for fsgbank are cash generated by repayments of outstanding loans  interest payments on loans  and new deposits 
additional liquidity is available from the maturity and earnings on securities and liquid assets  as well as the ability to liquidate securities available for sale 
at december   our consolidated liquidity ratio defined as cash  due from banks  federal funds sold  and investment securities less securities pledged to liabilities divided by short term funding liabilities less liabilities pledged by securities was excluding anticipated loan repayments

as a member of the fhlb  fsgbank has attained short and long term borrowing capability secured by a blanket lien on its family residential mortgage loan portfolio  as well as the commercial real estate loan portfolio 
as of december   the outstanding overnight and term borrowings were million and million  respectively 
fsgbank also used its borrowing capacity at fhlb to purchase a letter of credit that we pledged to the state of tennessee bank collateral pool 
the letter of credit allows us to release investment securities from the collateral pool and thus improve our liquidity ratio 
additionally  fsgbank could increase its borrowing capacity at fhlb  subject to more stringent collateral requirements  by pledging loans other than family residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans 
as of december   our unused borrowing capacity using family residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans at fhlb was million 
fhlb maintains standards for loan collateral files 
therefore  our borrowing capacity may be restricted if our collateral file has exceptions  such as expired property insurance 
fsgbank also had unsecured federal funds lines in the aggregate amount of million at december  under which it can borrow funds to meet short term liquidity needs 
the federal funds lines were unused at year end 
another source of funding is loan participations sold to other commercial banks in which we retain the service rights 
as of year end  we had million in loan participations sold 
fsgbank may continue to sell loan participations as a source of liquidity 
we may also pledge investment securities against a line of credit at a commercial bank as an additional source of short term funding 
as of year end  we had no borrowings against our investment securities  except for repurchase agreements and public fund deposits attained in the ordinary course of business 
we utilize brokered cds to primarily match fund our leasing portfolio 
as of december   we had million in brokered cds outstanding with a weighted average remaining life of approximately months  a weighted average coupon rate of and a weighted average all in cost which includes fees paid to deposit brokers of 
our certificates of deposit greater than thousand were generated in our communities and are considered relatively stable 
management believes that our liquidity sources are adequate to meet its operating needs 
first security also has contractual cash obligations and commitments  which included certificates of deposit  other borrowings  operating leases and loan commitments 
unfunded loan commitments totaled million at year end 
the following table illustrates our significant contractual obligations at december  by future payment period 
contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years in thousands certificates of deposit federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase fhlb borrowings operating lease obligations note payable total certificates of deposit give customers rights to early withdrawal 
early withdrawals may be subject to penalties 
the penalty amount depends on the remaining time to maturity at the time of early withdrawal 
we expect securities repurchase agreements to be re issued and  as such  do not necessarily represent an immediate need for cash 

table of contents operating lease obligations include existing and future property and equipment non cancelable lease commitments 
this note payable is a mortgage on the land of our branch facility located at maynardville highway  maynardville  tennessee 
net cash provided by operations in total million compared to net cash provided by operations of million and million for and  respectively 
the change can be attributed to an increase in earnings combined with an increase in liabilities from to net cash used in investing activities increased to million in as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in can be attributed to the increase in the loan portfolio 
the increase in is attributable to the increase in the loan portfolio  the purchase of bank owned life insurance and the acquisition of jackson bank 
these increases were offset by proceeds from sales of other real estate and repossessions for both and net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the proceeds from our initial public offering of million in are the main cause of the fluctuations between the years 
our primary financing method continues to be increasing our deposits  which is a result of our sales and branching activities 
an increase in advances on other borrowing provided additional financing to support our loan growth 
these increases in financing activities were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock for the esop and cash dividends paid 
capital resources banks and bank holding companies  as regulated institutions  must meet required levels of capital 
the occ and the federal reserve board  the primary federal regulators for fsgbank and first security  respectively  have adopted minimum capital regulations or guidelines that categorize components and the level of risk associated with various types of assets 
financial institutions are expected to maintain a level of capital commensurate with the risk profile assigned to their assets in accordance with the guidelines 
first security and fsgbank both maintain capital levels exceeding the minimum capital levels required in addition to exceeding those capital requirements for well capitalized banks and holding companies under applicable regulatory guidelines 
the following table compares the required capital ratios maintained by first security and fsgbank 
december  well capitalized adequately capitalized first security fsgbank tier capital to risk adjusted assets total capital to risk adjusted assets leverage ratio december  well capitalized adequately capitalized first security fsgbank tier capital to risk adjusted assets total capital to risk adjusted assets leverage ratio effects of inflation inflation generally increases the cost of funds and operating overhead  and  to the extent loans and other assets bear variable rates  the yields on such assets 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
if the federal reserve board believes that the rate of inflation is likely to increase to undesired levels  its method of curbing inflation in the past has been to increase the interest rate charged on short term federal borrowings 

table of contents in addition  inflation results in an increased cost of goods and services purchased  cost of salaries and benefits  occupancy expense and similar items 
inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect the liquidity and earnings of our commercial banking and mortgage banking business  and our shareholders equity 
with respect to our mortgage banking business  mortgage originations and refinancings tend to slow as interest rates increase  and increased interest rates would likely reduce our earnings from such activities and the income from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to credit related financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit 
such commitments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments 
we follow the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
our maximum exposure to credit risk for unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit at december  and  was as follows in thousands commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of fees 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral  if any  we obtain on an extension of credit is based on our credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment and income producing commercial properties

in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  sop accounting for certain loans and debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows expected to be collected and an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
it includes loans and debt securities acquired in purchase business combinations 
sop limits the yield that may be accreted accretable yield to the excess of the investor s estimate of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected over the investor s initial investment in the loan 
sop requires that the excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows to be collected nonaccretable difference not be recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual or valuation allowance 
sop prohibits investors from displaying accretable yield and nonaccretable difference on the balance sheet 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life 
decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as an impairment 
sop prohibits carrying over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of sop the prohibition of the valuation allowance carryover applies to the purchase of an individual loan  a pool of loans  a group of loans  and loans acquired in a purchase business combination

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
the risk of loss can result in either lower fair market values or reduced net interest income 
although we manage other risk  such as credit and liquidity risks  management considers interest rate risk to be the more significant market risk and it could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition 
further  we believe the potential reduction of net interest income to be more significant than the effect of reduced fair market values 
we do not maintain a trading portfolio or deal in international instruments  and therefore are not exposed to risk inherent to trading activities and foreign currency 
our interest rate risk management is the responsibility of our board of directors asset liability committee 
the committee has established policies and limits for management to monitor  measure and coordinate our sources  uses  and pricing of funds 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense associated with our interest sensitive assets and liabilities also change  thereby impacting net interest income  the primary component of our earnings 
we utilize the results of both a static and dynamic gap report to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to a sustained change in interest rates 
the gap analysis projects net interest income based on both a rise and fall in interest rates of basis points ie over a twelve month period 
the model is based on actual repricing dates of interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets 

table of contents we measure this exposure based on an immediate change in interest rates of basis points up or down 
given this scenario  we had  at year end  an exposure to falling rates and a benefit from rising rates 
more specifically  the model forecasts a decline in net interest income of million or  as a result of a basis point decline in rates 
the model also predicts a million increase in net interest income  or  as a result of a basis point increase in rates 
the forecasted results of the model are within the limits specified by our guidelines 
the following chart reflects first security s sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  the model is based on a static balance sheet and assumes that paydowns and maturities of both assets and liabilities are reinvested in like instruments at current interest rates  rates down basis points  and rates up basis points 
interest rate risk income sensitivity summary down bp current up bp dollar amounts in thousands net interest income change net interest income change net interest income the preceding sensitivity analysis is a modeling analysis  which changes periodically and consists of hypothetical estimates based upon numerous assumptions including interest rate levels  shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  rates on loans and deposits  reinvestments of paydowns and maturities of loans  investments and deposits  and other assumptions 
in addition  there is no input for growth or a change in asset mix 
while assumptions are developed based on the current economic and market conditions  management cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ 
also  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
