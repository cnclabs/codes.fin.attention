as part of the restatement  we have also made adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and to correct errors identified for these fiscal years  which were not material to our financial statements in the aggregate or for any prior fiscal year 
previously filed annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q affected by the restatements have not been amended and should not be relied upon 
we first learned of the potential issues associated with our past stock option grants from a may  article published by the center for financial research and analysis cfra in which we were referenced as one of public companies with one or two stock grants between and that the cfra suggested were timed at  or close to  day lows in the applicable company s stock price or preceding a material change in our stock price 
promptly after learning of the cfra article  and prior to receiving the grand jury subpoena or the informal sec request described below  the ad hoc group  with the assistance of independent outside counsel  cleary gottlieb steen hamilton llp cleary gottlieb  began reviewing the facts and circumstances of the timing of our historical stock option grants for the period january to may relevant period 
we believe that the analysis was properly limited to the relevant period 
in addition to cleary gottlieb  the ad hoc group was assisted in its review by independent forensic accountants collectively the review team 
on june   we announced that we had received a grand jury subpoena from the us attorney for the northern district of california requesting documents relating to our stock option grants and practices dating back to january   and had received an informal request for information from the securities and exchange commission sec related to our stock option grants and practices 
on february   we subsequently received a formal order of investigation from the sec 
we are fully cooperating with the us attorney s investigation and the sec investigation 

table of contents on november   we announced that the ad hoc group had determined the need to restate our historical financial statements to record additional non cash  stock based compensation expense related to past stock option grants 
on march   we requested guidance from the office of the chief accountant of the sec the oca concerning certain accounting issues relating to the restatement of our historical financials and the review 
on june   we concluded our discussions with the oca regarding these accounting issues 
on may   we announced that stratton sclavos  our then current chairman and chief executive officer  had resigned from his position with verisign 
following mr 
sclavos resignation  the board elected director william a 
roper  jr 
as our president and ceo and edward mueller as our chairman of the board of directors 
on july   dana l 
evan  our then current executive vice president of finance and administration and chief financial officer  resigned from her position with verisign 
on july  and july   the board of directors appointed albert e 
clement chief accounting officer and executive vice president  finance and chief financial officer  respectively of the company 
the review team tested grants made on dates  incurred  person hours  searched more than million pages of physical and electronic documents and conducted interviews of current and former directors  officers  employees  and advisors 
we announced on january  that the ad hoc group s review was substantially completed and that  based on a review of the totality of evidence and the applicable law  the review did not find intentional wrongdoing by any current member of the senior management team or the former ceo 
the ad hoc group s review concluded that we failed to implement appropriate processes and controls for granting  accounting for  and reporting stock option grants and that corporate records in certain circumstances were incomplete or inaccurate 
the review team examined all grants to section officers and directors during the relevant period  as well as annual performance grants to rank and file employees and acquisition  new hire and promotion  and other grants to rank and file employees on dates from january through january the review team identified  stock option grants made on dates during the relevant period for which measurement dates were incorrectly determined 
the measurement dates required revision because the stated date either preceded or was subsequent to the proper measurement date and the stock price on the stated date was generally lower than the price on the proper measurement date 
in several instances  the review team also determined that the stock price assigned on the initial grant dates was subsequently modified  without being given the required accounting and disclosure treatment 
consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the sec  as part of the restatement  the grants during the relevant period were organized into categories based on grant type and process by which the grant was finalized 
the evidence related to each category of grant was analyzed including  but not limited to  electronic and physical documents  document metadata  and witness interviews 
based on the relevant facts and circumstances  and consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the sec  the controlling accounting standards were applied to determine  for every grant within each category  the proper measurement date 
if the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date  accounting adjustments were made as required  resulting in stock based compensation expense and related income tax effects 

table of contents measurement date hierarchy we have adopted the following framework for determining the measurement dates of our stock option grants and have applied this framework to each grant based on the facts  circumstances and availability of documentation 
we reviewed the date of the minutes of the board of directors or compensation committee meetings for grants made at such meetings when the number of options and exercise price for each recipient had been clearly approved 
where the review team determined that the meeting date was not the measurement date  the review team determined the actual date of approval of the grant via other documentary evidence and interviews 
when a grant was approved by unanimous written consent uwc  the measurement date was the date of the compensation committee s approval of the uwc as established by available evidence  such as receipt of signature pages of the uwc  contemporaneous telephone and or e mail communications 
if a grant was approved by the ceo under authority delegated by the compensation committee  the measurement date was the date on which the ceo communicated approval to the human resources department  the compensation committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price 
if a grant was approved by the ceo based on the mistaken belief that he had delegated authority to do so de facto or substantive authority  the measurement date was the date on which the ceo communicated approval to either the human resources department  the compensation committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price 
in the event the date on which the ceo communicated approval was not evident from the approval forms  the measurement date was the date on which other available evidence  such as the surrounding e mail communications  established the date the ceo approved the grant 
in the event the date of ceo approval could not be established by reviewing other available evidence  such as e mails  the measurement date was the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into our option tracking database equity edge 
except for grants to section officers which require compensation committee approval  for new hire grants and promotion grants  prior to march   the measurement date was the date the compensation committee approved the grant as described above 
for new hire grants and promotion grants after march  and prior to september and after september   the measurement date was the th day or the last day of the month or the prior business day if that day was not a business day following the actual and documented start date or promotion date of the respective employee receiving the grant 
new hire grants and promotion grants made in the period september  through september  required ceo approval 
for new hire grants and promotion grants in the period september  through september   the measurement date was the date on which the ceo communicated approval to either the human resources department  the compensation committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price 
if that date could not be determined  the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into equity edge 
after determining the measurement date through the steps in the above measurement date hierarchy  we then determined if there were any changes to the individual recipients  exercise prices or amount of shares granted after such measurement date 
if there were no changes following such measurement date  then that date would be used 
if we identified changes following such measurement date  then we would evaluate whether the changes should delay the measurement date for the entire list of grants on that date  result in a repricing  or result in separate accounting for specific grants 

table of contents director grants required granting actions grants to directors under the director plan the director plan were automatic and non discretionary  the director plan did not require the ceo  the board or the compensation committee to review or approve director grants 
each new director received an initial grant of a specified number of options on the date of his or her appointment and annually on the anniversary of the initial grant to be priced on the appointment or anniversary date  respectively 
directors serving before the director plan was adopted received an annual grant on the anniversary of their previous grant 
method for determining proper measurement dates for the initial grant  the measurement date was the date the director was appointed to the board  as reflected in board minutes 
in the absence of board minutes  the date specified in the proxy statement or  if not clear  the date of the first board meeting attended by the new director 
for anniversary grants  annually on the date of the initial grant or the next business day if such date was not a business day 
executive grants required granting actions the compensation committee is required to approve all grants to executive officers 
for grants to the former ceo  the review team concluded that  in all but three cases including the february grant described below  the compensation committee or the board of directors approved the grant on the stated grant date  resulting in a correct measurement date 
method for determining proper measurement dates for grants other than the february may grant described below  including the other two grants to the former ceo referred to above  please refer to the measurement date hierarchy above 
acquisition grants required granting actions ceo authorization required 
the board of directors implicitly delegated to the ceo authority to approve grants to employees from acquisitions when the board approved an acquisition 
method for determining proper measurement dates refer to the measurement date hierarchy above 
annual refresh grants required granting actions the compensation committee was required to approve all annual refresh grants through and including the annual refresh grant 
in  the compensation committee delegated to the ceo the authority to approve rank and file annual refresh grants 
method for determining proper measurement dates refer to the measurement date hierarchy above 
extended grants required granting actions the compensation committee or the board of directors is required to approve all extensions of grants 
method for determining proper measurement dates extended grants are a modification of a previous award 
available documentation was used to establish the modification date and to measure the additional compensation charge 
retention and off cycle grants required granting actions the compensation committee is required to approve all retention and off cycle grants 

table of contents method for determining proper measurement dates refer to the documentation hierarchy above 
for the february may retention grant described below  the former ceo approved the grants to rank and file employees 
new hire and promotion grants required granting actions new hire grants and promotion grants made after march  and prior to september and those made after september  were automatic and did not require the ceo  the board or the compensation committee review or approval 
prior to march   the compensation committee was required to approve all new hire and promotion grants 
new hire grants and promotion grants made in the period september  through september  required ceo approval 
method for determining proper measurement dates refer to the measurement date hierarchy above 
the  grants previously identified as having incorrectly determined measurement dates were classified into the following six categories grants on dates to persons elected or appointed as members of the board of directors director grants  grants to executive officers executive grants   grants to employees issued after an acquisition  newly hired employees and promoted employees under the new hire and promotion grants program described below new hire and promotion grants program  and other grants to a large number of non executives   grants made in broad based awards to large numbers of employees  usually on an annual basis annual refresh grants  off cycle performance grants  and grants whereby the expiration dates were extended extended grants 
all references to the number of option shares  option exercise prices  and share prices have been adjusted for all subsequent stock splits 
as discussed below  it was determined that the originally assigned grant dates for  grants were not ascribed the proper measurement dates for accounting purposes 
accordingly  after accounting for forfeitures  stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis was recognized over the respective awards vesting terms for the periods from to as noted below  we also considered alternative measurement dates for eight grant dates which  if applied  would have resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
the adjustments made to reflect the proper measurement dates for accounting purposes and the financial statement impact of the alternative measurement dates considered by us  were determined by category as follows director grants director grants were made on dates during the relevant period 
of the grants  there were grants to directors for which it was determined that the originally determined grant dates preceded or succeeded the measurement dates  grants were in excess of plan parameters  and some of the dates were selected in hindsight based on an advantageous share price 
of the grants with measurement date issues  of the grants involved periods of days or less and resulted in a stock based compensation expense of less than  in the aggregate 
revisions to measurement dates for director grants were made where the wrong date was selected based on the requirements of the director plan and where incorrect start dates were used for the date the director joined the board of directors 
the excess grants have been historically honored by us 
as a result  million of stock based compensation expense was recognized 
executive officer grants it was determined that for of the grants to executive officers  the originally determined grant dates preceded the measurement dates or the grant dates and exercise prices were subsequently changed 
some of these dates were selected in hindsight based on an advantageous share price 
as the stock prices on the originally determined grant dates were lower than the stock prices on the proper measurement date  million of stock based compensation expense was recognized 
the revised measurement dates for various executive officer grants were based on compensation committee meeting dates  signed uwcs  delayed ceo approval  and for one date the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into equity edge 
we also considered an alternative measurement date for one grant date which would have increased the compensation expense by approximately  for that grant 
the authority for grants  which have been historically honored by us  is based on the ceo s presumed authority 

table of contents new hire and promotion grants program we concluded that the new hire and promotion grants made pursuant to the new hire and promotion grants program within the pre established guidelines did not require an adjustment  with the exception of the grants made from september  to september  for the  grants made during that time period  management concluded that the measurement dates occurred only on the dates of the ceo approval 
due to practical difficulties in ascertaining the actual dates of the ceo approval for many new hire and promotion grants in that time period  the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into equity edge 
the incremental stock based compensation expense associated with the new hire and promotion grants during the relevant period was million 
acquisition grants after the consummation of certain acquisitions  we granted stock options to employees of the acquired entities 
it was determined that the measurement dates for  option grants required revision because the stated grant dates preceded the proper measurement dates and the approval authority was based on ceo approval 
some of these dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price 
of the  grants   grants were extinguished as part of our exchange program which commenced in november due to issues associated with the measurement dates for the acquisition grants  million of additional stock based compensation expense was recognized during the relevant period 
we also considered an alternative measurement date for three different acquisition grant dates which  if they had been used  would have increased the compensation expense by approximately  annual refresh grants during the relevant period   broad based grants were made to employees under an annual program the refresh grants for which the originally assigned grant dates were not the proper measurement dates 
some of these dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price  and the authority for some of the refresh grants was the ceo s presumed authority 
for one of the annual refresh grants which occurred in august  there was conflicting documentation and inconclusive evidence with respect to the measurement date 
it was determined that the most appropriate measurement date  due to the lack of affirmative evidence otherwise  was the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into equity edge  and based on that date  million of stock based compensation expense was recognized in the period to these grants were extinguished in december as part of our exchange program which commenced in november we did not approve or process any stock option grants to existing employees during the period of the tender offer or agree or imply that we would compensate employees for any increases in the market price during the tender period 
the review also determined that the annual refresh grants for the years    and a portion of the grant had a measurement date that was later than the date that was originally used 
in these cases  where the measurement dates were revised  the authority for the grants varied and included new dates based on uwcs by the compensation committee or approvals by the ceo 
where approval was not determinable based on the above  we utilized the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into equity edge 
due to the errors in measurement dates associated with the annual refresh grants  stock based compensation expense of million was recognized 
we also considered alternative measurement dates for two refresh grants which did not create additional compensation charge where one alternative measurement date had a lower price than the original grant date and the options for the second alternative measurement date were cancelled prior to the one year cliff vesting date 
off cycle performance grants there were performance grants made to employees on march  and october  these dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price  and the authority for these grants was the ceo s de facto authority 
the revised measurement dates were based on the dates of the uwc for the march  grant and e mail correspondence for the october  grant 
due to the errors in measurement dates associated with the off cycle performance grants  stock based compensation expense of million was recognized 
we also considered an alternative measurement date for the october  grant which  if it had been used  would have decreased the compensation expense by approximately  for that grant 
extended grants during the relevant period  there were stock option extensions including one to the former ceo described below whereby an option was extended beyond its expiration or termination date and for 
table of contents which a compensation charge had not been recorded 
as a result  million of stock based compensation expense was recognized 
the former ceo received certain options from network solutions  inc nsi in his capacity as a nsi director prior to our acquisition of nsi 
upon receiving legal advice  management extended the term of those options beyond their original expiration date 
the former ceo exercised those options on may  the ad hoc group reviewed the extension of these options and determined that the legal advice was incorrect and that the options should not have been extended 
upon learning of this determination in january  the former ceo voluntarily paid us  reflecting the after tax net profit he received from the exercise of those options 
retention grants between february and may  the compensation committee considered special option grants as a retention incentive for executive officers and other executives and key employees  since in many cases the exercise prices of options previously granted to these individuals were significantly above the then current market price for shares of our common stock 
these retention grants are summarized as follows grants to executive officers and other executives we determined that grants of options for a total of  shares to executive officers and other executives were finalized on april  rather than the stated grant date of february  the review team was unable  after review of detailed documentation  including multiple draft versions of the february  compensation committee minutes  approval forms which were undated and email correspondence  to affirmatively determine when the grants to executive officers and other executives were approved 
in accordance with our measurement date hierarchy for grants described above  we determined that april  was the correct measurement date because that was the date that other grants  including certain executive grants  were entered into equity edge 
the grant price as of the measurement date was  the closing market price of our stock on april  because the stated exercise price of the grants was set based on the closing market price on february  of and preceded the measurement date  an incremental million of stock based compensation expense was recognized 
we also determined that the compensation committee repriced  of these options on may   with an exercise price of  the closing market price of our stock on may  we determined that these grants were a reprice based on a uwc of the compensation committee 
the accounting impact of the repricing was not recorded at the time of the compensation committee approval and we did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants 
in accordance with fin and after applying variable accounting  we recognized incremental stock based compensation expense of approximately million  net of reversals  for the periods between and had we considered an alternative measurement date between the periods from february  through april   compensation expense would have increased by up to million for these grants 
grants to employees broad based employee grants were also considered during the february to may period 
the review team determined that the ceo  under his presumed authority  approved broad based employee grants on or about march  with a grant price of  the closing market price of our stock on that date 
these awards were communicated shortly thereafter to the employees 
we determined that march  was a definitive measurement date for the awards to the employees 
the grants to employees previously approved by the ceo on march  were submitted for approval to the compensation committee as evidenced in a uwc dated may  the compensation committee approved the employee grants with an exercise price of  the market value of our common stock on may  therefore the employee awards were re priced on that date 
although the awards had been communicated to the employees and disclosed in our form q for the first quarter of  the accounting impact of the repricing was not recorded at the time of the compensation committee approval and we did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants 
as a result of the repricing  and after applying variable accounting  approximately million  net of reversals of additional stock based compensation expense  has been recorded for the periods between and 
table of contents retention grants to our former ceo in the february  compensation committee meeting  the committee considered the number and vesting period of a proposed option award to the ceo 
the review team found multiple draft versions of the minutes for the february  meeting of the compensation committee and concluded that the signed minutes were inaccurate 
attendees at the meeting have different recollections of the business conducted 
one draft  unapproved version of those minutes  stated the number of options to be awarded to the ceo was  while the signed version of the minutes approved by the members of the compensation committee in late may stated that the number of options to be awarded was  both versions of the minutes stated that the grant date and the exercise price was february  and 
the minutes of a board meeting held on february   after the compensation committee meeting  also indicate that the ceo was awarded  options at the february  compensation committee meeting 
we have determined that the measurement date for the  options to the ceo was february  with a grant price of  the closing market price of our stock on that date  and that the options were repriced on february  with a grant price of  the closing market price of our stock on that date 
subsequently   options of the  options were repriced on may  with a grant price of  the closing market price of our stock on that date 
the accounting impact of the repricings was not recorded at the time of the compensation committee approval and we did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants 
as a result of the repricing  and after applying variable accounting  approximately million  net of reversals  of additional stock based compensation expense has been recorded for the periods between and actions taken by the board with respect to grants as part of the review  the board of directors confirmed all option grants including those to our former ceo and cfo that the review team concluded had authority issues as legally binding and enforceable obligations of the company as of the date of such grant 
in addition  the board of directors decided to modify the following grants to the former ceo and cfo in and no reversal of compensation expense was recorded for these negative modifications in the financial statements 
former ceo an option grant to the former ceo of  shares originally dated december  at an exercise price of was modified to a new exercise price of 
former ceo the february option grant to the former ceo of  shares originally dated february  at an exercise price of was modified to a new exercise price of 
former cfo an option grant to the cfo of  shares originally dated december  at an exercise price of was modified to a new exercise price of 
former cfo an option grant to the cfo of  shares originally dated august  at an exercise price of was modified to a new exercise price of 
former cfo an option grant to the cfo of  shares originally dated march  at an exercise price of was modified to a new exercise price of 
the cfo s a tax election described below modified  of these options and the board of directors determined to modify the remaining  options 
former cfo a grant to the cfo of  shares originally dated september  at an exercise price of was modified to a new exercise price of 
the cfo s a tax election described below modified  of these options and the board of directors determined to modify the remaining  options 
former cfo the february option grant to the cfo of  shares originally dated february  at an exercise price of was modified to a new exercise price of 
other the company and the review team also determined that the former ceo received an option grant in october for  shares  non qualified stock options nqsos and  incentive stock 
table of contents options isos  which split to options for  shares in may and then split again to options for  shares in november when we announced a stock split during those respective periods 
the account statements and monthly reporting statements for november and december  showed that the former ceo held options for  shares at the split adjusted price of 
however  the ad hoc group determined that sometime between december  and january   we erroneously changed the former ceo s options to reflect the pre split amount of  shares instead of  shares  but at the post split price of 
the error was never subsequently corrected 
therefore  the former ceo did not receive the benefit of the additional  options arising from the two stock splits  which expired in based on a determination by the board of directors after the ad hoc group s review in may  we have agreed to pay the former ceo  reflecting the gain he would have realized from the exercise of these options prior to their expiration  based on the weighted average price of stock options exercised by the former ceo in august the other principal factual findings of the review included the following the human resources  accounting  and legal departments failed to implement appropriate processes and controls 
during through  the option grant process was characterized by a high degree of informality and relatively little oversight 
the review found no evidence that accounting personnel were aware of the deficient practices used in selecting grant dates 
the review found instances of incomplete and inaccurate corporate records  including two sets of committee minutes that were inaccurate 
the review found no evidence of fictitious individuals being granted options 
options found to be misdated  have a date chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price  repriced  or unauthorized with a stated exercise price lower than the share price at the actual approval date will result in adverse tax consequences to the recipients and us 
in light of the review s other findings  our disclosures related to option grants were inaccurate in some respects 
the principal recommendations of the ad hoc group s review included the following the board or the compensation committee should approve all grants that the review found to be unauthorized  with the exception of certain grants made to our former ceo and cfo 
the board or the compensation committee should consider whether to cancel or request forfeiture of any options granted to the former ceo and cfo that were determined to be unauthorized  misdated  have a date chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price  or repriced  and then should consider the appropriate equity compensation for these officers for the periods covered by the review 
we should develop and implement detailed written grant policies 
we should designate individuals in the legal and accounting departments to oversee the documentation of and accounting for option grants 
we should develop and implement improved training and controls relating to option granting practices to ensure that all personnel involved in the granting and administration of stock options understand the relevant option plans and accounting  tax  and disclosure requirements 
we should award regular grants new hire  promotion  and annual performance at predetermined dates and with all approvals documented and finalized on those dates 
the board has adopted all of the review s findings and recommendations 
under the direction of the audit committee and the compensation committee  and with the assistance of pricewaterhousecoopers llp  we have implemented or are in the process of implementing the recommendations 

table of contents based on the results of the review  we have recorded additional non cash stock based compensation expense benefit net of related income tax effects related to past stock option grants of million for the first quarter ended march   million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
these adjustments were recorded based on the evidence and findings from the ad hoc group s review  including analysis of the measurement dates for the  stock option grants made on dates during the relevant period that the review determined were incorrect 
the incremental impact from recognizing stock based compensation expense resulting from the ad hoc group s review of past stock option grants is as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year as restated as previously reported pre tax expense income adjustments after tax income expense adjustments total impact total pre tax expense adjustments are through march  and represents amounts being reported pursuant to fas r whereas amounts for all other years represent amounts being reported pursuant to apb includes million of other stock based compensation adjustments that were unrelated to past stock option grants

in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k has been restated to reflect the impact of these adjustments for the years ended december  and december  as noted above we considered alternative measurement dates for eight grants which  if applied  would have resulted in additional stock based compensation of approximately million 
with the exception of these eight grants  there was no uncertainty on the measurement date for option grants 
the table below shows what the incremental impact to stock based compensation expense would have been by category of grant had these alternative measurement dates been applied in thousands category pre tax expense income director grants executive grants acquisition grants annual refresh grants extended grants retention and off cycle grants new hire and promotion grants retention grants total 
table of contents tax implications we evaluated the impact of the restatements on our global tax provision and have determined that a portion of the tax benefit relating to stock based compensation expense formerly associated with stock option deductions is attributable to continuing operations 
we identified deferred tax assets totaling million at december  which reflect the benefit of tax deductions from future employee stock option exercises 
we have not realized this or any other deferred tax asset relating to taxing jurisdictions within the united states as of december  we also believe that we should not have taken a tax deduction under internal revenue code irc section m in prior years for stock option related amounts pertaining to certain executives 
section m limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds 
as a result  our tax net operating losses associated with the stock option intra period allocation have decreased by million 
we continue to apply a valuation allowance to our tax net operating losses relating to stock options exercised prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
pursuant to footnote of sfas no 
r  we recognize financial statement benefit of these tax net operating losses when such losses reduce cash taxes paid 
section a of the internal revenue code section a imposes significant penalties on individual income taxpayers who were granted stock options that were unvested as of december  and that have an exercise price of less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant affected options 
these tax consequences include income tax at vesting  an additional tax and interest charges 
in addition  the issuer of affected options must comply with certain reporting and withholding obligations under section a 
these adverse tax consequences may be avoided for unexercised affected options if the exercise price of the affected option is adjusted to reflect the fair market value at the time the option was granted as such measurement date is determined for financial reporting purposes 
under treasury regulations  affected options held by executive officers or directors were to be amended on or before december  to avoid the adverse tax consequences of section a  holders of affected options who are not our executive officers or directors have until december  to amend their affected options to avoid the adverse tax consequences of section a 
four of our current and former executive officers and a current director holding affected options elected to increase the exercise price of their affected options to the market price on december  effective december   the exercise prices of affected options held by d 
james bidzos  a current board member  dana evan  former chief financial officer  robert korzeniewski  executive vice president of corporate development  judy lin  former executive vice president of security services and mark mclaughlin  executive vice president of products  marketing and customer support  were adjusted so that these options will not be subject to section a 
we are currently considering actions to avoid or alleviate certain of the adverse tax consequences associated with affected options for employees who are not executive officers of the company and whether to offer compensation to the executive officers and director who elected to increase the exercise price of their affected options as of december  should we decide to take actions to avoid or alleviate these adverse tax consequences associated with current and former employees outstanding affected options  we estimate the related compensatory payments would be approximately million 
in june  we made payments of approximately million on behalf of current and former employees who exercised affected options in under the irs and california franchise tax board a compliance resolution programs 
we estimate the cost to participate in these compliance resolution programs  including a gross up payment to the affected employees  will be approximately million 
other matters as part of the restatement  we made other adjustments to previously stated financial statements back to these adjustments include corrections to revenue  expenses  other income and related income tax adjustments 
the adjustments mentioned below are in addition to the recognition of additional stock compensation expense resulting from the stock option investigation 

table of contents in  we recorded a million charge to stock compensation expense that was previously recorded in the first quarter of as part of our stock option investigation  we were required to record additional payroll tax expense for the periods affected by the restatement 
although the statute for such taxes is closed through  we recorded the additional payroll tax as if the statute were open  and then reversed the accrual for payroll tax when the statute closed 
we recorded additional immaterial expenses in and and reduced payroll tax expense by million and million in and  respectively 
as part of the restructuring activities  we had one significant leased property for which real estate taxes and utilities costs were not properly accounted for at the time of the restructuring 
the adjustment resulted in an increase in accrued restructuring costs of million in approximately million of this adjustment was later released in as part of the building was subleased to a third party and million was released in when the remainder of the space was assumed by another tenant directly with the landlord 
during  we adjusted the interest amortization on the note receivable from network solutions 
this item was the result of adjusting the interest rate on the loan to a market rate 
it was determined that this adjustment would have increased other income in the fourth quarter of by million 
we originally booked the additional million gain in  which has since been reversed 
as a part of our internal control processes during  we detected an error related to the accounting for software maintenance amortization for various software license arrangements acquired from vendors 
as a result of this error  we increased software maintenance expenses by  in  million in and million in the first quarter of during  we detected two errors related to the accounting at our jamba subsidiary in berlin  germany 
the first error relates to the accounting for insurance revenues recorded after jamba was acquired 
we did not properly account for insurance renewal premiums on contracts that were renewed after the acquisition 
the second error relates to the timing of certain revenues  which were booked in incorrect periods 
the combined impact of these errors increased revenues million in  million in and  in the first quarter of in the first quarter of  we reversed million of revenue to account for billed services that were not delivered under contractual terms

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  long lived assets  restructuring and stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided 
our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events 
revenues from consulting services are recognized either on a time and materials basis as the services are performed  or for fixed price consulting as services are performed  completed and accepted 
in some cases fixed price consulting is measured using the proportional performance method of accounting 
proportional performance is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project 
we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects 
if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made  then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed 
revenues from time and materials are recognized as services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance 
table of contents after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category 
we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable  or approximately million 
a change of in our estimate would amount to approximately million 
the following table shows a comparison of our bad debt expense for  and change change dollars in thousands bad debt recovery expense valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment 
we review  at least annually  goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review long lived assets  including certain identifiable intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount in accordance with sfas such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 
recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled approximately billion at december   which was comprised of billion of goodwill and billion of other intangible assets 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  technology in place  carrier relationships  non compete agreements  trade names  and other 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired  an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations  of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
it is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our long lived intangible assets including goodwill 
restructuring  impairment and other charges reversals  net in november  we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units 
in april  we initiated plans to restructure our operations to fully 
table of contents rationalize  integrate and align our resources 
both plans resulted in reductions in workforce  abandonment of excess facilities  disposal of property and equipment and other charges 
we expect these restructuring plans to be completed in upon the expiration of our lease obligations for abandoned facilities 
restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space  including the potential for sublease income 
estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented  the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property 
these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located  such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates 
changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis  as necessary 
during  we recorded net restructuring reversals of approximately million primarily related to excess facilities as a result of reductions in lease obligations 
such estimates will likely be revised in the future 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of  and accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board s fasb sfas r 
we elected the modified prospective application method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified 
for stock based awards granted on or after january   we will amortize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation costs estimated for the sfas pro forma disclosures 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and or cancellations 
expected volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility of our common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options and the mean historical implied volatility from traded options 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share

in previous fiscal years  we provided a tax valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets based on our evaluation that realizability of such assets was not more likely than not 
we continuously evaluated additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
such deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  temporary differences on tax deductible goodwill and intangibles  and temporary differences on deferred revenue 
in the quarter ended june   based on additional evidence regarding our past earnings  scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income from operating activities  we determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets would be realized 
accordingly  we released our valuation allowance of million from our deferred tax assets resulting in a credit to statement of income 
we continue to assess the future realization of net deferred tax assets and believe that it is more likely than not that forecasted income  tax effects of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income from operating activities will be sufficient to support future realization of net deferred tax assets 
however  we continue to apply a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets which we do not believe are more likely than not that they would be realized 
we continue to apply a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to capital loss carryforwards and to book write downs of investments  due to the limited 
table of contents carryforward period and character of such tax attributes 
the amount of this deferred tax asset which continues to be subject to a valuation allowance was million as of june   the date on which we released the valuation allowance on federal and state deferred tax assets  and million as of december  as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  including federal and state net operating losses related to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock awards of million and million respectively  when recognized  will result in a benefit to additional paid in capital of million 
as of december   we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
if we are not able to use our federal net operating loss carryforwards  they will expire in through and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through most of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire  but could be subject to future restrictions based on changes in the business or ownership of the foreign subsidiary 
as of december   we had federal research and experimentation tax credits available for future years of approximately million  state research and experimentation tax credits available for future years of approximately million 
included in these amounts are million of federal  and million of state research credit carryforwards generated from stock option exercises prior to the adoption of sfas r 
the future utilization of these attributes will result in recognition of the asset and a benefit to additional paid in capital 
the federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire  if not utilized  in through state research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation s ownership change  as defined in the internal revenue code 
we experienced cumulative changes in ownership of greater than percent in and these changes in ownership resulted in the imposition of an annual limitation on our ability to utilize certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
losses not utilized due to these limitations can be carried forward  but are subject to the expiration dates described in the paragraph above 
deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of such earnings included in consolidated retained earnings at december  was million 
these earnings have been permanently reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on the foreign earnings 
in the quarter ended june   we were granted relief from the irs for an uncertainty regarding a tax benefit resulting from a prior divestiture 
as a result  we recorded an income tax benefit million  increased our deferred tax asset for net operating losses from continuing operations million  and reduced income taxes payable million 
our effective rate in differs from primarily because of the reduction in our valuation allowance  the aforementioned reversal of a tax uncertainty and the implementation of a new global business structure 
our new international business structure is being implemented to align our asset ownership and business operations with our newly announced functional business structure and the business needs of the our global customers 
in future years  we expect to achieve a lower effective tax rate  as well as business efficiencies  as a result of this new international business structure

recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets or financial liabilities which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and 
table of contents liabilities at fair value 
the objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
we are currently evaluating the effect of sfas and the impact it will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier adoption is permitted  provided we have not yet issued financial statements  including for interim periods  for that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the effect of sfas and the impact it will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab provides transition guidance for correcting errors and requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative factors 
in the year of adoption only  if the effect of prior periods uncorrected misstatement is determined to be material  under sab a registrant is allowed to record the effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings 
sab does not change the requirements within sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections for the correction of an error on financial statements 
further  sab does not change the staff s previous guidance in sab no 
 materiality  on evaluating the qualitative materiality of misstatements 
we were required to adopt sab in our current fiscal year 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
the recently issued literature also provides guidance on the recognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
we are required to adopt fin in the first quarter of the differences between the amounts recognized in the financial statements prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit 
we have evaluated the effect of fin  and we believe that adoption of this accounting principle will result in a decrease to our accumulated deficit in the first quarter of of million  an increase to non current deferred tax assets of million  and a decrease to income taxes payable of million 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement 
eitf provides guidance on an entity s disclosure of its accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of certain taxes and provides that if taxes included in gross revenues are significant  a company should disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented ie  both interim and annual periods 
taxes within the scope of eitf are those that are imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning 
table of contents after december  we have evaluated the effect of eitf  and we believe the impact will be immaterial on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk equity investments we invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for investment purposes 
in most instances  we invest in the equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market  and therefore  carry a high level of risk 
these companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near term 
therefore  these companies may never become publicly traded 
even if they do  an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments 
in  and  we determined the decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized impairments totaling million  million  and million  respectively 
due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  we may incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our short term investment management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving after tax returns 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities 
we invest in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate bonds and notes  us government and agency securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   of our investments subject to interest rate risk mature in less than one year 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
at any time  a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of our fixed income securities in our short term investment portfolio as of december   arising from potential changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  bps  and bps 
uniform decrease in rates uniform increase in rates bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps in thousands the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk

table of contents foreign exchange risk management we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies 
as we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies 
the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates 
the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than months 
at december   we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies 
all forward contracts are recorded at fair market value 
we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with high quality financial institutions
