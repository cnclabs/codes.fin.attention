under these arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of the company s losses and loss adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums 
see reinsurance 
accordingly  the profitability of group employee benefit products is affected by the amount  cost and terms of reinsurance obtained by the company 
the profitability of those group employee benefit products for which reserves are discounted is also affected by the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
the table below shows the loss and expense ratios as a percent of premium income for the company s group employee benefit products for the periods indicated

the company s group long term disability coverages are spread across many industries 
typically  long term disability benefits are paid monthly and are limited for any one insured to two thirds of the insured s earned income up to a specified maximum benefit 
long term disability benefits are usually offset by income the claimant receives from other sources  primarily social security disability benefits 
the company actively manages its disability claims  working with claimants in an effort to assist them in returning to work as quickly as possible 
when claimants disabilities prevent them from returning to their original occupations  the company  in appropriate cases  may provide assistance in developing new productive skills for an alternative career 
following the initial premium rate guarantee period for a new policy  typically two years in length  premium rates are generally re determined annually for disability insurance and are based upon expected morbidity and mortality and the insured group s emerging experience  as well as assumptions regarding operating expenses and future interest rates 
in april  rslic purchased substantially all of the assets of a third party administrator which had previously been administering business for rslic and contributed them to a newly established division of rslic  custom disability solutions cds

cds  the operations of which are based in south portland  maine  is focused on expanding the company s presence in the turnkey group disability reinsurance market  while also continuing to service existing clients from an indemnity reinsurance arrangement 
turnkey group disability reinsurance is typically provided to other insurance companies that would not otherwise have the capability of providing to their clients a group disability insurance product to complement their other product offerings

excess workers compensation insurance products provide coverage against workers compensation risks to employers and groups who self insure such risks 
the coverage applies to losses in excess of the applicable self insured retentions sirs or deductibles of employers and groups  whose workers compensation claims are generally handled by third party administrators tpas 
these products are principally targeted to mid sized companies and other employers  particularly small municipalities  hospitals and schools 
these employers are believed to be less prone to catastrophic workers compensation exposures and less price sensitive than larger account business 
because claim payments under the company s excess workers compensation products do not begin until after the self insured s total loss payments equal the sir  the period from when the claim is incurred to the time the company s claim payments begin averages years 
at that point  the payments are primarily for wage replacement  similar to the benefit provided under long term disability coverage  and any medical payments tend to be relatively more stable and predictable in nature than at the inception of the workers compensation claim 
this family of products also includes large deductible workers compensation insurance  which provides coverage similar to excess workers compensation insurance  and a complementary product  workers compensation self insurance bonds 
the pricing environment and demand for excess workers compensation insurance has improved substantially since due to high primary workers compensation rates and disruption in the excess workers compensation marketplace resulting from difficulties experienced by some competitors  particularly during these trends accelerated during the second half of as sharply higher primary workers compensation rates and rising reinsurance costs due to the september th terrorist attacks increased the demand for alternatives to primary workers compensation 
as a result  the demand for excess workers compensation insurance products and the rates for such products continued to increase significantly through the cumulative effect of these rate increases during through was an increase of 
sncc was able to maintain its pricing in its renewals of insurance coverage during and and also obtained significant improvements in contract terms in new and renewal policies written in those years  in particular higher sir levels 
on average  sirs increased in each of and and in sncc has substantially maintained its pricing on its renewals and sir levels on average are up modestly in new and renewal policies  excluding the canadian policies referenced below

new business production for and benefited from a renewal rights agreement into which sncc entered in july under the agreement  sncc acquired  among other things  the right to offer renewal quotes to expiring excess workers compensation policies of a former competitor 
excess workers compensation new business production for the important january renewal season increased to million in from million in  excluding production of million relating to policies written under the renewal rights agreement during the january new business production total includes million related to policies written in canada under such renewal rights agreement

in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the september th terrorist attacks  a number of the company s reinsurers have excluded coverage for losses resulting from terrorism 
in november  the terrorism risk insurance act of the terrorism act was enacted 
the terrorism act established a program under which the federal government will share with the insurance industry the risk of loss from covered acts of international terrorism 
in december  congress passed the terrorism risk insurance extension act of extending  with certain modifications  the terrorism act  which otherwise would have expired at the end of  for an additional two year term through december  the terrorism act applies to lines of property and casualty insurance directly written by sncc as opposed to business assumed by sncc through reinsurance  including excess workers compensation 
sncc s surety line of business is not covered under the terrorism act after december  the federal government would pay of each covered loss in and the insurer would pay the remaining  respectively 
each insurer has a separate deductible before federal assistance becomes available for a covered act of terrorism 
the deductible is based on a percentage of the insurer s direct earned premiums from the previous calendar year 
such percentage will be in the maximum after tax loss to the company for within the terrorism act deductible from property and casualty products is approximately of the company s shareholders equity as of december  any payments made by the federal government under the terrorism act would be subject to recoupment via surcharges to policyholders when future premiums are billed 
the terrorism act does not apply to the lines of insurance written by the company s life insurance subsidiaries

under a reinsurance arrangement  the company ceded of its risk under dental policies with effective dates prior to  ceded of its risk under dental policies with effective dates in through june  and cedes of its risk under dental policies with effective dates after june  see reinsurance 
the company s suite of voluntary group life  disability and accidental death and dismemberment insurance products are sold to employees on an elective basis at the worksite 
trends in the us employment market  particularly the increasing cost of employer provided medical benefits  are leading an increasing number of employers to offer new or additional benefits on a voluntary basis 
the company s suite of voluntary products allows the employees of the company s clients to choose  within specified parameters  the type and amount of insurance coverage  the premiums for which are collected through payroll deductions 
the company also offers a group limited benefit health insurance product which provides employee paid coverage for hourly  part time or other employees with seasonal or other irregular work schedules who would generally not be eligible for other employer provided health insurance plans 
because these products are convenient to purchase and maintain  the company believes that they are appealing to employees who might have little opportunity or inclination to purchase similar coverage on an individual basis 
the company believes that these products complement the company s core group employee benefit products and represent a significant growth opportunity 
non core group employee benefit products include certain products that have been discontinued  such as reinsurance facilities and excess casualty insurance  newer products which have not demonstrated their financial potential  products which are not expected to comprise a significant percentage of earned premiums and products for which sales are episodic in nature  such as lpts 
pursuant to an lpt  the company  in exchange for a specified one time premium payment to the company  assumes responsibility for making ongoing payments with respect to an existing block of disability or self insured workers compensation claims that are in the course of being paid over time 
these products are typically marketed to the same types of clients who have historically purchased the company s disability and excess workers compensation products 
non core group employee benefit products also include primary workers compensation insurance products  for which the company primarily receives fee income since a significant portion of the risks relating to these products is ceded by the company to third parties through indemnity reinsurance 
excess casualty insurance consists of a discontinued excess umbrella liability program 
this program entails exposure to excess of loss liability claims from past years  including environmental and asbestos related claims 
net incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to this program totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  non core group employee benefit products include bail bond insurance and workers compensation assumed reinsurance

asset accumulation products the company s asset accumulation products consist mainly of fixed annuities  primarily single premium deferred annuities spdas and flexible premium annuities fpas 
an spda provides for a single payment by an annuity holder to the company and the crediting of interest by the company on the annuity contract at the applicable crediting rate 
an fpa provides for periodic payments by an annuity holder to the company  the timing and amount of which are at the discretion of the annuity holder  and the crediting of interest by the company on the annuity contract at the applicable crediting rate 
interest credited on spdas and fpas is not paid currently to the annuity holder but instead accumulates and is added to the annuity contract s account value 
this accumulation is tax deferred 
the crediting rate may be increased or decreased by the company subject to specified guaranteed minimum crediting rates  which currently range from to 
for most of the company s fixed annuity products  the crediting rate may be reset by the company annually  typically on the policy anniversary 
the company s fixed annuity products also include multi year interest guarantee products  in which the crediting rate is fixed at a stated rate for a specified period of years  such periods ranging from three to eight years 
at december   the weighted average crediting rate on the company s fixed annuity products as a group was  which includes the effects of the first year crediting rate bonus on certain newly issued products 
withdrawals may be made by the annuity holder at any time  but withdrawals during the applicable surrender charge period will result in the assessment of surrender charges  and withdrawals may also result in taxes and or tax penalties to the holder on the withdrawn amount 
in addition  for annuity products containing a market value adjustment mva provision  the accumulated value of the annuity may be increased or decreased under such provision if it is surrendered during the surrender charge period 
under this provision  the accumulated value is guaranteed to be at least equal to the annuity premium paid  plus credited interest at the specified minimum guaranteed crediting rate 
the company does not market variable annuity products 
these fixed annuity products are sold predominantly to individuals through networks of independent agents 
in  the company s spda products accounted for million of asset accumulation product deposits  of which million was attributable to the mva annuity product  and million was attributable to fpa products  of which million had an mva feature 
two networks of independent agents accounted for approximately of the deposits from these spda and fpa products during  with no other network of independent agents accounting for more than of these deposits 
the company believes that it has a good relationship with these networks 
during the first quarter of  the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of fixed and floating rate funding agreements with maturities of three to five years in connection with the issuance by an unconsolidated special purpose vehicle of funding agreement backed notes in a corresponding principal amount 
the company believes that the funding agreement program enhances the company s asset accumulation business by providing an alternative source of distribution for this business 
the company s liability for the funding agreements is recorded in policyholder account balances 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected financial data concerning the company s asset accumulation products caption year ended december  dollars in thousands 
del asset accumulation product deposits sales fixed annuities    funding agreements  funds under management at period end    del 
at december   funds under management consisted of million of spda liabilities  million of fpa liabilities and million of funding agreements 
of the spda and fpa liabilities  million were subject to surrender charges averaging at december   with the balance of these liabilities not subject to surrender charges having been in force  on average  for years 
the company s funding agreements cannot be redeemed prior to maturity 
the company prices its annuity products based on assumptions concerning prevailing and expected interest rates and other factors that it believes will permit it to achieve a positive spread between its expected return on investments and the crediting rate 
the company attempts to achieve this spread by active portfolio management focusing on matching invested assets and related liabilities to minimize the exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates and by the adjustment of the crediting rate on its fixed annuity products 
in response to changes in interest rates  the company increases or decreases the crediting rates on its fixed annuity products 
in light of the annuity holder s ability to withdraw funds and the volatility of market interest rates  it is difficult to predict the timing of the company s payment obligations under its spdas and fpas 
consequently  the company maintains a portfolio of investments which are readily marketable and expected to be sufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements 
see investments 
other products and services the company provides integrated disability and absence management services on a nationwide basis through matrix  which was acquired in the company s comprehensive disability and absence management services are designed to assist clients in identifying and minimizing lost productivity and benefit payment costs resulting from employee absence due to illness  injury or personal leave

these services goal is to enhance employee productivity and provide more efficient benefit delivery and enhanced cost containment 
the company provides these services on an unbundled basis or in a unique integrated employee benefit program that combines these services with various group employee benefit insurance coverages 
the company believes that these integrated disability and absence management services complement the company s core group employee benefit products  enhancing the company s ability to market these core products and providing the company with a competitive advantage in the market for these products 
in  the company introduced a variable flexible premium universal life insurance policy under which the related assets are segregated in a separate account not subject to claims of general creditors of the company 
policyholders may elect to deposit amounts in the account from time to time  subject to underwriting limits and a minimum initial deposit of million 
both the cash values and death benefits of these policies fluctuate according to the investment experience of the assets in the separate account  accordingly  the investment risk with respect to these assets is borne by the policyholders 
the company earns fee income from the separate account in the form of charges for management and other administrative fees 
the company is not presently actively marketing this product 
the company reinsures risks in excess of  per individual under indemnity reinsurance arrangements with various reinsurance companies 
see reinsurance 
underwriting procedures premiums charged on insurance products are based in part on assumptions about the incidence  severity and timing of insurance claims 
the company has adopted and follows detailed underwriting procedures designed to assess and qualify insurance risks before issuing its policies 
to implement these procedures  the company employs a professional underwriting staff 
in underwriting group coverage  the company focuses on the overall risk characteristics of the group to be insured and the geographic concentration of its new and renewal business 
a prospective group client is evaluated with particular attention paid to the claims experience of the group with prior carriers  if any  the occupations of the insureds  the nature of the business of the client  the current economic outlook of the client in relation to others in its industry and of the industry as a whole  the appropriateness of the benefits or sir applied for and income from other sources during disability 
the company s products generally afford it the flexibility to seek  on an annual basis  following any initial premium rate guarantee period  to adjust premiums charged to its policyholders in order to reflect emerging mortality or morbidity experience 
investments the company s management of its investment portfolio is an important component of its profitability since a substantial portion of its operating income is generated from the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and  in the case of asset accumulation products  the interest credited on policyholder funds and  in the case of the company s other products for which reserves are discounted  the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
the company s overall investment strategy to achieve its objectives of safety and liquidity  while seeking the best available return  focuses on  among other things  matching of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities and seeking to minimize the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates

reinsurance the company participates in various reinsurance arrangements both in ceding insurance risks to third parties and in assuming insurance risks from third parties 
arrangements in which the company is the ceding insurer afford various levels of protection against loss by assisting the company in diversifying its risks and by limiting its maximum loss on risks that exceed retention limits 
under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which the company is the ceding insurer  the company remains liable for policy claims whether or not the assuming company meets its obligations to the company 
in an effort to manage this risk  the company monitors the financial position of its reinsurers  including  among other things  the companies financial ratings  and in certain cases receives collateral security from the reinsurer 
also  certain of the company s reinsurance agreements require the reinsurer to set up security arrangements for the company s benefit in the event of certain ratings downgrades 
in addition  the us federal government presently provides certain protections for insurers who issue certain property and casualty insurance coverages  including sncc 
see group employee benefit products 
the company cedes portions of the risks relating to its group employee benefit and variable life insurance products under indemnity reinsurance agreements with various unaffiliated reinsurers 
the terms of these agreements  which management believes are typical for agreements of this type  provide  among other things  for the automatic acceptance by the reinsurer of ceded risks in excess of the company s retention limits stated in the agreements 
the company pays reinsurance premiums to these reinsurers which are  in general  based upon percentages of premiums received by the company on the business reinsured less  in certain cases  ceding commissions and experience refunds paid by the reinsurer to the company 
these agreements are generally terminable as to new risks by either the company or the reinsurer on appropriate notice  however  termination does not affect risks ceded during the term of the agreement  for which the reinsurer generally remains liable

in these arrangements  the company provides coverage for losses in excess of specified amounts  subject to specified maximums 
coverage for losses as a result of terrorism is generally excluded from these reinsurance treaties 
the loss amounts at which the company s payment obligations attach under these arrangements range from  to billion  with an average attachment point of million 
aggregate exposures assumed under individual workers compensation reinsurance treaties generally range from  to million  with the average net exposure pursuant to any such treaty equal to million 
the company underwrites workers compensation reinsurance assumed pursuant to procedures similar to those utilized in connection with its excess workers compensation products 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to exit its non core property catastrophe reinsurance business  due to the volatility associated with such business and other strategic considerations  and has not thereafter entered into or renewed any assumed property reinsurance contracts 
all of the remaining reinsurance contracts expired prior to the end of the third quarter of  however  the company remains liable for certain risks assumed under such contracts prior to their expiration 
the company has classified the operating results of this business as discontinued operations 
see other transactions and note r to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into an indemnity reinsurance arrangement under which it assumed certain newly issued group disability insurance policies on an ongoing basis 
under this arrangement  the company was responsible for underwriting and claims management with respect to the reinsured business 
the company provided coverage primarily on a quota share basis up to a maximum company share of  in benefits per individual per month 
in april  rslic purchased substantially all of the assets of a third party administrator which had previously been administering business for rslic and contributed them to a newly established division of rslic  cds 
in addition  rslic hired approximately former employees of the third party administrator in connection with the asset acquisition 
cds  the operations of which are based in south portland  maine  is focused on expanding the company s presence in the turnkey group disability reinsurance market while also continuing to service existing clients from the indemnity reinsurance arrangement 
turnkey group disability reinsurance is typically provided to other insurance companies that would not otherwise have the capability of providing to their clients a group disability insurance product to complement their other product offerings 
under these reinsurance arrangements  rslic typically assumes through reinsurance  on a quota share basis  a substantial majority in proportionate amount of the risk associated with the group disability insurance policies issued by such other insurers 
cds provides pricing  underwriting and claims management services relating to such policies  utilizing the same policies and procedures as are applied with respect to rslic s directly written group disability insurance policies 
premium income and fees from the company s turnkey disability business and the arrangement was million  million and in  and  respectively  and incurred losses were million  million and in  and  respectively 
the company had in the past participated as an assuming insurer in a number of reinsurance facilities 
these reinsurance facilities generally are administered by tpas or managing underwriters who underwrite risks  coordinate premiums charged and process claims 
during and  the company terminated  on a prospective basis  its participations in all of these reinsurance facilities 
however  the terms of such facilities provide for the continued assumption of risks by  and payments of premiums to  facility participants with respect to business written in the periods during which they participated in such facilities 
premiums from all reinsurance facilities was  million and million in  and  respectively  and incurred losses from these facilities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
life  annuity  disability and accident reserves the company carries as liabilities actuarially determined reserves for its life  annuity  disability and accident policy and contract obligations 
these reserves  together with premiums to be received on policies in force and interest thereon at certain assumed rates  are calculated and established at levels believed to be sufficient to satisfy policy and contract obligations 
the company performs periodic studies to compare current experience for mortality  morbidity  interest and lapse rates with the anticipated experience reflected in the reserve assumptions to determine future policy benefit reserves for these products 
reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses are estimated based on individual loss data  historical loss data and industry averages and indices and include amounts determined on the basis of individual and actuarially determined estimates of future losses 
therefore  the company s ultimate liability for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses could deviate from the amounts of the reserves currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements  and such deviation could be significant 
under united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company s policy and claim reserves are permitted to be discounted to reflect the time value of money  since the payments to which such reserves relate will be made in future periods 
such reserve discounting  which is common industry practice  is based on interest rate assumptions reflecting projected portfolio yield rates for the assets supporting the liabilities 
see critical accounting policies and estimates future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note a to the consolidated financial statements for certain additional information regarding assumptions made by the company in connection with the establishment of its insurance reserves 
the assets selected to support the company s insurance liabilities produce cash flows that are intended to match the timing and amount of anticipated claim and claim expense payments 
differences between actual and expected claims experience are reflected currently in earnings for each period 
the life  annuity  disability and accident reserves carried in the consolidated financial statements are calculated based on gaap and differ from those reported by the company for statutory financial statement purposes 
these differences arise primarily from the use of different mortality and morbidity tables and interest assumptions 
property and casualty insurance reserves the company carries as liabilities actuarially determined reserves for anticipated claims and claim expenses for its excess workers compensation insurance and other casualty and property insurance products 
reserves for claim expenses represent the estimated costs of investigating those claims and  when necessary  defending lawsuits in connection with those claims 
reserves for claims and claim expenses are estimated based on individual loss data in the case of reported claims  historical loss data and industry averages and indices and include amounts determined on the basis of individual and actuarially determined estimates of future losses 
therefore  the company s ultimate liability could deviate from the amounts of the reserves currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements  and such deviation could be significant 
reserving practices under gaap allow discounting of claim reserves related to excess workers compensation losses to reflect the time value of money 
reserve discounting for these types of claims is common industry practice  and the discount factors used are less than the annual tax equivalent investment yield earned by the company on its invested assets 
the discount factors utilized by the company are based on the expected duration and payment pattern of the claims at the time the claims are settled and the risk free rate of return for us government securities with a comparable duration 
the company does not discount its reserves for claim expenses

these additional provisions did not result from specific changes in the company s key assumptions used to estimate the reserves since the preceding period end 
rather  in each year  they resulted from the company s application of the same estimating processes it has historically utilized to emerging experience data  including premium  loss and expense information  and the impact of these factors on inception to date experience 
in each period  the company makes its best estimate of reserves based on all of the information available to it at that time  which necessarily takes into account new experience emerging during the period

competition the financial services industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with numerous other insurance and financial services companies both in connection with sales of insurance and asset accumulation products and integrated disability and absence management services and in acquiring blocks of business and companies 
many of these organizations have substantially greater asset bases  higher ratings from ratings agencies  larger and more diversified portfolios of insurance products and larger sales operations 
competition in asset accumulation product markets is also encountered from banks  securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries marketing alternative savings products  such as mutual funds  traditional bank investment products and retirement funding alternatives 
the company believes that its reputation in the marketplace  quality of service  unique programs which integrate employee benefit products and absence management services and investment returns have enabled it to compete effectively for new business in its targeted markets 
the company reacts to changes in the marketplace generally by focusing on products believed to provide adequate margins and attempting to avoid those with low margins 
the company believes that its smaller size  relative to some of its competitors  enables it to more easily tailor its products to the demands of customers 
regulation the company s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by state insurance authorities in the states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they conduct business 
these regulations  among other things  limit the amount of dividends and other payments that can be made by the company s insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments these subsidiaries may have 
these regulations also affect many other aspects of the company s insurance subsidiaries business  including  for example  risk based capital rbc requirements  various reserve requirements  the terms  conditions and manner of sale and marketing of insurance products  claims handling practices and the form and content of required financial statements 
these regulations are intended to protect policyholders rather than investors 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are required under these regulations to file detailed annual financial reports with the supervisory agencies in the various states in which they do business  and their business and accounts are subject to examination at any time by these agencies 
to date  no examinations have produced any significant adverse findings or adjustments 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to continue to conduct their businesses is dependent upon the maintenance of their licenses in these various states 
in april  the new york state attorney general nyag initiated an investigation into certain insurance broker compensation arrangements and other aspects of dealings between insurance brokers and insurance companies  and  in connection therewith  filed a civil complaint in october against a major insurance brokerage firm  marsh mclennan  based on certain of such firm s compensation arrangements with insurers and alleged misconduct in connection with the placement of insurance business 
other state regulators subsequently announced the commencement of similar investigations and reviews 
the company received administrative subpoenas or similar requests for information from the illinois division of insurance  the missouri department of insurance  the nyag s office  the north carolina department of insurance and the ohio department of insurance in connection with their investigations 
additional regulatory inquiries may be received by its insurance subsidiaries as the various investigations continue 
the company has fully cooperated with inquiries it has received to date  and it intends to fully cooperate with any future inquiries of this type 
based on an internal review in relating to the company s insurance subsidiaries  the company had identified certain potential issues concerning past insurance solicitation practices involving sncc and marsh mclennan 
the instances that the company was able to specifically identify in this regard were limited in number and involved modest amounts of premium 
the company reported on these issues to the nyag s office and to the missouri department of insurance in in  sncc was the subject of a targeted market conduct examination by the missouri department of insurance relating to these issues  which did not result in any significant adverse findings 
the company will fully cooperate with these and any other regulatory agencies relating to these issues 
it is not possible to predict the future impact of this matter on the company or of the various investigations  or any regulatory changes or litigation resulting from such investigations  on the insurance industry or on the company and its insurance subsidiaries 
from time to time  increased scrutiny has been placed upon the insurance regulatory framework  and a number of state legislatures have considered or enacted legislative measures that alter  and in many cases increase  state authority to regulate insurance companies 
in addition to legislative initiatives of this type  the national association of insurance commissioners the naic and insurance regulators are continuously involved in a process of reexamining existing laws and regulations and their application to insurance companies 
furthermore  while the federal government currently does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal legislation and administrative policies in a number of areas  such as employee benefits regulation  age  sex and disability based discrimination  financial services regulation and federal taxation  can significantly affect the insurance business 
it is not possible to predict the future impact of changing regulation on the operations of the company and its insurance subsidiaries 
the naic s rbc requirements for insurance companies take into account asset risks  insurance risks  interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to the insurer s business and specify varying degrees of regulatory action to occur to the extent that an insurer does not meet the specified rbc thresholds  with increasing degrees of regulatory scrutiny or intervention provided for companies in categories of lesser rbc compliance 
the company believes that its insurance subsidiaries are adequately capitalized under the rbc requirements and that the thresholds will not have any significant regulatory effect on the company 
however  were the insurance subsidiaries rbc position to materially decline in the future  the insurance subsidiaries continued ability to pay dividends and the degree of regulatory supervision or control to which they are subjected may be affected 
the company s insurance subsidiaries can also be required  under solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business  to pay assessments to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insurance companies that become insolvent 
these assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most solvency or guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s financial strength and  in most instances  may be offset against future state premium taxes 
sncc did not recognize any expense in or and recognized million in for these types of assessments 
none of the company s life insurance subsidiaries has ever incurred any significant costs of this nature 
employees the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately  persons at december  the company believes that it enjoys good relations with its employees 
other subsidiaries the company conducts certain of its investment management activities through its wholly owned subsidiary  delphi capital management  inc dcm  and makes certain investments through other wholly owned non insurance subsidiaries

item a 
risk factors 
reserves established for future policy benefits and claims may prove inadequate 
the company s reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses are estimates that entail various assumptions and judgments 
see critical accounting policies and estimates future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a description of the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process 
these estimates are subject to variability  since the factors and events affecting the ultimate liability for claims have not all taken place  and thus cannot be evaluated with certainty 
moreover  under the company s actuarial methodologies  these estimates are subject to reevaluation based on developing trends with respect to the company s loss experience 
such trends may emerge over longer periods of time  and changes in such trends cannot necessarily be identified or predicted at any given time by reference to current claims experience  whether favorable or unfavorable 
if the company s actual loss experience from its current or discontinued products is less favorable than the company s assumptions or estimates  the company s reserves could be inadequate 
in such event  the company s results of operations  in addition to its liquidity and financial condition  could be materially adversely affected 
the market values of the company s investments fluctuate 
the market values of the company s investments vary depending on economic and market conditions  including interest rates  and such values can decline as a result of changes in such conditions 
increasing interest rates or a widening in the spread between interest rates available on us treasury securities and corporate debt  for example  will typically have an adverse impact on the market values of the fixed maturity securities in the company s investment portfolio 
if interest rates decline  the company generally achieves a lower overall rate of return on investments of cash generated from the company s operations 
in addition  in the event that investments are called or mature in a declining interest rate environment  the company may be unable to reinvest the proceeds in securities with comparable interest rates 
the company may also in the future be required or determine to sell certain investments  whether to meet contractual obligations to its policyholders  or otherwise  at a price and a time when the market value of such investments is less than the book value of such investments  resulting in losses to the company 
declines in the fair value of investments that are considered in the judgment of management to be other than temporary are reported as realized investment losses 
see critical accounting policies and estimates investments 
in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a description of management s evaluation process 
the company has experienced and may in the future experience losses from other than temporary declines in security values 
such losses are recorded as realized investment losses in the income statement 
see results of operations compared to in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company invests in certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in various financial instruments 
these investments are reflected in the company s financial statements under the equity method  accordingly  positive or negative changes in the value of the investees financial instruments are included in net investment income 
thus  the company s results of operations  in addition to its liquidity and financial condition  could be materially adversely affected if these entities were to experience significant losses in the values of their financial assets 
the company s investment strategy exposes the company to default and other risks 
the management of the company s investment portfolio is an important component of the company s profitability since a substantial portion of the company s operating income is generated from the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and  in the case of asset accumulation products  the interest credited on policyholder funds and  in the case of the company s other products for which reserves are discounted  the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
see liquidity and capital resources investments 
in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a description of the company s investment portfolio and strategy 
the company is subject to the risk  among others  that the issuers of the fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans the company owns will default on principal or interest payments 
a major economic downturn or any of the various other factors that affect issuers abilities to pay could result in issuer defaults 
because the company s investments consist primarily of fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans and short term investments  such defaults could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited  however  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
the company s financial position exposes the company to interest rate risks 
because the company s primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature  the company s consolidated financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company seeks to manage this risk through active portfolio management focusing on minimizing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by matching its invested assets and related liabilities and by periodically adjusting the crediting rates on its annuity products 
see liquidity and capital resources asset liability management and market risk 
in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the profitability of group employee benefit products for which the reserves are discounted is also affected by the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
the company manages this risk by seeking to adjust the prices charged for these products 
the company s ability to reduce its exposure to risks depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance 
the company transfers its exposure to some risks through reinsurance ceded arrangements with other insurance and reinsurance companies 
under the company s reinsurance ceded arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of the company s risks under certain of its insurance policies in exchange for a specified portion of the premiums received by the company under such policies 
at december  and  the company had reinsurance receivables of million and million  respectively 
the availability  amount  cost and terms of reinsurance may vary significantly based on market conditions 
any decrease in the amount of the company s reinsurance ceded will increase the company s risk of loss and premium income  and any increase in the cost of such reinsurance will  absent a decrease in the reinsurance amount  reduce the company s premium income 
furthermore  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to reinsurance 
the company s reinsurance ceded arrangements generally consist of indemnity reinsurance transactions in which the company is liable for the transferred risks whether or not the reinsurers meet their financial obligations to the company 
such failures could materially affect the company s results of operations  in addition to its liquidity and financial condition 
following the terrorist events of september   due to various factors  higher prices and less favorable terms and conditions have been offered in the reinsurance market 
these market conditions are reflected in the terms of the replacement reinsurance arrangements entered into during and remaining in effect for the company s excess workers compensation and long term disability products 
see liquidity and capital resources reinsurance 
in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the future  the company s reinsurers may continue to seek price increases or other unfavorable modifications to the terms  conditions or amounts of their reinsurance coverages  although the extent of any such actions cannot currently be predicted 
also  there has been significantly reduced availability of reinsurance covering risks such as terrorist and catastrophic events 
accordingly  substantially all of the company s coverages of this nature were discontinued during  which would result in the company bearing a higher portion of losses from such events if they occur 
the company has not been able to replace such coverages on acceptable terms due to present market conditions  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future 
however  under the terrorism act  which terminates on december   the federal government will pay of the company s covered losses during  relating to acts of international terrorism from property and casualty products directly written by sncc above the company s annual deductible 
see group employee benefit products in item business 
the occurrence of a significant terrorist or catastrophic event could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  in addition to its liquidity and financial condition 
the insurance business is a heavily regulated industry 
the company s insurance subsidiaries  like other insurance companies  are highly regulated by state insurance authorities in the states in which they are domiciled and the other states in which they conduct business 
such regulations  among other things  limit the amount of dividends and other payments that can be made by such subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments such subsidiaries may have 
these regulations also affect many other aspects of the company s insurance subsidiaries businesses  including  for example  rbc requirements  various reserve requirements  the terms  conditions and manner of sale and marketing of insurance products  claims handling practices and the form and content of required financial statements 
these regulations are intended to protect policyholders rather than investors 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to continue to conduct their businesses is dependent upon the maintenance of their licenses in these various states

it is not possible to predict the future impact of changing regulation on the operations of the company and those of its insurance subsidiaries 
the company s insurance subsidiaries can also be required  under solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business  to pay assessments to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insurance companies that become insolvent 
the company s financial position and results of operations may be adversely impacted by changes in accounting rules and in the interpretations of such rules 
the company s financial position and results of operations are reported in accordance with gaap  in the case of the company  and in accordance with statutory accounting principles  in the case of the statutory financial statements of its insurance subsidiaries 
changes in the applicable gaap or statutory accounting rules  or in the interpretations of such rules  may adversely affect the company s and such subsidiaries reported financial condition and results of operations 
in september  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts 
sop provides gaap accounting guidance for deferred policy acquisition costs associated with internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts not addressed by previous accounting guidance  including group insurance products 
it defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits  features  rights  or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract  or by amendment  endorsement or rider to a contract  or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract 
the provisions of sop are effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  the company is in the process of implementing the changes required by its adoption of sop and evaluating the impact the statement will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
based on the company s evaluation to date  the company preliminarily estimates that the after tax charge that will result from the cumulative adjustment to the company s beginning retained earnings balance at january  will be in the range of million to million  net of the related tax benefit 
this preliminary estimate is based on the company s interpretation of sop and the manner of its implementation with respect to deferred policy acquisition costs relating to the company s group employee benefit products 
however  these matters involve a significant degree of interpretive judgment  and the company s interpretation is subject to future change due to the issuance of further accounting guidance regarding sop or its application by the accounting industry 
it is therefore possible that such charge will be adjusted  either upward or downward  in the event of such a change and thus be outside the company s presently estimated range 
an upward adjustment could materially adversely affect the company s consolidated financial position  in addition  changes required by future accounting guidance regarding sop or its implementation could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the financial services industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with numerous other insurance and financial services companies 
many of these organizations have substantially greater assets  higher ratings from rating agencies  larger and more diversified portfolios of insurance products and larger agency sales operations than the company 
competition in asset accumulation product markets is also encountered from banks  securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries marketing alternative savings products  such as mutual funds  traditional bank investments and retirement funding alternatives 
the company may be adversely impacted by a decline in the ratings of its insurance subsidiaries or its own credit ratings 
ratings with respect to claims paying ability and financial strength have become an increasingly important factor impacting the competitive position of insurance companies 
the financial strength ratings of rslic as of february as assigned by am best  fitch  moody s and standard poor s were a excellent  a strong  a good and a strong  respectively 
the financial strength ratings of sncc as of february as assigned by am best  fitch and standard poor s were a excellent  a strong and a strong  respectively 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings of companies periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained or improved in the future 
claims paying and financial strength ratings are based upon factors relevant to the company s insurance subsidiary policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors in the company 
downgrades in the ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect sales of their products and policyholder withdrawals and could have a material adverse effect on the results of the company s operations 
in addition  downgrades in the company s credit ratings could materially adversely affect its ability to access the capital markets 
the company s senior unsecured debt ratings as of february from am best  fitch  moody s and standard poor s were bbb  bbb  baa and bbb  respectively 
the ratings for rslic s funding agreements as of february from am best  moody s and standard poor s were a  a  and a  respectively

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company  through its subsidiaries  underwrites a diverse portfolio of group employee benefit products  primarily group life  disability  and excess workers compensation insurance 
revenues from this group of products are primarily comprised of earned premiums and investment income 
the profitability of group employee benefit products is affected by  among other things  differences between actual and projected claims experience  the retention of existing customers  product mix and the company s ability to attract new customers  change premium rates and contract terms for existing customers and control administrative expenses 
the company transfers its exposure to a portion of its group employee benefit risks through reinsurance ceded arrangements with other insurance and reinsurance companies 
accordingly  the profitability of the company s group employee benefit products is affected by the amount  cost and terms of reinsurance it obtains 
the profitability of those group employee benefit products for which reserves are discounted is also affected by the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
the company is continuing to experience favorable market conditions for its excess workers compensation products due to high primary workers compensation rates 
for its other group employee benefit products  the company is continuing to increase the size of its sales force in order to enhance its focus on the small case niche insured groups of to individuals  including employers which are first time providers of these employee benefits  which the company believes to offer opportunities for superior profitability 
in the fourth quarter of  the company decided to exit its non core property catastrophe reinsurance business  due to the volatility associated with such business and other strategic considerations  and has not thereafter renewed or written any new reinsurance contracts in this business 
a substantial majority of these reinsurance contracts expired on or before december  and all of the remaining contracts expired during the third quarter of  however  the company remains liable for certain risks assumed under such contracts prior to their expiration 
the company reclassified the operating results of this business as discontinued operations 
see results of operations compared to loss from discontinued operations 
the company also operates an asset accumulation business that focuses primarily on offering fixed annuities to individuals 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of fixed and floating rate funding agreements with maturities of three to five years in connection with the issuance by an unconsolidated special purpose vehicle of funding agreement backed notes in a corresponding principal amount 
the company believes that the funding agreement program enhances the company s asset accumulation business by providing an alternative source of distribution for this business 
the company s liability for the funding agreements is recorded in policyholder account balances 
deposits from the company s asset accumulation business are recorded as liabilities rather than as premiums 
revenues from the company s asset accumulation business are primarily comprised of investment income earned on the funds under management 
the profitability of asset accumulation products is primarily dependent on the spread achieved between the return on investments and the interest credited to holders of these products 
the company sets the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products in an effort to achieve its targeted interest rate spreads on these products  and is willing to accept lower levels of sales on these products when market conditions make these targeted spreads more difficult to achieve 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management  in some instances  to make judgments about the application of these principles 
the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period could differ materially from the amounts reported if different conditions existed or different judgments were utilized 
a discussion of how management applies certain critical accounting policies and makes certain estimates is presented below in the critical accounting policies and estimates section and should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition of the company

in and  the company recognized after tax operating loss income of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively  net of income tax benefit expense of million and million  respectively  from this business 
see note r to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the company held approximately million of financial resources at the holding company level at december   primarily comprised of investments in the common stock of its investment subsidiaries  investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies and short term investments 
the assets of the investment subsidiaries are primarily invested in limited partnerships and limited liability companies 
a shelf registration statement is also in effect under which securities yielding proceeds of up to million may be issued by the company 
in october  the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  na as administrative agent  and a group of major banking institutions the amended credit agreement 
the amendment  among other things  increased the maximum borrowings available to million  improved the pricing terms and extended the maturity date from may to october at the company s request  the amount of the million facility may be increased to a maximum of million at any time during the five year term to the extent that additional lender funding commitments are obtained 
the amended credit agreement contains various financial and other affirmative and negative covenants  along with various representations and warranties  considered ordinary for this type of credit agreement 
the covenants include  among others  the maintenance by the company of a specified consolidated debt to capital ratio  a minimum consolidated net worth for the company  minimum statutory risk based capital requirements for rslic and sncc  and certain limitations on investments and subsidiary indebtedness 
at december   the company had million of borrowings available under the amended credit agreement 
other sources of liquidity at the holding company level include dividends paid from subsidiaries  primarily generated from operating cash flows and investments 
during  the company s insurance subsidiaries will be permitted  without prior regulatory approval  to make dividend payments totaling million 
the company s insurance subsidiaries may also pay additional dividends with the requisite regulatory approvals 
see regulation 
in part i  item business 
in general  dividends from the company s non insurance subsidiaries are not subject to regulatory or other restrictions 
the company s current liquidity needs  in addition to funding its operating expenses  include principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings under the amended credit agreement  interest payments on the senior notes  and distributions on the capital securities and the capital securities 
the senior notes mature in their entirety in may and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements but are redeemable by the company at par at any time on or after may  the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures underlying the capital securities are not redeemable prior to march  the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures underlying the capital securities are redeemable  in whole or in part  beginning may  see notes d and i to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
the senior notes and the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures underlying company obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiaries are assumed to be repaid on their respective maturity dates

other long term liabilities consist of future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses relating to the company s insurance products  as well as policyholder account balances 
substantially all of the amounts reflected in this table with respect to such liabilities consist of estimates by the company s management based on various actuarial and other assumptions relating to the company s insurance products and  as to policyholder account balances  the periods for which the related annuity and other contracts will remain in force and the crediting rates to be applied thereto in the future 
in accordance with gaap  a substantial portion of such liabilities  as they relate to the company s insurance products  are carried on a discounted basis on its consolidated balance sheet  however  the amounts contained in this table are presented on an undiscounted basis 
the actual payments relating to these liabilities will differ  both in amount and timing  from those indicated in this table and such differences are likely to be significant 
see critical accounting policies and estimates future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
primarily includes interest on the senior notes 
includes interest on the outstanding junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities and the junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities 
interest on the junior subordinated debentures was computed using the indexed rate in effect at december  of 
sources of liquidity available to the company on a parent company only basis  including the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries and additional borrowings available under the amended credit agreement  are expected to exceed the company s current and long term cash requirements 
the company from time to time engages in discussions with respect to acquiring blocks of business and insurance and financial services companies  any of which could  if consummated  be material to the company s operations 
the principal liquidity requirements of the company s insurance subsidiaries are their contractual obligations to policyholders and other financing sources 
the primary sources of funding for these obligations  in addition to operating earnings  are the marketable investments included in the investment portfolios of these subsidiaries 
the company actively manages its investment portfolio to match its invested assets and related liabilities 
the company regularly analyzes the results of its asset liability matching through cash flow analysis and duration matching under multiple interest rate scenarios 
see asset liability management and market risk 
therefore  the company believes that these sources of funding will be adequate for its insurance subsidiaries to satisfy on both a short term and long term basis these contractual obligations throughout their estimated or stated period 
however  if such contractual obligations were to arise more rapidly or in greater amounts than anticipated in the company s asset liability matching analysis  the company could be required to sell securities earlier than anticipated  potentially resulting in the realization of capital losses particularly  as regards fixed income securities  in a rising interest rate environment  or to borrow funds from available credit sources  in order to fund the payment of such obligations 
in any of such events  the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
cash flows 
operating activities increased cash by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net investing activities used million of cash during primarily for the purchase of securities  and financing activities provided million of cash  principally due to the issuance of funding agreements and an increase in the company s revolving credit borrowings  partially offset by repurchases of the company s class a common stock having a total cost of million 
share repurchase program 
the company s board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program 
share repurchases are effected by the company in the open market or in negotiated transactions in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of rule b under the securities exchange act of execution of the share repurchase program is based on management s assessment of market conditions for its common stock and other potential uses of capital 
during the first quarter of  the company repurchased  shares of its class a common stock at a total cost of million with a volume weighted average price of per share 
at december   the repurchase of approximately million shares remained authorized under this program 
investments 
the company s overall investment strategy emphasizes safety and liquidity  while seeking the best available return  by focusing on  among other things  managing the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities and seeking to minimize the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s investment portfolio  which totaled  million at december   consists primarily of investments in fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  investments in limited partnerships  trading account securities and short term investments 
during  the market value of the company s investment portfolio  in relation to its amortized cost  increased by million from year end  before related changes in the cost of business acquired of million and a decrease in the income tax provision of million 
in addition  the company recognized pre tax net investment losses of million in the weighted average credit rating of those of the company s fixed maturity securities having ratings by standard poor s corporation  was aa at december  while ratings of this type address credit risk  they do not address other risks  such as prepayment and extension risks  which are discussed below 
at december   approximately of the company s total invested assets were comprised of corporate fixed maturity securities 
eighty four percent of the company s corporate fixed maturity portfolio  based on fair values  has been rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities are distributed among the various rating categories as follows aaa  aa  a  and bbb 
corporate fixed maturity securities subject the company to credit risk and  to a lesser extent  interest rate risk 
to reduce its exposure to corporate credit risk  the company diversifies its investments across economic sectors  industry classes and issuers 
mortgage backed securities comprised of the company s total invested assets at december  ninety seven percent of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio  based on fair values  has been rated as investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
mortgage backed securities subject the company to a degree of interest rate risk  including prepayment and extension risk  which is generally a function of the sensitivity of each security s underlying collateral to prepayments under varying interest rate environments and the repayment priority of the securities in the particular securitization structure 
the company seeks to limit the extent of this risk by emphasizing the more predictable payment classes and securities with stable collateral 
the company  through its insurance subsidiaries  maintains a program in which investments are financed using advances from various federal home loan banks 
the company has utilized this program to manage the duration of its liabilities and to earn spread income  which is the difference between the financing cost and the earnings from the investments purchased with those funds 
at december   the company had an outstanding advance of million 
the advance was obtained at a fixed rate and has a term to maturity of years 
in addition  the company has from time to time utilized reverse repurchase agreements  futures and option contracts and interest rate and credit default swaps in connection with its investment strategy 
these transactions may require the company to maintain securities or cash on deposit with the applicable counterparty as collateral 
as the market value of the collateral or contracts changes  the company may be required to deposit additional collateral or be entitled to have a portion of the collateral returned to it 
the company also maintains a securities lending program under which  from time to time  certain securities from its portfolio are loaned to other institutions for short periods of time 
the company maintains full ownership rights to the securities loaned and continues to earn interest and dividends on them 
the collateral received for securities loaned is recorded at the fair value of the collateral  which is generally in an amount in excess of the market value of the securities loaned 
the company s institutional lending agent monitors the market value of the securities loaned and obtains additional collateral as necessary 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
the types and amounts of investments made by the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile 
each of these states has comprehensive investment regulations 
in addition  the company s amended credit agreement also contains limitations  with which the company is currently in compliance in all material respects  on the composition of the company s investment portfolio 
the company also continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited 
asset liability management and market risk 
because the company s primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature  the company s consolidated financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by active portfolio management focusing on minimizing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by matching its invested assets and related liabilities and by periodically adjusting the crediting rates on its annuity products and the discount rate used to calculate reserves on the company s other products 
in its asset liability matching process  the company determines and monitors on a quarterly basis the duration of its insurance liabilities in the aggregate and the duration of the investment portfolio supporting such liabilities in order to ensure that the difference between such durations  or the duration gap  remains below an internally specified maximum  and similarly determines and monitors the duration gap as between its interest sensitive liabilities  substantially all of which relate to its asset accumulation products  and the components of its investment portfolio supporting such liabilities in relation to a separate internally specified maximum 
as of december   the company maintained these duration gaps within the aforementioned maximums 
in addition  the company  at times  has utilized futures and option contracts and interest rate or credit default swap agreements primarily to reduce the risk associated with changes in the value of its fixed maturity portfolio 
at december   the company had no material outstanding futures or option contracts or interest rate or credit default swap agreements 
the company  at times  may also invest in foreign currency denominated fixed maturity securities that expose it to fluctuations in foreign currency rates  and therefore  may hedge such exposure by using currency forward contracts 
the company s investment in foreign currency denominated fixed maturity securities during was less than of total invested assets 
the company regularly analyzes the results of its asset liability matching through cash flow analysis and duration matching under multiple interest rate scenarios 
these analyses assist the company in estimating the potential gain or loss in fair value of its interest rate sensitive financial instruments due to hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on these analyses  if interest rates were to immediately increase by from their year end levels  the fair value of the company s interest sensitive assets  net of corresponding changes in the fair value of cost of business acquired and insurance and investment related liabilities  would decline by approximately million at december  as compared to a decline of approximately million at december  these analyses incorporate numerous assumptions and estimates and assume no changes in the composition of the company s investment portfolio in reaction to such interest rate changes 
consequently  the results indicated by these analyses will likely be materially different from the actual changes in the value of the company s assets that will be experienced under given interest rate scenarios 
the company manages the composition of its borrowed capital by considering factors such as the ratio of borrowed capital to total capital  future borrowing requirements  the interest rate environment and other market conditions 
at december   a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates would cause a corresponding million increase in the fair value of the company s fixed rate corporate debt which matures in as compared to an increase of million at december  because interest expense on the company s floating rate corporate debt that was outstanding at december  would have fluctuated as prevailing interest rates changed  changes in market interest rates would not have materially affected its fair value 
reinsurance 
the company cedes portions of the risks relating to its group employee benefit products under indemnity reinsurance agreements with various unaffiliated reinsurers 
the company pays reinsurance premiums generally based upon percentages of the company s premiums on the business reinsured 
these agreements expire at various intervals as to new risks  and replacement agreements are negotiated on terms believed appropriate in light of then current market conditions 
during  the company entered into a reinsurance arrangement under which the company cedes of its excess workers compensation risks between million and million  per occurrence 
during  the company entered into a reinsurance arrangement under which the company cedes a substantial majority in proportionate amount of the risks between million and million  per occurrence 
these changes have increased the reinsurance premiums paid by the company for these products 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company s management  in some instances  to make judgments about the application of these principles 
the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period could differ materially from the amounts reported if different conditions existed or different judgments were utilized 
management s judgment is most critical in the estimation of its liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses and its assets for cost of business acquired and in the valuation of its investments 
a discussion of how management applies these critical accounting policies follows 
future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the company establishes reserves that are intended to be sufficient to fund the future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses relating to its insurance products 
these reserves  which totaled  million at december   represent management s best estimate of future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the reserves are calculated using various generally recognized actuarial methodologies and are based upon assumptions and estimates that management believes are appropriate and which vary by type of product 
annually  external actuarial experts also review the company s methodologies  assumptions and the resulting reserves 
the company s projected ultimate insurance liabilities and associated reserves are estimates  which are subject to variability 
this variability arises because the factors and events affecting the ultimate liability for claims have not all taken place  and thus cannot be evaluated with certainty 
as a result  actual future ultimate losses will not develop exactly as projected and may vary significantly from the projections 
the estimation process is complex and involves information obtained from company specific and industry wide data  as well as general economic information 
the company s insurance reserves are based upon management s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data 
as additional experience emerges and other data become available  these estimates and judgments are reviewed and may be revised 
the methods and assumptions used to establish the company s insurance reserves are continually reviewed and updated based on current circumstances  and any resulting adjustments may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in the company s results of operations for the periods in which such revisions are made 
there were no material changes in the current year in the actuarial methods and or assumptions from those used in the previous periods  however  in  and  the company experienced degrees of adverse variance in loss experience from its past projections 
see property and casualty insurance reserves 
in part i  item business 
the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses for the company s disability and accident products relate to mortality  morbidity  claim termination and discount rates 
mortality and morbidity assumptions are based on various actuarial tables that are generally utilized in the industry  modified as believed to be necessary for possible variations 
the claim termination rate represents the probability that a disability claim will close or change due to maximum benefits being paid under the policy  the recovery or death of the claimant  or a change in status in any given period 
establishing claim termination rates is complex and involves many factors  including the cause of disability  the claimant s age and the type of contractual benefits provided 
the company uses its extensive claim experience database to develop its claim termination rate assumptions  which are applied as an average to its large population of active claims 
a one percent increase or decrease in the group long term disability claim termination rate established by the company  which the company believes is a reasonable range of variance in this regard  would have decreased or increased  respectively  the reserves established for claims incurred in by approximately million  which would in turn have increased or decreased  respectively  its net income by million 
disability reserves are discounted using interest rate assumptions based upon projected portfolio yield rates for the assets supporting the liabilities 
the company s discount rate assumptions are discussed in further detail below 
the company s reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are determined on an individual basis for reported claims  for which case reserves are established  and estimates of incurred but not reported ibnr losses are developed on the basis of past experience 
the unpaid claims and claim expense reserves carried for the company s casualty insurance products represent the difference between the selected ultimate loss amount and the loss amount paid to date 
the unpaid claims and claim expense reserves carried for the company s disability and accident insurance products are established by the incurred loss development method as described below utilizing various mathematic tools in order to project future loss experience based on the company s historical loss experience 
the difference between total unpaid claims and claim expense reserves and case unpaid claims and claim expense reserves represent the ibnr reserve 
the following table summarizes the composition of the company s total reserves for disability  accident and property and casualty claims and claim expenses  split between case and ibnr reserves  as of december  dollars in millions 
del balance  net of reinsurance case reserves disability and accident property and casualty ibnr reserves disability and accident property and casualty total reserves  reinsurance receivables balance  gross of reinsurance  balance sheets future policy benefits disability and accident unpaid claims and claim expenses disability and accident property and casualty  del 
the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for unpaid claims and claim expenses for the company s property and casualty insurance products are the trend in loss costs  the expected frequency and severity of claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
other assumptions include that the coverages under these insurance products will not be expanded by future legislative action or judicial interpretation and that extraordinary classes of losses not previously in existence will not arise in the future 
the assumptions vary based on the year the claim is incurred 
at december   disability and primary and excess workers compensation reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses with a carrying value of  million have been discounted at a weighted average rate of  with the rates ranging from to 
disability reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are discounted using interest rate assumptions based upon projected portfolio yield rates for the assets supporting the liabilities 
the assets selected to support these liabilities produce cash flows that are intended to match the timing and amount of anticipated claim and claim expense payments 
primary and excess workers compensation claim reserves are discounted using interest rate assumptions based on the risk free rate of return for us government securities with a duration comparable to the expected duration and payment pattern of the claims at the time the claims are settled 
the rates used to discount reserves are determined annually 
the level of the rate utilized to discount reserves in a particular period directly impacts the level of the reserves established for such period 
for example  a basis point increase in the discount rates the company applied to disability and primary and excess workers compensation claims incurred in would have decreased the amount of the reserves it established with respect to such claims by approximately million  and a basis point decrease in such rates would have increased the amount of such reserves by the same amount 
in both cases  discount rate changes of this type and magnitude would be intended to reasonably reflect corresponding changes in market interest rates 
these levels of change to the company s discount rate would have increased  in the first case  or decreased  in the second  its net income by million 
the primary actuarial methods used to establish the company s reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses for its property and casualty insurance products are the incurred loss development method and the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss method 
under the incurred loss development method  various mathematic tools are utilized in order to project future loss experience based on the company s historical loss experience 
this method is utilized for accident years as to which management believes a sufficient level of historical loss experience exists 
for more recent years for which this level of experience does not exist  management utilizes the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss method to establish loss reserves 
under this method  in addition to historical loss experience  the company also takes into account an expected loss ratio based on information determined during the initial pricing of the business  including  among other factors  rate increases and changes in terms and conditions 
the company s actuaries select an ultimate loss reserve amount for its property and casualty insurance products by reviewing the results of the actuarial methods described above  as well as other tertiary methods which serve to provide supplemental data points  and applying judgments to achieve a point estimate for the ultimate loss amount  rather than calculating ranges around the reserves 
reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses for such products represent management s best estimate and are based upon this actuarially derived point estimate 
in reviewing and determining the adequacy of this estimate  management considers several factors such as historical results  changes to policy pricing  terms and conditions  deductibles  sir levels and attachment points  claims handling staffing  practices and procedures  effects of claim inflation  industry loss trends  reinsurance coverages  underwriting initiatives  and changes in state legislative and regulatory environments 
for the company s property and casualty insurance products  a review of the eight most recent years historical loss development variation reflects an annual range of to 
the average annual increase reflected in such review was and the average decrease was 
if the company were to assume subsequent loss development of or  each of which are within historical variation  the estimated unpaid claims and claims expense reserves  net of reinsurance  established for such products as of december  would be increased by million in the first case  which would have decreased its net income by million  or decreased by million in the second  which would have increased its net income by million 
management believes that while fluctuations of this magnitude could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  they would not be likely to materially affect its financial condition or liquidity 
however  it is possible that  using other assumptions or variables that are outside of the range of historical variation  the level of the company s unpaid claims and claim expenses could be changed by an amount that could be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
for the reasons described above  if the company s actual loss experience from its current or discontinued products is less favorable than the company s assumptions or estimates  the company s reserves could be inadequate 
in such event  the company s results of operations  in addition to its liquidity and financial condition  could be materially adversely affected 
deferred acquisition costs 
costs related to the acquisition of new insurance business  such as commissions  certain costs associated with policy issuance and underwriting  and certain sales support expenses  are deferred when incurred 
the unamortized balance of these deferred acquisition costs is included in cost of business acquired on the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred acquisition costs related to group life  disability and accident products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the anticipated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present value of the total expected premium income 
deferred acquisition costs related to casualty insurance products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the period in which the related premium is earned 
deferred acquisition costs related to annuity products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the anticipated lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from such policies anticipated surrender charges and mortality  investment and expense margins 
the amortization is a constant percentage of estimated gross profits based on the ratio of the present value of amounts deferred as compared to the present value of estimated gross profits 
adjustments are made each year to reflect the actual gross profits to date as compared to assumed experience and any changes in the remaining expected future gross profits 
the unamortized balance of deferred policy acquisition costs related to certain asset accumulation products is adjusted for the impact on estimated future gross profits as if net unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities had been realized at the balance sheet date 
the impact of this adjustment  net of the related income tax expense or benefit  is included in net unrealized appreciation and depreciation as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
deferred acquisition costs are charged to current earnings to the extent that it is determined that future premiums or estimated gross profits will not be adequate to cover the amounts deferred 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts represented  and of the total amounts of the deferred acquisition cost balances outstanding at the beginning of the respective periods 
effective january   the company adopted the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts 
which impacted  and will in the future impact  the way the company accounts for deferred acquisition costs 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
investments 
investments are primarily carried at fair value with unrealized appreciation and depreciation included as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity  net of the related income tax benefit or expense and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired 
ninety seven percent of the company s fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio are actively traded in a liquid market or have other liquidity mechanisms 
investments acquired through private placements  which are not actively traded in a liquid market and do not have other mechanisms for their liquidation  totaled million at december  the company estimates the fair value for these securities primarily by comparison to similar securities with quoted market prices 
if quotes are not available on similar securities  the company estimates fair value based on recent purchases or sales of similar securities or other internally prepared valuations 
key assumptions used in this process include the level of risk free interest rates  risk premiums  and performance of underlying collateral  if applicable 
all such investments are classified as available for sale 
the company s ability to liquidate these investments in a timely manner  if necessary  may be limited by the lack of an actively traded market 
historically  the company has not realized amounts on dispositions of non marketable investments that varied materially from the amounts estimated by the company under this valuation methodology 
the company believes that its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of these securities  however  had there been an active market for these securities during the applicable reporting period  the market prices may have been materially different than the amounts reported 
declines in the fair value of investments that are considered in the judgment of management to be other than temporary are reported as realized investment losses 
management evaluates  among other things  the financial position and prospects of the issuer  conditions in the issuer s industry and geographic area  liquidity of the investment  changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the investment  and recent changes in credit ratings of the issuer by a rating agency to determine if and when a decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is other than temporary 
the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment is lower than its amortized cost and the company s ability and intent to retain the investment to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s fair value are also considered 
in  and  the company recognized losses totaling million  million and million  respectively  for the other than temporary decline in the value of various fixed maturity and other securities 
these losses were recognized as a result of events that occurred in the respective periods  such as downgrades in an issuer s credit ratings  deteriorating financial results of issuers  adverse changes in the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from securities and the impact of adverse economic conditions on issuers financial positions 
investment grade and non investment grade fixed maturity securities comprised and  respectively  of the company s total investment portfolio at december  gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation  before the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  attributable to investment grade fixed maturity securities totaled million and million  respectively  at december  gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation  before the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  attributable to non investment grade fixed maturity securities totaled million and million  respectively  at december  unrealized appreciation and depreciation  net of the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  has been reflected on the company s balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income 
the company anticipates that if certain existing declines in security values are determined to be other than temporary  it may recognize additional investment losses in the range of million to million pre tax million to million on an after tax basis with respect to the relevant securities 
however  the extent of any such losses will depend on future market developments and changes in security values  and such losses may exceed or be lower than such range 
it is not possible to predict the extent of any future changes in value  positive or negative  or the results of the future application of the company s procedures for the evaluation of other than temporary impairment in valuation 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize investment gains in the future in an amount sufficient to offset any such losses 
the company also invests in certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies which invest in various financial instruments 
these investments are reflected in the company s financial statements under the equity method  accordingly  positive or negative changes in the value of the investees underlying investments are included in net investment income 
for this purpose  the company estimates the values of its investments in these entities based on values provided by their managers 
the company believes that its estimates reasonably reflect the values of its investments in these entities  however  there can be no assurance that such values will ultimately be realized upon liquidation of such investments  which generally can occur only through a redemption or withdrawal from the various entities  since no trading market exists for these investments 
such redemptions and withdrawals are generally available only at specified intervals upon the giving of specified prior notice to the applicable entity
