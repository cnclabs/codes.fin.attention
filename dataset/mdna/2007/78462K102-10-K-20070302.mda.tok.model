because of the nature of the company s business  management frequently discusses the timing of deferred revenue and the impact of this timing on the company s financial results 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenue by selling software licenses 
software licenses may be term licenses or perpetual licenses 
if spss sells a term license  the revenue associated with this license is deferred over the term of the license 
if spss sells a perpetual license  the license revenue is generally recognized immediately but the revenue associated with maintenance of this license is deferred over the contracted maintenance period which is typically a month period
