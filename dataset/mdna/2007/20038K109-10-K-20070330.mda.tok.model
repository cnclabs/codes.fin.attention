item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion set forth below supplements the information found in the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of comforce corporation comforce and its wholly owned subsidiaries  including comforce operating  inc coi collectively  the company 

table of contents overview and recent developments staffing personnel placed by the company are employees of the company 
the company is responsible for employment related expenses for its employees  including workers compensation  unemployment compensation insurance  medicare and social security taxes and general payroll expenses 
the company offers health  dental  k  disability and life insurance to its eligible employees 
staffing and consulting companies  including the company  typically pay their billable employees for their services before receiving payment from their customers  resulting in significant outstanding receivables 
to the extent the company grows  these receivables will increase and there will be greater need for borrowing availability under the pnc credit facility 
at march   the company had outstanding million principal amount under the pnc credit facility with remaining availability of million  as defined in the loan agreement  to fund operations 
the company reports its results through three operating segments human capital management services  staff augmentation and financial outsourcing services 
the human capital management services segment primarily provides staffing management services that enable fortune companies and other large employers to consolidate  automate and manage staffing  compliance and oversight processes for their contingent workforces 
the staff augmentation segment provides healthcare support services  technical and engineering  information technology  telecommunications and other staffing needs 
the financial outsourcing services segment provides funding and back office support services to independent consulting and staffing companies 
management of the company has observed improvement in the business environment for staffing companies beginning in the first quarter of industry statistics have generally supported management s observations including  since the beginning of  improvement in the rate of job creation in the united states  however management is unsure how long these trends will continue in the future 
as previously reported  one of the company s staff augmentation customers is auditing the invoices made under the contract with the company for the years to management does not believe any adjustment to the company s fees under this contract is warranted 
the company s fiscal year consists of the or weeks ending on the last sunday in december 
the company s most recently completed fiscal year ended on december  fiscal year contained weeks and fiscal years and each contained weeks 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion in this item addresses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
a discussion of the more significant estimates follows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company has an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected 
this allowance is calculated on the trade receivables with consideration for the company s historical write off experience  the current aging of receivables  general economic climate and the financial condition of customers 
after giving due consideration to these factors  the company establishes specific allowances for uncollectible accounts 
the allowance for the funding and service fee receivables is calculated with consideration for the ability of the company s clients to absorb chargebacks due to the uncollectibility of the funded receivables 
bad debt expense  which increases the allowance for doubtful accounts  is recorded as an operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
factors that would cause this provision to increase primarily relate to increased bankruptcies by customers  the inability of the company s funding services clients to absorb chargebacks and other difficulties collecting amounts billed 
on the other hand  an improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease to the provision 

table of contents accrued workers compensation liability the company records its estimate of the ultimate cost of  and liabilities for  workers compensation based on actuarial computations using the company s loss history as well as industry statistics 
furthermore  in determining its liabilities  the company includes amounts for estimated claims incurred but not reported 
the ultimate cost of workers compensation will depend on actual costs incurred to settle the claims and may differ from the liabilities recorded for those claims 
accruals for workers compensation claims are included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
a significant increase in claims or changes in laws may require the company to record additional expenses related to workers compensation 
on the other hand  significantly improved claim experience may result in lower annual expense levels 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which realization of the asset is not considered more likely than not 
management s judgment is required in determining the realizability of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances recorded 
the net deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted in the event that tax rates are modified  or management s estimates of future taxable income change  such that deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled at a different tax rate than currently estimated 
in addition  valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the event that management s estimate of future taxable income changes from the amounts currently estimated 
the company provides for income taxes on a quarterly basis based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate 
in determining this rate  management estimates taxable income for each of the jurisdictions where the company operates  as well as the tax rate that will be in effect for each state and foreign country 
to the extent these estimates change during the year  or that actual results differ from these estimates  the estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year 
goodwill impairment the company is required to test goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas as of the end of each fiscal year or earlier during each fiscal year as circumstances require 
in connection with these goodwill tests  the company engages an independent valuation firm to assist management in the determination of the fair values of its reporting units as defined by sfas 
in its determination of the fair values  the firm engaged by the company primarily utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis as well as various other valuation approaches  including i capitalization multiples of companies with investment characteristics resembling those of the reporting units  ii the enterprise value of the company  and iii asset and liability structure 
significant assumptions used in this analysis include i expected future revenue growth rates  operating unit profit margins  and working capital levels  ii a discount rate  and iii a terminal value multiple 
the revenue growth rates  working capital levels and operating unit profit margins are based on management s expectation of future results 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of the company s reporting units could change significantly 
such a change could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents share based payment with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  effective december   we are required to record the fair value of share based payment awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our shares using daily price observations over a period consistent with the expected life 
we use the safe harbor guidance in sab to estimate the expected life of options granted during fiscal the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods similar to the expected life 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that  typically  are based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates

selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of services were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher personnel costs incurred to support the increase in consultant consolidation services provided in the human capital management services segment discussed above and an increase of corporate expenses associated with personnel costs and professional fees

the interest expense of million for fiscal was lower as compared to the interest expense of million for fiscal this reduction was principally due to the repurchase of million of senior notes in fiscal and the repurchase and redemption of million of senior notes in fiscal these decreases were partially offset by increased interest expense on the company s revolving line of credit due to higher average interest rates and borrowings in fiscal the company also expects interest expense reductions in future periods due to the redemption and repurchase of its senior notes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of the company s borrowings are fixed rate obligations  including million principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and million principal amount of convertible notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the estimated fair value of these debt obligations at december  was million for the senior notes  and million for the convertible notes 
management of the company does not believe that a increase in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair value of these fixed rate obligations 
borrowings under the pnc credit facility aggregating million at december  are at variable interest rates  and interest expense will be impacted by changes in interest rates generally prevailing in the united states and internationally 
assuming an immediate increase in the weighted average interest rate of the impact to the company in annualized interest expense would be approximately  the company has not entered into any swap agreements or other hedging transactions as a means of limiting exposure to interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations 
the company provides its services in several countries  however  based upon the current level of investments in these countries  it does not believe that a change in foreign currency rates would have a material impact to its financial position
