general valassis reported revenues of  million for  down from the cooperative fsi industry experienced a unit page growth in while industry page growth was positive  our fsi market share decreased and overall fsi pricing declined approximately in  in comparison to these factors had a negative impact on profits in the fsi segment 
management anticipates fsi pricing to be down by a similar percentage versus as the result of an aggressive competitive environment and renegotiation of certain customer contracts 
due to the multi year nature of fsi customer contracts  the economic impact of the competitive pricing environment will continue into future periods even if the pricing environment were to improve 
during  we continued our strategy to grow and diversify our customer base 
for the years ended december  and december   the composition of our revenue is as follows year ended dec

 consumer packaged goods manufacturers telecommunications specialty retailers food service direct response marketers consumer services grocery  drug and mass retailers other types of customers in furtherance of our strategy to grow and diversify our customer base  on july   we  michigan acquisition corporation  our wholly owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of the acquisition  and advo entered into an agreement and plan of merger  pursuant to which we agreed to acquire advo through the merger of michigan acquisition corporation with and into advo  with advo surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary

on september   advo filed an answer denying our allegations and asserting counterclaims for specific performance and damages 
on december   the parties commenced a trial in the delaware chancery court 
on december   we reached a settlement of this litigation pursuant to which the original merger agreement was amended and we  michigan acquisition corporation and advo entered into amendment no 
to the agreement and plan of merger  which together with the agreement and plan of merger  we refer to as the amended merger agreement 
as part of the agreement  the parties agreed to dismiss with prejudice their litigation in the court of chancery for new castle county  delaware 
the acquisition is subject to approval of the amended merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of advo common stock at a special meeting scheduled to be held on february  and the absence of any injunction or other legal restraint prohibiting the merger 
pursuant to the terms of the amended merger agreement  the closing of the acquisition is required to occur no later than the second business day after satisfaction of these conditions  provided  however  that so long as we comply with our obligation under the amended merger agreement to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the financing necessary to complete the acquisition we are permitted to extend the closing date to not later than march  if and to the extent necessary or desirable in order to obtain such financing 
the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of march at the effective time of the merger  each share of advo common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive in cash per share 
if the merger is not completed by the later of i february  or ii the second business day following approval of the amended merger agreement by stockholders of advo  the consideration per share of advo common stock will be increased by interest  to the extent permitted by applicable law  on the in cash per share of advo common stock at a rate per year equal to the sum of i the federal reserve discount rate as reported from time to time in the wall street journal plus ii five hundred basis points  increasing by a further one hundred basis points at the beginning of each month thereafter commencing april  from february  until the completion of the merger

operating costs cost of sales was million in compared to million in and million in  increasing as a percentage of revenue each year 
gross margin in was  compared to in and in the continued decrease in gross margin percentage from compared to and was primarily the result of competitive pricing issues in the fsi segment 
fsi unit costs were down slightly as the result of decreases in paper costs  media distribution rates and print costs 
additionally  the gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by a change in mix resulting in a larger percentage of sales from lower margin products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in to million versus million in this increase is primarily the result of million in legal and professional expenses related to the merger agreement and related litigation between valassis and advo incurred during as well as million in expenses related to the close down of the french agency business and esettlement business unit of nch

without these unusual charges sg a decreased despite the recognition of million in stock option expense due to declines in performance based incentive plans and headcount reductions made at the end of non operating items interest expense was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in expense is due largely to million in charges related to the termination of a million interest rate swap contract and premiums paid for two separate million interest rate swaption contracts

in addition  although industry volume was up approximately  a slight decline in our market share resulted in a reduction in our pages produced 
fsi unit costs were down approximately as a result of reductions in the cost of paper  media insertion and printing 
fsi segment profit was million in versus million in due primarily to pricing 
in  fsi revenue increased to million compared to the increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in units pages due to industry growth and a gain in market share  offset by a slight reduction in co op fsi pricing 
the cooperative fsi industry continued to show unit growth with industry pages increasing by a percentage in the mid single digits in fsi unit costs were up slightly as a result of mid single digit percentage increases in paper costs 
paper represents approximately of the cost of sales for our fsi business 
valassis purchases a combination of coated and uncoated paper 
to protect valassis against the risk of price fluctuations  a significant portion of our paper requirements is purchased from three paper companies under long term contracts 
these contracts limit the amount of increases or decreases to approximately in any month period of valassis cost of paper purchased from these suppliers 
such cost can be adjusted quarterly 
as of january   approximately of our fsi paper requirements were under long term contract 
the remainder of our paper requirement is bought pursuant to contracts that are typically three to six months in duration or on a spot basis 
rop rop revenue decreased to million in  from million in  primarily due to a shift in mix between full service revenue and transaction fee based business 
total rop business placed was approximately million in the telecommunications sector continues to drive this business and represented approximately of total revenue 
segment profit was million in versus million in this gain in profitability is primarily due to the favorable impact of increased volume 
revenue for rop increased in to million from million in  due to acquisition of new retail and cpg customers 
the gross margin in this segment also improved and operating profits grew in excess of for telecommunications advertising represented approximately of our rop business in neighborhood targeted neighborhood targeted revenue decreased in to million versus million in the primary causes of this decrease were pull backs in spending due to consolidations within the telecommunications and appliance manufacturing industries  as well as a decrease in spending by a major specialty retailer 
the segment also experienced increased competitive pressure resulting in lower margins 
segment profit declined to million in versus million in our neighborhood targeted revenue increased in to million versus million in the major driver of this growth was increased demand for printing and placement of solo inserts from the retail  food service  telecommunications and manufacturer customer verticals 
household targeted the household targeted segment had revenues of million in  a decrease of from million in this was primarily the result of a decline in revenue related to the close down of prevision as a stand alone entity at the end of we effectively exited the customer relationship marketing agency business and now provide these services only to customers placing their related media campaigns with us 
profitability improved significantly as a result of this restructuring 
segment profit for was million versus a loss in of million 
the household targeted segment had revenue of million in  an increase of over million in  despite the fact that we no longer had access to a major retailer s data affecting our ability to sell certain direct mail programs in we also repositioned this segment at the end of by fully integrating our products and services and eliminating prevision marketing  llc as a stand alone entity 
international services international services revenue increased in to million versus million in this increase was primarily the result of increased revenues from new media products in france 
in addition  revenues from canada grew as more solo preprint programs were run in segment profit declined to million in versus million in as the result of a million charge relating to the close down of the french agency business and the esettlement business unit of nch 
the international services segment contributed revenues of million in  a increase over million in valassis implemented a restructuring plan for the european coupon clearing operations which adversely affected the overall profitability of this segment during the fourth quarter of financial condition  liquidity and sources of capital valassis liquidity requirements arise mainly from its working capital needs  primarily accounts receivable  inventory and debt service requirements 
cooperative fsi customers except remnant space customers are generally billed for of each order eight weeks in advance of the publication date and the balance is billed immediately prior to the publication date 
fsi revenue accounted for of valassis total revenue in valassis inventories work in progress at cost while it accrues progress billings as a current liability at full sales value 
although valassis receives considerable payments from its customers prior to the publication of promotions  revenue is recognized only upon publication dates 
therefore  the progress billings on the balance sheet include any profits in the related receivables 
valassis invoices all of its rop customers for gross media costs and fees  if applicable 
media costs account for approximately of our total direct rop costs 
our customers generally require proof of performance before we issue an invoice to them 
it is our policy to pay the newspapers only after we receive such proof of performance 
accordingly  although rop receivables average a higher number of days outstanding  we generally have a corresponding delay in payments to the newspapers 
the majority of the revenue generated by nch  a owned subsidiary of valassis  is from its coupon clearing business 
nch invoices the face value of the coupon  a retailer handling fee if applicable as well as nch s processing fee 
the face value and the retailer handling fee are ultimately remitted by nch to retailers and their agents 
nch records a gross receivable and payable for the coupon face value as well as the retailer handling fees and recognizes revenue only on the nch processing fee 
sources and uses of cash cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  versus million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of a million reduction in earnings in compared to  coupled with a decrease in working capital related to receivables and prepayments related to customer contract incentives 
cash flow from operating activities was million in this is the result of net earnings of million adjusted for non cash items  the largest of which are depreciation and amortization totaling million 
in  changes in working capital items accounted for a million decrease in cash primarily due to an increase in days outstanding in rop receivables that was not fully offset by an increase in the corresponding payables to the newspapers 
working capital also decreased due to prepayments made associated with customer contract incentives 
during  changes in working capital items accounted for a million decrease in cash 
net cash used in investing activities was million primarily as a result of million in net purchases of auction rate securities and capital expenditures of million 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ending december   primarily driven by repayment of million of debt 
we suspended our share repurchase program in february  therefore cash used in financing activities was significantly lower in than in current and long term debt as of december   valassis debt was million  which consisted of million million  net of discount of its senior notes due and million of senior convertible notes due we had a revolving line of credit of million with a variable rate of interest calculated on either a euro currency based rate or a prime rate  which expired in november and valassis elected not to renew it at such time in light of the pending advo acquisition 
during the year ended december   there was no outstanding balance under this line of credit 
valassis was in compliance with all debt covenants at december  all of our long term debt contains cross default provisions which become applicable if we default under any mortgage  indebtedness or instrument for money borrowed by valassis and the default results in the acceleration of such indebtedness in excess of million 
additionally  each of the senior convertible notes contains conversion triggers based upon credit rating downgrades by either moody s investor service  inc or standard poor s rating group 
on june   the majority of the holders of valassis zero coupon senior convertible notes due the notes put their notes to valassis at a price of per note for million in cash 
cash paid was equal to the accreted value of the debt recorded and no gain or loss was recognized 
the remaining  of the notes were called by valassis on june  and settled in cash at the same price on july  the holders of the senior convertible notes due the notes receive cash interest payments of per year on the original discounted amount  payable semiannually from through the holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on may   may   may   may  and may  at a price of    and per note  respectively  payable in cash 
also  each holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes if a change of control of valassis occurs 
valassis  at its option  may redeem all or a portion of the notes at their accreted value at any time on or after may   for cash 
on august   valassis entered into a forward dated million libor swap contract and a forward dated million libor swaption contract as a bridge hedge for a portion of the acquisition financing related to the proposed advo acquisition 
valassis terminated the swap on september  and did not exercise its swaption contract which expired on september  on the same day  valassis entered into a new forward dated million european libor swaption contract with an expiration date of february  at a strike price of 
the termination of the swap and the mark to market adjustments of the premiums on the swaptions resulted in incremental interest expense of million in the year ended december  valassis has a million asset at december  for the premium on the new swaption contract which will be marked to market over the reporting period through february  the swap and swaption derivative contracts served to convert a portion of the proposed senior credit facility  which would bear a variable rate of interest  to a fixed rate 
the derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
and are stated at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value being charged to interest expense during the period in which they arise 
on june   s p downgraded our credit rating from bbb to bb in reaction to our public announcement of lower earnings for fiscal year on july   s p downgraded our credit rating one additional notch from bb to bb in anticipation of the proposed leverage of the advo acquisition and we remain on credit watch 
on october   moody s downgraded our credit rating from baa to ba due to its belief that there is significant earnings pressure due to fsi pricing in  customer consolidation in the neighborhood targeted segment and our willingness to have a more aggressive leverage profile 
this downgrade did not trigger conversion of the notes 
in addition  the financing which would be required in connection with the proposed advo acquisition would significantly increase our level of debt and may lower our debt rating further which could trigger conversion of the notes 
however  it is anticipated that the conversion price would be out of the money 
lower debt ratings may increase our cost of borrowing as well as adversely affect our access to the capital markets 
see item a risk factors we may be unable to consummate our pending acquisition of advo 
if we do consummate the pending acquisition  we will be required to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial health and make it more difficult for us to service our debt or obtain additional financing in the future  if necessary 
future commitments and contractual obligations valassis intends to use cash generated by operations to meet interest and principal repayment obligations  for general corporate purposes  to reduce its indebtedness and to make acquisitions 
as of december   valassis had authorization to repurchase an additional million shares of its common stock under its existing share repurchase programs 
management believes we will generate sufficient funds from operations and will have sufficient lines of credit available to meet anticipated liquidity needs  including interest and required payments of indebtedness 
valassis contractual obligations as of december   are as follows payments due by period in thousands of us dollars total less than year years years more than years public debt interest on public debt operating leases other long term liabilities non current long term debt is included at face value 
in addition  we have entered into the amended merger agreement with advo 
see general for a description of valassis obligations in connection therewith 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   valassis did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for the year ended december   largely representing technology enhancements and payments on a new printing press 
for the valassis business  management expects future capital expenditure requirements of approximately million over each of the next three years to meet the business needs of enhancing technology and replacing equipment as required 
it is expected these expenditures will be made using funds provided by operations 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas r on january  the standard requires that all equity based compensation be recorded in the financial statements at the grant date fair value 
valassis applied this statement to all unvested awards outstanding as of december  and all awards granted on or after january  compensation cost is being recognized on and after january  for the fair value of new grants issued and for the unvested portion of outstanding awards at that date based on the grant date fair value of these awards previously calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures 
the adoption of sfas r resulted in the recognition of an additional million of stock compensation expense in prior period financial statements are not restated to reflect the effect of sfas r 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after june  as such  valassis adopted these provisions on january  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
specifically  the pronouncement prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on the related derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods  disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as such  we will adopt these provisions as of january  we are currently evaluating the impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
the provisions of sab are effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  as such valassis adopted these provisions for the fiscal year ended december  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  rather it applies under existing accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt sfas no 
as required and do not expect a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
for additional information see note  significant accounting policies  of our financial statements included in item valassis does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets historically have been reviewed for impairment at least annually in december and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
revenue recognition fsi revenue from fsis and custom cooperative fsis is recognized in the period that the product is distributed in the newspaper 
in accordance with industry practice  valassis generally pre bills fsi customers except remnant space in advance of the related distribution date 
however  these billings are reflected as progress billings liability until the appropriate distribution period 
provision for rebates or pricing adjustments are made at the time that the related revenue is recognized 
rop rop revenue is recognized on the date that the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
some customers have contracts whereby valassis earns a transaction fee and the media costs are pass through costs to the customer 
in such cases  valassis only recognizes the transaction fee as revenue on the date the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
customer contracts can vary  which may lead to material changes in revenue recognized for this segment  while not materially affecting absolute gross margin dollars 
neighborhood targeted the majority of neighborhood targeted products are newspaper delivered and revenue is recognized in the period that the product is distributed 
for non newspaper delivered products  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or distributed to the consumer via direct to door 
household targeted revenue for direct mail products is recognized when the product is accepted by the united states postal service for insertion into the mail stream 
in most cases  postage costs are passed through directly to the customer and are not recognized as revenue 
revenues from software products are recognized per installation and revenues from services are recognized on a percent complete method 
international services revenue for coupon clearing does not include the face value of the coupons processed or the retailer service fee 
however  customers are billed for the face value and retailer fee which are included in both accounts receivable and accounts payable 
once coupon processing has been completed  fee revenues are recognized 
stock compensation valassis grants stock options to its employees under various incentive plans 
options are granted with exercise prices at least equal to the fair value on the date of grant 
effective january   valassis accounts for all options under sfas no 
r  share based payment  and utilizes the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make various estimates in calculating expense as required by sfas no 
r 
customer contract incentives valassis occasionally provides upfront cash incentives to key customers to secure the value of a long term contract 
the cost of such incentives are capitalized and amortized as a reduction to revenue over the life of the customer contract to match the associated value of the contract 
derivative financial instruments valassis uses derivative financial instruments  including forward foreign exchange and swap contracts  to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the use of these financial instruments mitigates our exposure to these risks with the intent of reducing the risks and the variability of our operating results 
valassis is not a party to leveraged derivatives 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  valassis designates the derivative as either a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation a net investment hedge 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet 
when the underlying hedged transaction is realized  the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss is recorded in earnings and reflected in the consolidated statement of income on the same line as the hedged item 
in addition  both changes in the fair value excluded from our effectiveness assessments and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value are recorded in earnings and reflected in the consolidated statement of income as other expense  net 
valassis formally documents its hedge relationships  including the identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction 
derivatives are recorded at fair value in other current and long term assets and other current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
this process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets  liabilities  firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether a derivative used in a hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting 
hedge ineffectiveness  determined in accordance with sfas no 
 did not have a material impact on operations for  or no cash flow hedges were re designated or discontinued during or on august   valassis entered into a forward dated million libor swap contract and a forward dated million libor swaption contract as a bridge hedge for a portion of the acquisition financing related to the proposed advo acquisition 
on september   valassis terminated the swap and did not exercise its swaption contract which expired on september  on the same day  valassis entered into a new forward dated million european libor swaption contract with an expiration date of february  at a strike price of 
the termination of the swap and the swaption premiums resulted in an incremental interest expense of million during the year ended december  valassis has a million asset at december  for the premium on the new swaption contract that will be marked to market over the reporting period through february  the swap and swaption derivative contracts served to convert a portion of the proposed senior credit facility  which will bear a variable rate of interest  to a fixed rate 
the derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
and will be stated at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value being charged to interest expense during the period in which they arise 
other matters valassis does not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities 
business outlook the following statements are based on current expectations for without giving effect to the pending advo acquisition 
these statements are forward looking and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially 
see the introductory paragraph to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a risk factors 
regarding  we expect revenue increases in our rop  neighborhood targeted  household targeted and international services business segments 
in our fsi business segment  we expect fsi pricing to continue to trend downward in similar to the decline experienced in of approximately 
we expect to be able to lower our fsi costs on a cost per thousand basis  but this will not offset the reduced fsi pricing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are foreign exchange rates at valassis international subsidiaries  interest rates on various debt instruments and credit risk on investments 
foreign currency currencies to which valassis has exposure are the mexican peso  canadian dollar  british pound and the euro 
currency restrictions are not expected to have a significant effect on our cash flows  liquidity  or capital resources 
valassis typically purchases the mexican peso under three to month forward foreign exchange contracts to stabilize the cost of coupon clearing in mexico 
under sfas no 
 our mexican peso forward exchange contracts meet the definition of a cash flow hedge 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   we recorded an immaterial unrealized market value gain in other comprehensive income 
actual exchange losses or gains are recorded against production expense when the contracts are executed 
as of december   valassis had a commitment to purchase million in mexican pesos over the next months 
interest rates on september   valassis entered into million libor swaption contract as a bridge hedge for a portion of the acquisition financing related to the pending advo acquisition pursuant to a merger agreement 
the swaption derivative contract serves to convert a portion of the proposed senior credit facility which will bear a variable rate of interest to a fixed rate 
significant fluctuations in libor could cause a material earnings impact as well as require material cash commitments or cash settlement
