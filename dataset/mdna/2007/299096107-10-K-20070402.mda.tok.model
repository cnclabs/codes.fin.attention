risk factors our domestic and international businesses operate in highly competitive markets that involve a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the sale of the simulation business to rockwell collins on may   has significantly changed our business 
as a result  there are new risks and uncertainties that should be considered in evaluating our business 
the following discussion highlights some risks and uncertainties that should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
our business model has changed and may not produce consistent earnings which could adversely affect our business with the sale of our simulation business to rockwell collins  our business model has significantly changed 
our business is now based on digital theaters and laser projectors 
a significant portion of our future success will depend on completing and selling our laser projector  and future products based on this technology 
there is no guarantee that the laser projector or any future products based on this technology will be successful in the market or that we can develop them 
if we are unable to develop our laser projector  our business will be adversely affected 
we may experience difficulty in identifying  forming and maintaining new business opportunities that are important to the development of our business we have invested  and expect to continue to invest  significant capital in new products  technologies  and business opportunities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to identify suitable opportunities to expand our business in the future 
the failure to form or maintain new business opportunities could significantly limit our ability to expand our operations and sales 
moreover  these new opportunities or investments require significant management time  involve a high degree of risk and will present significant challenges 
we cannot assure you that these activities will be successful or that we will realize appropriate returns on these activities 
our laser projectors are new and have limited market penetration our laser projectors have limited market penetration 
our future success will depend in significant part on our ability to generate demand for our laser projectors and to develop additional commercial applications that incorporate our laser projector technology 
we cannot be certain that our product will succeed in the market  and if we fail to generate increased sales  our future results of operations will be adversely affected 
we may be unable to adequately respond to rapid changes in technology the market for our laser projectors is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions 
the introduction of products and services embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards may render our existing laser projectors obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to adapt to change 
a significant factor in our ability to grow and to remain competitive is our ability to successfully introduce new products and services that embody new technology  anticipate and incorporate evolving industry standards and achieve levels of functionality and prices acceptable to the market 
if our laser projectors are unable to meet our customers needs or we are unable to keep pace with technological changes in the industry  our laser projectors could eventually become obsolete 
we may be unable to allocate the funds necessary to improve our current products or introduce new products to address our customers needs and respond to technological change 
if other companies develop more technologically advanced products  our competitive position relative to such companies would be harmed 
competitors or third parties may infringe e s intellectual property throughout its history e s has been awarded numerous patents 
while competitors or third parties have not materially infringed our patents  we are entering the production stage of a new product  the eslp 
we have a number of patents either issued or pending on this technology  but it represents a new field for us and may attract competitors with a risk of infringement and costly legal processes to defend our intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business 
delays in new product introductions could negatively affect financial performance during and into  we have introduced and intend to introduce several important new products  including the eslp 
further delays in introducing and delivering these products could reduce planned sales and profit contribution 
our industry is undergoing rapid technological changes  and our failure to keep up with such changes could cause us to lose customers and impede our ability to attract new customers our success depends on our ability to compete in an industry that is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and products that require constant improvement in both price and performance 
we expect this trend to continue 
if our competitors are more successful than we are in developing technology and products  then our revenues and growth rates could decline 
our industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology as well as customer requirements and preferences  and our failure to keep up with such changes could cause us to lose customers and impede our ability to attract new customers 
new technologies could reduce the competitiveness of our theater and projector products 
we may be required to select one technology over another  but at a time when it would be impossible to predict with any certainty which technology will prove to be the most economic  efficient or capable of attracting customer usage 
subsequent technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our products and require upgrades or additional products that could be expensive or unfeasible 
if we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or customer preferences  we could lose market share or impede our ability to attract new customers and retain current customers 
resistance by potential new customers to accept our products may reduce our ability to increase our revenue the expansion of our business will be dependent upon  among other things  the willingness of additional customers to accept our products and technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the resistance of potential customers to change their current projectors or theater technologies  and to expend the capital necessary to purchase and implement our products and technology 
the lack of customer acceptance would reduce our ability to increase our revenue 
our sales could decline substantially as a result of terrorist attacks and other activities that reduce the willingness of our customers to purchase products the demand for our products and services is dependent upon new orders from customers operating various public attractions 
if terrorist attacks or other activities decrease the attendance for our customers venues  the demand or willingness of our customers to purchase our products may decline and our revenue may decline substantially 
our shareholders may not realize certain opportunities because of the anti takeover effect of state law the utah control shares acquisition act provides that any person who acquires or more of the outstanding voting shares of a publicly held utah corporation will not have voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested shareholders of the corporation votes to grant such rights 
this could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or other advantages that large accumulations of stock would provide because anyone interested in acquiring e s could only do so with the cooperation of our board of directors and a majority of disinterested shareholders 
your ability to sell your stock may be substantially limited if we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of the nasdaq national market  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq national market  we expect our common stock will be traded on the nasdaq capital market if we meet the listing standards of that market or we will attempt to be traded on the otc bulletin board or pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc the otc bulletin board and pink sheets are generally considered less efficient markets than the nasdaq national market and the nasdaq capital market 
we may receive none or little of the remaining million in escrow related to the sale of assets to rockwell collins and the laser projector agreement as part of the asset purchase agreement and laser agreement  a total  remains in an escrow account to secure our indemnification obligations under the asset purchase agreement and our delivery obligations under the laser agreement 
there is no guarantee that we will receive these funds and if rockwell collins becomes entitled to a penalty under the laser agreement or indemnification under the asset purchase agreement  we may receive none or little of the  remaining in escrow  which will reduce the amount of cash we have available in the future 
if we do not deliver a motion based eslp to rockwell collins by december   rockwell collins has the right to begin accelerating monthly withdrawals from the escrow account in accordance with a formula prescribed by the laser agreement 
under the formula  the monthly withdrawals will total  over the year following december  if we do not deliver a motion based eslp by december   rockwell collins will have the right to withdraw up to an additional  from the escrow account 
we continue to be exposed to contingent liabilities relating to the sale of our simulation business  which could adversely affect our financial condition in connection with the sale of our simulation business  we agreed to indemnify rockwell collins for any losses from breaches of the representations  warranties or covenants we made in the asset purchase agreement that occur within certain periods after the closing 
we have also agreed that certain indemnification obligations will be capped at certain amounts 
for example  an indemnification claim by rockwell collins could result if rockwell collins suffers any damages arising out of the inaccuracy of any of our representations or if we fail to comply with a covenant or other agreement in the asset purchase agreement 
in addition  we have agreed to retain all liabilities relating to the simulation business that are not being expressly assumed by rockwell collins  and to indemnify rockwell collins for any claims or damages arising from such retained liabilities 
the payment of any such indemnification obligations could adversely impact our cash resources following the completion of the sale of our simulator business and our ability to pursue other opportunities  including the development of our digital theater and laser projector businesses 
we may not be able to fully integrate spitz into our operations successfully we may experience difficulties in fully integrating spitz s business with ours 
this could result in additional costs and loss of productivity that could materially affect our operations and financial results 
if we are unable to retain certain key personnel and hire new highly skilled personnel  we may not be able to execute our business plan we are substantially dependent on the continued services of certain key personnel 
these individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to the company and its operations 
the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 
our business is also dependent on our ability to retain  hire and motivate talented  highly skilled personnel 
if we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and in attracting new key personnel  we may be unable to meet our business plan and as a result  our stock price may decline 
item properties our principal executive  engineering  manufacturing and operations facilities are located in the university of utah research park in salt lake city  utah  where we own three buildings totaling approximately  square feet 
the buildings are located on land leased from the university of utah with an initial term of years or longer 
spitz owns and occupies an approximately  square foot building on approximately acres in chadds ford  pennsylvania 
the property serves as collateral under spitz s debt agreements through a mortgage granted to first keystone bank 
we believe that these properties are suitable for our immediate needs and we do not currently plan to expand our facilities or relocate to other facilities 
item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we may have various legal claims and other contingent matters 
we know of no legal claims or other contingent matters outstanding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal year part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities our common stock trades on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol escc 
on march   there were holders of record of our common stock 
because brokers and other institutions hold many of our shares on behalf of shareholders  we are unable to estimate the total number of shareholders represented by these record holders 
we have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock and have used retained earnings for the operation and expansion of our business 
currently we have an accumulated deficit 
for the foreseeable future  we intend to follow our policy of retaining any future earnings to finance the development and growth of our business
