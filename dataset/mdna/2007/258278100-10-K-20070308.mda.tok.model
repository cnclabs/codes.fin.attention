overview we are a leading supplier of original equipment oe dealer exclusive automotive replacement parts  automotive hardware  brake products  and household hardware to the automotive aftermarket and mass merchandise markets 
dorman automotive parts and hardware are marketed under the oe solutions  help  autograde  first stop  conduct tite  pik a nut  and scan tech brand names 
we design  package and market over  different automotive replacement parts including brake parts  fasteners and service line products manufactured to our specifications 
our products are sold under one of the seven dorman brand names listed above 
our products are sold primarily in the united states through automotive aftermarket retailers such as autozone  advance and o reilly  national  regional and local warehouse distributors such as carquest and napa and specialty markets including parts manufacturers for resale under their own private labels and salvage yards 
through our scan tech and hermoff subsidiaries  we are increasing our international distribution of automotive replacement parts  with sales into canada  europe  the middle east and the far east 

index the automotive aftermarket in which we compete has been growing in size  however  the market continues to consolidate 
as a result  our customers regularly seek more favorable pricing  product returns and extended payment terms when negotiating with us 
while we do our best to avoid such concessions  in some cases pricing concessions have been made  customer payment terms have been extended and returns of product have exceeded historical levels 
the product returns and more favorable pricing primarily affect our profit levels while terms extensions generally reduce operating cash flow and require additional capital to finance the business 
we expect both of these trends to continue for the foreseeable future 
gross profit margins have declined over the past two years as a result of this pricing pressure 
another contributing factor in our gross profit margin decline is a shift in mix to higher priced  but lower gross margin products 
both of these trends are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have increased our focus on efficiency improvements and product cost reduction initiatives to offset the impact of price pressures 
in addition  we are relying on new product development as a way to offset some of these customer demands and as our primary vehicle for growth 
as such  new product development is a critical success factor for us 
we have invested heavily in resources necessary for us to increase our new product development efforts and to strengthen our relationships with our customers 
these investments are primarily in the form of increased product development resources and awareness programs  customer service improvements and increased customer credits and allowances 
this has enabled us to provide an expanding array of new product offerings and grow our revenues 
we may experience significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter in our results of operations due to the timing of orders placed by our customers 
generally  the second and third quarters have the highest level of customer orders  but the introduction of new products and product lines to customers may cause significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
we operate on a fifty two  fifty three week period ending on the last saturday of the calendar year 
the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  were fifty two  fifty three  and fifty two weeks  respectively 
stock split all prior period common stock and applicable share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a two for one split in the form of a stock dividend of our common stock effective march  write off of goodwill and deferred tax asset related to swedish subsidiary during the second quarter of fiscal  we assessed the value of the goodwill recorded at our swedish subsidiary scan tech as a result of a review of the scan tech business in response to bad debt charge offs of two large customers and the resulting loss of those customers in the first half of the year 
after completing the required analyses  we concluded that the goodwill at the subsidiary was impaired 
accordingly  an impairment charge of approximately million  which represented the entire goodwill balance at the subsidiary  was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we recorded a million charge to our provision for income taxes to write off deferred tax assets of the subsidiary which were deemed unrealizable 
acquisition in june  we acquired the automotive edge hermoff hermoff for approximately million 
the consolidated results include hermoff since june  we have not presented pro forma results of operations for the years ended december  and december   assuming the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the respective periods  as these results would not have been materially different than actual results for the periods 

index stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r and related interpretations and began expensing the grant date fair value of employee stock options 
prior to january   we applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized in net income for employee stock options for those options granted which had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated prior periods 
under this transition method  compensation cost associated with employee stock options recognized in includes amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of stock option awards granted prior to january   and amortization related to new awards granted after january  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we presented tax benefits resulting from stock based compensation as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized in the financial statements be classified as financing cash flows 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period during which employees perform related services 
the compensation cost charged against income for the year ended december  was million before taxes 
the compensation cost recognized is classified as selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations percentage of net sales year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill impairment income from operations interest expense  net income before taxes provision for taxes net income fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased to million in from million in revenues in increased primarily as a result of increases in revenue from new products 
results for include an extra week s sales due to the week year 
the loss of an extra week s sales in was somewhat offset by a full year s sales from the hermoff acquisition made in june cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  increased to in from in the prior year 
the increase is the result of gross margin reductions in several product lines due to higher customer allowances and selling price reductions due to competitive pressures 
we offset a portion of these increased selling price reductions through material cost savings from suppliers 
selling  general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million in the increase is the result of the addition of a new distribution center in  inflationary cost increases and higher variable costs as a result of our sales increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses in also include a million increase in bad debt expense primarily as a result of the write off of two large scan tech accounts receivable  million in additional financing costs associated with accounts receivable sales programs whereby we sell our accounts receivable on a non recourse basis to financial institutions and million in stock option expense under sfas r 
these increased costs were partially offset by a million reduction in incentive compensation expense in the current year 

index as noted above  the company recorded a million charge in the second quarter of to write off goodwill of its swedish subsidiary 
interest expense  net  decreased to million in from million in due to lower overall borrowing levels as cash generated by operations was used to reduce debt levels 
our effective tax rate increased to in from in the increase is primarily the result of the million second quarter goodwill impairment charge which is not tax deductible and therefore had no income tax benefit associated with it 
in addition  our provision for income includes a million charge to write off deferred tax assets 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased to million in from million in revenues in were up primarily as a result of continued growth in new product sales 
an additional week s sales in and the june acquisition of hermoff accounted for approximately of the sales growth 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in to in the primary reasons for the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales were a continued mix shift toward lower margin automotive hard parts and a million increase in the provision for excess and slow moving inventory reserves in selling  general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million 
the expense increase was the result of inflationary cost increases  an increase in variable operating expenses due to sales volume growth and the company s decision to invest more resources in new product development which resulted in higher spending for product management  purchasing  engineering and quality control in during  the company also increased the use of its accounts receivable sale facilities 
financing costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable are recorded as operating expenses and amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense  net decreased to million in from million in due to lower overall borrowing rates in the primary reason for the lower borrowing rates was a reduction in the outstanding principal of the company s senior notes  which was replaced with revolving credit borrowings at a lower interest rate 
the company s effective tax rate increased to in from in due to the loss of certain state tax benefits in as a result of changes in state tax legislation and lower earnings from the company s swedish subsidiary where tax rates are lower than the statutory rate in the united states 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through a combination of cash flow from operations  accounts receivable sales programs provided by certain customers and through the issuance of senior indebtedness through our bank credit facility and senior note agreements 
at december   working capital was million  total long term debt including the current portion and revolving credit borrowings was million and shareholders equity was million 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  totaled million 
over the past several years we have extended payment terms to certain customers as a result of customer requests and market demands 
these extended terms have resulted in increased accounts receivable levels and significant uses of cash flow 
we participate in accounts receivable sales programs with several customers which allow us to sell our accounts receivable on a non recourse basis to financial institutions to offset the negative cash flow impact of these payment terms extensions 
as of december  and december   respectively  we had sold million and million in accounts receivable under these programs and had removed them from our balance sheets 
we expect continued pressure to extend our payment terms for the foreseeable future 
further extensions of customer payment terms will result in additional uses of cash flow or increased costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable 

index in july  we amended our revolving credit facility 
the amendment increased the size of the total credit facility from million to million and extended the expiration date from june to june borrowings under the facility are on an unsecured basis with interest at rates ranging from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points based upon the achievement of certain benchmarks related to the ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
the interest rate at december  was libor plus basis points 
borrowings under the facility were million as of december  we have approximately million available under the facility at december  the loan agreement also contains covenants  the most restrictive of which pertain to net worth and the ratio of debt to ebitda 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the notes and revolving credit facility at december  at december   long term debt includes million in senior notes that were originally issued in august  in a private placement on an unsecured basis notes 
the notes bear a fixed interest rate  payable quarterly 
annual principal payments of million are due in august and august the notes require  among other things  that we maintain certain financial covenants relating to debt to capital ratios and minimum net worth 
in september  we borrowed  under a commercial loan granted in connection with the opening of a new distribution facility 
the principal balance is paid monthly in equal installments through september the outstanding balance bears interest at an annual rate of payable monthly 
the loan is secured by a letter of credit issued under our revolving credit facility 
our business activities do not include the use of unconsolidated special purpose entities  and there are no significant business transactions that have not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
we have future obligations for debt repayments  future minimum rental and similar commitments under noncancellable operating leases as well as contingent obligations related to outstanding letters of credit 
these obligations in millions as of december  are summarized in the tables below payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term borrowings estimated interested payments operating leases these amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the underlying loan agreements 
payments related to variable debt are based on interest rates and outstanding balances as of december  the amounts do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt 
amount of commitment expiration per period total amount amounts less than other commercial commitments committed year years years over years letters of credit we reported a net source of cash flow from our operating activities of million in fiscal net income  depreciation and a million decrease in inventory were the primary sources of operating cash flow in inventory levels declined despite higher sales volumes as a result of our efforts to reduce vendor lead times and more accurately forecast customer demand for our products 
the primary use of cash flow was accounts receivable which increased million 
the increase is the result of a lengthening of payment terms to certain customers  higher sales levels and a million reduction in accounts receivable sold under accounts receivable sales programs with several customers 

index investing activities used million of cash in fiscal as a result of additions to property  plant and equipment 
our largest capital project was the automation and expansion of our central distribution center in warsaw  kentucky  which was completed in the third quarter of at a cost of approximately million  most of which was incurred in prior years 
capital spending in also included tooling associated with new products  purchases of equipment to outfit our new distribution center in portland  tennessee  upgrades to information systems  purchases of equipment designed to improve operational efficiencies and scheduled equipment replacements 
financing activities used million in fiscal the primary use of cash flow was a scheduled million repayment of our senior notes in august this repayment was partially funded with million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility with the rest coming from operating cash flow 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our available sources of capital under our revolving credit agreement  accounts receivable sales programs and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our ongoing cash needs for the next twelve months 
foreign currency fluctuations in  approximately of our products were purchased from a variety of foreign countries 
the products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the purchase price specified in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not have exposure to fluctuations in the relationship between the dollar and various foreign currencies between the time of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product 
however  weakness in the dollar has resulted in some materials price increases and pressure from several foreign suppliers to increase prices further 
to the extent that the dollar decreases in value to foreign currencies in the future or the present weakness in the dollar continues for a sustained period of time  the price of the product in dollars for new purchase orders may increase further 
the largest portion of our overseas purchases come from china 
the value of the chinese yuan has increased relative to the us dollar over since july when it was allowed to fluctuate against a basket of currencies 
most experts believe that the value of the yuan will increase further relative to the us dollar over the next few years 
such a move would most likely result in an increase in the cost of products that are purchased from china 
impact of inflation we have experienced increases in the cost of materials and transportation costs as a result of raw materials shortages and commodity price increases 
these increases did not have a material impact on us 
we believes that further cost increases could potentially be mitigated by passing along price increases to customers or through the use of alternative suppliers or resourcing purchases to other countries  however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts 
related party transactions we have a noncancelable operating lease for our primary operating facility from a partnership in which richard n 
berman  our chief executive officer  and steven l 
berman  our executive vice president  are partners 
total rental payments in to the partnership under the lease arrangement were million 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  customer credits  inventories  goodwill and income taxes 
estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be accurate and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
index allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a significant percentage of our accounts receivable have been  and will continue to be  concentrated among a relatively small number of automotive retailers and warehouse distributors in the united states 
our five largest customers accounted for and of net accounts receivable as of december  and december   respectively 
a bankruptcy or financial loss associated with a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
revenue recognition and allowance for customer credits 
revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
we record estimates for cash discounts  product returns and warranties  discounts and promotional rebates in the period of the sale customer credits 
the provision for customer credits is recorded as a reduction from gross sales and reserves for customer credits are shown as a reduction of accounts receivable 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
costs associated with shipping and handling are included in cost of goods sold 
actual customer credits have not differed materially from estimated amounts for each period presented 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
we must make estimates of potential future excess and obsolete inventory costs 
we provide reserves for discontinued and excess inventory based upon historical demand  forecasted usage  estimated customer requirements and product line updates 
we maintain contact with our customer base in order to understand buying patterns  customer preferences and the life cycle of our products 
changes in customer requirements are factored into the reserves as needed 
goodwill 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we employ a discounted cash flow analysis and a market comparable approach in conducting our impairment tests 
cash flows were discounted at and an earnings multiple of to times ebitda was used when conducting these tests in as a result of the impairment test  we wrote off all of the goodwill of our swedish subsidiary scan tech 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
income taxes 
we follow the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in the deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes takes into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset takes into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec office of the chief accountant and divisions of corporation finance and investment management released sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  that provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal year this pronouncement had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied prospectively and are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating what effect  if any  adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 

index in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation requires that the company recognize in the financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
the provisions of fin are effective beginning january  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we have performed a preliminary assessment of the impact of adopting fin  and do not believe that adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
with the exception of our revolving credit facility  long term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates and denominated in us dollars 
we manage our interest rate risk by monitoring trends in interest rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements 
under the terms of our revolving credit facility and customer sponsored programs to sell accounts receivable  a change in either the lender s base rate or libor would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds under the revolving credit facility 
we believe that the effect of any such change would be minimal
