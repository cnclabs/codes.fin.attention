the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview vivus  inc is a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of therapeutic products for large underserved markets using patented proprietary formulations and novel delivery systems and by seeking new indications for previously approved pharmaceutical products 
we have employed this strategy and  currently  we have development candidates addressing obesity  postmenopausal and sexual health 
all of these sectors are rapidly growing as patients seek more effective treatment options with fewer side effects 
with respect to obesity  analysts estimate that this potential market ranges from billion to billion annually 
the indications targeted by vivus postmenopausal and sexual health products each represent a projected market greater than billion annually 
we are currently advancing four late stage clinical products  each addressing specific components of these significant markets 
one of these products has completed phase testing and we submitted a new drug application nda to the us food and drug administration fda in the third quarter of the remaining products are being prepared to enter phase clinical trials 
in  we launched muse alprostadil in the united states and  together with our partners  internationally 
we market muse as a prescription product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
our investigational product pipeline includes qnexatm for treating obesity  for which a phase study has been completed  evamisttm to treat vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause  for which we submitted an nda to the fda in the third quarter of  testosterone mdts is being developed to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder  for which a phase study has been completed  and avanafil is being developed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction  for which phase studies have been completed 
our future our goal is to build a successful pharmaceutical company through the development and commercialization of innovative proprietary products for the treatment of obesity and sexual health 
we intend to achieve this by capitalizing on our clinical and regulatory expertise and experience to advance the development of product candidates in our pipeline  establishing strategic relationships with marketing partners to maximize sales potential for our products that require significant commercial support  and licensing complementary clinical stage products or technologies with competitive advantages from third parties for new and established markets 
it is our objective to become a leader in the development and commercialization of products that help to treat obesity and restore sexual health in women and men 
we believe that we have strong intellectual property supporting several opportunities in obesity treatment and sexual health 
our future growth will come from further development and regulatory approval of our product candidates as well as in licensing and product line extensions 
we have funded operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock and through product sales of muse 
we expect to generate future net losses due to increases in operating expenses as product candidates are advanced through the various stages of clinical development 
as of december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of million and expect to incur operating losses in the near future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  rebates and sales reserves  research and development expenses  doubtful accounts  income taxes  inventories  contingencies and litigation and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition product revenue product sales are recognized as revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales allowances and reserves revenues from product sales are recorded net of product sales allowances for expected returns of expired product  government chargebacks  other rebates  and cash discounts for prompt payment 
these sales allowances are deducted from gross product revenues at the time such revenues are recognized along with the recording of a corresponding reserve  or liability 
in making these estimates we take into consideration our historical information  current contractual and statutory requirements  shelf life of our products  estimated customer inventory levels and information received from outside parties 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating the reserve balances in any accounting period 
our product sales allowances and reserves include product returns we have estimated reserves for product returns from wholesalers  hospitals and pharmacies in the united states in accordance with our product returns policy 
our returns policy allows product returns within the period beginning six months prior to and twelve months following product expiration 
as of december  the shipments of muse in the united states made in  and a portion of the shipments in remain subject to future returns 
we record reserves for anticipated returns of expired product in the united states 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of product returns can be made based on historical experience 
there is no right of return on expired product sold internationally subsequent to shipment  thus  no returns reserve is needed 
we estimate our return reserve by utilizing historical information and data obtained from external sources  along with the shelf life of the product 
we track the actual returns on a lot by lot basis along with date of production and date of expiration 
we review the actual returns experience for trends 
we calculate our returns reserve by applying an estimated return rate to the quantity of units sold that are subject to future return 
we routinely assess our experience with product returns and adjust the reserves accordingly 
revisions in returns estimates are charged to income in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known 
government chargebacks government chargebacks are contractual commitments by us to provide muse to federal government organizations including the veterans administration at specified prices 
government chargeback allowances are recorded at the time of sale and accrued as a reserve 
in estimating the government chargeback reserve  we analyze actual chargeback amounts and apply chargeback rates to estimates of the quantity of units subject to chargeback 
we routinely reassess the chargeback estimates and adjust the reserves accordingly 
other rebates we estimate amounts payable by us for medicare part d rebates  medicaid rebates to states for goods purchased by patients covered by medicaid  and other rebate programs  primarily with managed care organizations  for the reimbursement of portions of the prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
rebate allowances are estimated and reserved at the time of sale 
we estimate this reserve by utilizing historical information  contractual and statutory requirements  estimated quantities sold to these organizations and estimated customer inventory levels 
effective january   muse no longer qualifies for medicaid reimbursement  which has not had a significant impact on our business 
effective january   muse will no longer qualify for medicare part d  which we do not believe will have a significant impact on our business 
cash discounts we offer cash discounts to wholesaler distributors  generally of the sales price as an incentive for prompt payment 
the estimate of cash discounts is recorded at the time of sale 
we account for the cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts we expect wholesaler distributors to take 
all of the aforementioned categories of sales allowances are evaluated each reporting period and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our sales allowance adjustments to fluctuate 
if actual returns  government chargebacks  medicare rebates  other rebates and cash discounts are greater than our estimates  additional reserves may be required which could have an adverse effect on financial results in the period of adjustment 
revisions to estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
other revenue revenue from non refundable  upfront license fees where we have continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the development or agreement period 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses include license fees  related compensation  contractor fees  facilities costs  administrative expenses and clinical trials at other companies and research institutions under agreements which are generally cancelable  among other related r d costs 
we also record accruals for estimated clinical study costs 
clinical study costs represent costs incurred by clinical research organizations  or cros  and clinical sites 
these costs are recorded as a component of r d expenses 
we analyze the progress of the clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our customers for product sales resulting in accounts receivable 
for qualified customers  we grant payment terms of  net days 
customer accounts are monitored for past due amounts 
past due accounts receivable  determined to be uncollectible  are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based upon past due amounts  historical losses and existing economic factors  and are adjusted periodically 
the accounts receivable are reported on the balance sheet  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for all periods presented  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
we have also recorded income taxes payable for estimated current tax liabilities 
we monitor these estimated liabilities and adjust them as conditions warrant 
inventories we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence  unmarketable or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in  we recorded a  inventory write down related to the purchase of alprostadil  considered to be in excess of projected production needs 
during the quarter ended september   we established significant reserves against our inventory to align with new estimates of expected future demand for muse 
as of december   the remaining inventory reserve balance is million relating to raw materials and components 
some portion of the fully reserved inventory was used in production in  and in the fourth quarter of  we stopped using the fully reserved raw materials inventory in production and determined that we would not likely use this inventory in future production 
in the first quarter of  we determined that we likely would continue to use some portion of the fully reserved component parts in production 
when we record inventory reserves  we establish a new  lower cost basis for the inventory for accounting purposes 
accordingly  to the extent that this fully reserved inventory was used in production in  and  it was charged to cost of goods sold at a zero basis  which had a favorable impact on cost of goods sold 
available for sale securities available for sale securities represent investments in debt securities that are stated at fair value 
we restrict our cash investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate securities  including commercial paper  rated a p f or better 
the difference between amortized cost cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts which are recognized as adjustments to interest income and fair value  representing unrealized holding gains or losses  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
our policy is to record investments in debt securities as available for sale because the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity 
any gains and losses on the sale of debt securities are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
available for sale securities with original maturities beyond one year from the balance sheet date are classified as non current 
contingencies and litigation we are periodically involved in disputes and litigation related to a variety of matters 
when it is probable that we will experience a loss  and that loss is quantifiable  we record appropriate reserves 
share based payments we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our stock option plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six month offering period under our employee stock purchase plans 
in the third quarter of  we added the ability to issue restricted stock units to our plan 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas r  share based payment 
effective january   we use the fair value method to apply the provisions of sfas r with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
under the modified prospective application  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
on november   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
sfas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in this fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  which is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r prior to the adoption of sfas r  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we applied the existing accounting rules under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb which provided that no compensation expense was charged for options granted at an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
at december   a total of  stock options were outstanding under our stock option plans 
stock based compensation expense recognized for the year ended december  included compensation expense for stock options granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas included in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million related to stock options   related to the employee stock purchase plan  and  related to restricted stock units  net of the estimated forfeitures 
as of december   unrecognized estimated compensation expense totaled million related to non vested stock options   related to the employee stock purchase plan  and  related to restricted stock units 
the weighted average remaining requisite service period of the non vested options was years  of the employee stock purchase plan was months  and of the restricted stock units was years 
valuation assumptions the fair value of stock options granted in the year ended december  was estimated using a black scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions twelve months ended december  expected term in years volatility risk free interest rate dividend yield expected term vivus expected term represents the period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified method provided in staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which averages an award s weighted average vesting period and expected term for plain vanilla share options 
under sab  options are considered to be plain vanilla if they have the following basic characteristics granted at the money  exerciseability is conditioned upon service through the vesting date  termination of service prior to vesting results in forfeiture  limited exercise period following termination of service  and options are non transferable and non hedgeable 
the range of expected terms used in the black scholes model in was years to years 
expected volatility we estimated volatility using the historical share price performance over the expected term of the option 
we also considered other factors such as our current clinical trials and other company activities that may affect volatility of our stock in the future but determined that at this time  the historical volatility was more indicative of our expected future stock performance 
the range of expected volatility used in the black scholes model in was to expected dividend the black scholes model requires a single expected dividend yield as an input 
we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future 
risk free interest rate we base the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes model on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term  in effect during the period of the grant 
the range of risk free interest rates used in the black scholes model in was to 
estimated pre vesting forfeitures we develop pre vesting forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data 
the fair value of employee stock purchases made under the espp in the year ended december  was also estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the following assumptions were used expected term ranging from 
years to 
years  expected volatility ranging from to  no dividend yield and risk free rates ranging from to 
the weighted average assumptions used in were expected term of 
years  expected volatility of  no dividend yield and a risk free rate of 
during the third quarter of  we granted  restricted stock units to an officer with a weighted average grant date fair value of per restricted stock unit 
this grant contains a market condition and was valued using a binomial model 
the following assumptions were used for valuing this grant no dividend yield  expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of and an expected term of years 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with sfas r and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
estimates of share based compensation expenses are significant to our financial statements  but these expenses are based on option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
for this reason  and because we do not view share based compensation as related to our operational performance  we exclude estimated share based compensation expense when evaluating our business performance 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new  and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
theoretical valuation models and market based methods are evolving and may result in lower or higher fair value estimates for share based compensation 
the timing  readiness  adoption  general acceptance  reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain 
sophisticated mathematical models may require voluminous historical information  modeling expertise  financial analyses  correlation analyses  integrated software and databases  consulting fees  customization and testing for adequacy of internal controls 
market based methods are emerging that  if employed by us  may dilute our earnings per share and involve significant transaction fees and ongoing administrative expenses 
the uncertainties and costs of these extensive valuation efforts may outweigh the benefits to investors 
results of operations executive overview for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or net loss per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or net loss per share  during the same period in the decreased net loss in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to higher domestic product revenue and decreased clinical activities related to vivus four clinical development programs for sexual health  partially offset by increased spending related to the qnexa program 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or net loss per share as compared to a net loss of million  or net loss per share  during the same period in the increased net loss in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to lower product revenues both in the united states and internationally  partially offset by lower research and development costs in as compared to effective january  vivus implemented sfas r  which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
stock compensation expense under sfas r is million for the year ended december  this amount has been allocated to cost of goods sold and manufacturing  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses  accordingly 
there were no comparable stock compensation charges in the years ended december  or we anticipate continued losses over the next several years because we expect muse sales to remain steady  and we plan to continue to invest in clinical development of our current research and development product candidates to bring those potential products to market 
revenue years ended december  change increase decrease vs vs in thousands  except percentages united states product  net international product other revenue total revenues worldwide product revenues from the sales of muse were million in  an increase of million  or  from the worldwide sales of muse in product revenue in the united states for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in the increase in revenues in is mainly due to increases in both domestic prices and volume  partially offset by the timing of orders from our international distributors 
domestic demand for muse at the retail and government level remains consistent with the prior period  averaging approximately  units per quarter 
similar to prior years  wholesalers made purchases in the fourth quarter of that were greater than the current demand 
based on the fourth quarter demand for muse  we estimate purchases made by wholesalers in the fourth quarter of represent approximately to months of excess demand 
the increase in other revenue is primarily due to the amortization of a million milestone payment from our european distributor  meda ab that we received in the first quarter of worldwide product revenues from the sales of muse were million in  a decrease of million  or  from the worldwide sales of muse in product revenue in the united states for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  international product revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million in the same period in domestic sales of muse were lower in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   mainly due to a decline in the demand for muse  decreased purchases made by wholesalers in advance of the december price increase as compared to purchases in advance of the december price increase  and new us government pricing which resulted in higher chargebacks 
similar to prior years  wholesalers made purchases in the fourth quarter that were greater than demand 
international revenue also decreased as a result of lower shipments of muse to our international distribution partners in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  however  of the shipments made in to our international partners took place in the fourth quarter of given the stabilization of demand and the strategic buying in the fourth quarter of  we anticipate worldwide revenues of muse in will remain consistent with those seen in cost of goods sold and manufacturing 
years ended december  change increase decrease vs vs in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold and manufacturing cost of goods sold and manufacturing cost of goods sold in the year ended december  increased  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of goods sold and manufacturing expense is the result of a  inventory write down related to the purchase of alprostadil in excess of projected production needs   of stock compensation expense from the adoption of sfas r  partially offset by other cost of goods sold and manufacturing expense net decreases of  in the year ended december  as a result of excess manufacturing capacity at our new jersey facility  we expensed approximately million in manufacturing overhead costs expensed as period costs in the year ended december   as compared to million the prior year 
this accounting treatment is based on the determination made during the restructuring that the manufacturing capacity of the new jersey plant far exceeds the level of production required to meet estimated future market demand 
cost of goods sold and manufacturing cost of goods sold in the year ended december  decreased  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  we expensed approximately million of manufacturing overhead costs in the year ended december   as compared to million during the same period in as period costs because of excess manufacturing capacity at our new jersey facility 
in accordance with gaap  in we reduced the carrying cost of alprostadil  the active ingredient in muse  and its component parts to zero due to excess quantities on hand at that time 
although the cost basis for alprostadil was reduced to zero  we continued to use this active ingredient as allowed by the fda in the production of muse in by utilizing the inventory that had previously been written down to zero  we lowered our cost of sales for the year ended december  by  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that we would likely not use the fully reserved raw materials inventory in future production 
in the years ended december  and  we used component parts of this fully reserved inventory resulting in a favorable impact on our cost of goods sold of  and  respectively 
we anticipate that cost of goods sold in will remain consistent with costs 
research and development 
years ended december  change increase decrease vs vs in thousands  except percentages research and development research and development expenses in the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  decreased clinical trial and project activity for evamist  avanafil  and alista resulted in decreased spending for these projects of million in as compared to these decreases were partially offset by increased qnexa project expenses of million  the recording of  of stock compensation expense and an incremental increase in other research and development related spending in as compared to the prior year 
research and development expenses in the year ended december  were million  as compared to million in the year ended december  increased clinical trial and project activity for alista and evamist resulted in incremental spending for these projects of million in the year ended december   as compared to the same period last year 
this increase was more than offset by a decrease of million in avanafil  testosterone mdts and other related clinical trial and project spending  a decrease of million in non project related research and development expenses  primarily lower compensation expense due to reduced headcount  and million in milestone and licensing fees which were incurred in during  we entered into exclusive licensing agreements with a subsidiary of acrux under which we will develop and  if approved  commercialize  in the united states  an estradiol spray now known as evamist for the alleviation of the symptoms of menopause and a testosterone spray for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women 
during the year ended december   we expensed a total of million of licensing fees incurred under the terms of the agreements 
in addition  during the year ended december   we initiated a phase clinical trial with avanafil  which we completed in under the terms of our development  licensing and supply agreement with tanabe  we expensed a million licensing fee obligation to tanabe in the year ended december  we paid the entire obligation to tanabe  totaling million with imputed interest  in march we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase significantly in  as we continue to advance the clinical program for qnexa for the treatment of obesity and our other programs 
our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical and preclinical studies 
based upon results of our phase b study  alista will receive a lower development priority than the other investigational product candidates in our pipeline 
if we are successful in obtaining fda regulatory approval for any new product candidates being developed through our research and development efforts  we do not expect to recognize revenue from sales of any such new products  if any  for several years 
we filed a new drug application nda for evamist with the fda in the third quarter of and made a million clinical development milestone payment to acrux under the terms of our licensing agreement in october related to this filing  which was expensed in the third quarter of upon approval of the nda  a million product approval milestone payment will be due to acrux 
selling  general and administrative 
years ended december  change increase vs vs in thousands  except percentages selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  of million increased million  or as compared to the year ended december  in the year ended december   the increase is primarily due to recording of million in stock compensation expense  and incremental net increases in muse related sales and marketing expenses of million and legal fees of  as compared to the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  of million were  higher than the same period last year due to several factors 
in the first quarter of  two of our largest wholesalers commenced charging us a distribution service fee based upon either the quantity of product purchased or sold by the respective wholesaler 
we recorded expense of  for this distribution service fee in the year ended december  to selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  we recorded  of incremental accounting and audit fees expense and  in other professional consulting fees in the year ended december  primarily related to compliance with the requirements of sarbanes oxley 
these increases were partially offset by a  reduction in muse advertising and promotion related expenses in the twelve months ended december  as compared to we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses in will be similar to interest income and expense 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in is primarily due to an increase in our cash balances due to increased financing in and related investment yields from the year ended december  to december  interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  during the same period in the increased interest expense is primarily due to the crown bank loan  which was obtained on january   and a higher loan balance outstanding for the tanabe loan 
interest income for was million  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in our cash balances and related investment yields from the year ended december  to december  interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  during the same period in this interest expense is related to the acrux milestone liabilities and tanabe license fees and loan 
the increased interest expense is primarily due to a higher loan balance outstanding for the tanabe loan 
liquidity and capital resources cash 
unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million is the result of the million in net proceeds from our registered direct public offerings in  the million loan obtained from crown bank  na in  the collection of amounts owed at december  from customers as measured by a decrease of million in accounts receivable partially offset by cash used in operations  investment and other financing activities of million for the year 
since inception  we have financed operations primarily from the issuance of equity securities and revenues 
through december   we raised million from financing activities and had an accumulated deficit of million at december  available for sale securities 
we focus on liquidity and capital preservation in our investments in available for sale securities 
we restrict our cash investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate securities  including commercial paper  rated a p f or better 
the weighted average maturity of our portfolio is not to exceed months 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was million  as compared to million at december  the decrease in the accounts receivable balance at december  is primarily due to a million decrease in sales in december  as compared to the same period in currently  we do not have any significant concerns related to accounts receivable or collections 
as of february   we had collected of the december  accounts receivable 
liabilities 
total liabilities were million at december   million higher than at december  the change in total liabilities is primarily due to the million loan received from crown bank on january   and receipt of the million meda milestone payment  recorded as deferred revenue in the first quarter of these increases were partially offset by the reduction of liabilities  including a million reduction in accrued research  clinical and licensing fees  primarily due to the payment of accrued licensing fees to tanabe of million in  and a million reduction in accounts payable  due to the timing of payments 
we have entered into manufacturing agreements with suppliers to purchase raw materials 
as of december   our remaining commitment under these agreements is to purchase a minimum of million of product from through in  we recorded a  inventory write down related to the purchase of alprostadil considered to be in excess of projected production needs 
should our inventory of raw materials exceed our future production needs  it may be necessary to write off additional excess inventory 
in february  we entered into exclusive licensing agreements with acrux limited and a subsidiary of acrux under which we have agreed to develop and  if approved  commercialize testosterone mdts metered dose transdermal spray and evamist in the united states for various female health applications

operating activities 
our operating activities used million and million of cash during the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   our net operating loss of million was partially offset by a million reduction in our accounts receivable  due to the collection of monies owed to us  and the recording of million in non cash stock based compensation expense  due to the adoption of fas r in these operating cash flow sources were offset by a million reduction in accrued research  clinical and licensing fees  primarily due to the payment of accrued licensing fees to tanabe of million in investing activities 
our investing activities used million and provided million in cash during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fluctuations from period to period are due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales and maturity of investment securities and the purchase of land and buildings for million offset by the release of restricted cash of million in in addition  during the first quarter of  we provided crown bank with a  certificate of deposit as collateral for the loan agreement we entered into with them on january  financing activities 
financing activities provided cash of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the million net proceeds from the registered direct sales of  shares of common stock on may  at a price of per share   shares of common stock on november  at a price of per share  and  shares of common stock on december  at a price of per share  in addition to the million net proceeds from the crown bank loan we entered into on january  in both and  these amounts also include borrowings under our tanabe line of credit  proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and employee stock purchase plan espp purchases

on january   we obtained a million loan from crown bank  na crown 
the land and buildings  among other assets  located at our principal manufacturing facility and a  certificate of deposit held by crown serve as collateral for these agreements 
the loan is payable over a year term and the interest rate will be fixed at  which is the prime rate plus at the time of funding and then will be adjusted annually to a fixed rate for the year equal to the prime rate plus with a floor of 
on december   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec  which allowed us to offer and sell up to an aggregate of million of common stock from time to time in one or more offerings 
the terms of any such future offering would be established at the time of such offering 
on february   we filed a prospectus supplement with the sec relating to an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock under the existing shelf registration statement and supplement thereto 
on march   we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  providing us with net proceeds of million 
on may   we sold million of our common stock in a registered direct offering 
under the terms of the financing  we sold  shares of vivus common stock at a price of per share to two institutional investors 
on may   we filed a prospectus supplement with the sec relating to this registered direct offering under the existing shelf registration statement on form s and supplement thereto 
on july   vivus  inc filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s the shelf registration statement file number was declared effective by the sec on august   providing us with the ability to offer and sell up to an aggregate of million of common stock from time to time in one or more offerings 
the terms of any such future offering would be established at the time of such offering 
this shelf registration statement file number replaces shelf registration statement file number 
on november   we raised million in a registered direct offering of our common stock pursuant to this shelf registration statement 
under the terms of this financing  we sold and issued a total of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in an initial closing and an additional  shares in a second closing on december  all of the shares of common stock were offered pursuant to an effective registration statement on form s filed with the sec on july  the funding necessary to execute our business strategies is subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
it is also important to note that if a clinical candidate is identified  the further development of that candidate can be halted or abandoned at any time due to a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  funding constraints  lack of efficacy or safety or change in market demand 
the nature and efforts required to develop our product candidates into commercially viable products include research to identify a clinical candidate  preclinical development  clinical testing  fda approval and commercialization 
this process is very costly and can take in excess of years to complete for each product candidate 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical studies  including  among others  the following we or the fda may suspend trials  we may discover that a product candidate may cause harmful side effects or is not effective  patient recruitment may be slower than expected  and patients may drop out of the trials 
for each of our programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and the merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
as such  the ultimate timeline and costs to commercialize a product cannot be accurately estimated 
our product candidates have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later clinical trials 
it is possible for a candidate to show promising results in clinical trials  but subsequently fail to establish safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
we may also be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other areas of our business 
in particular our future capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress and costs of our research and development programs  the scope  timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  patient recruitment and enrollment in current and future clinical trials  the costs involved in seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates  the costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications and enforcing patent claims  the establishment of collaborations and strategic alliances  the cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities and arrangements  the results of operations  demand for muse  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the rate of technological advances  ongoing determinations of the potential commercial success of our products under development  the level of resources devoted to sales and marketing capabilities  and the activities of competitors 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources combined with anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating needs into however  we anticipate that we will require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs  to conduct preclinical studies and trials  for operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending our patent claims  if any  and we may require additional funding to establish additional manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the future 
in particular  we expect to make other substantial payments to acrux and tanabe in accordance with our agreements with them in connection with the licensing of certain compounds 
these payments are based on certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  we are required to make royalty payments on any future product sales 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances and other financing mechanisms 
we cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our research or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others 
this may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates 
to the extent that we are unable to obtain third party funding for such expenses  we expect that increased expenses will result in increased losses from operations 
we are continually evaluating our existing portfolio and we may choose to divest or spin off one or more of our products or product candidates at any time 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop our products under development or that our products  if successfully developed  will generate revenues sufficient to enable us to earn a profit 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years

the land and buildings  among other assets  located at our principal manufacturing facility and a  certificate of deposit held by crown serve as collateral for these agreements 
the loan is payable over a year term and the interest rate will be fixed at  which is the prime rate plus at the time of funding and then will be adjusted annually to a fixed rate for the year equal to the prime rate plus with a floor of 
as of december   we have a principal balance of million remaining on the crown loan 
additional payments we have entered into development  license and supply agreements which contain provisions for payments upon completion of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
due to the uncertainty concerning when and if these milestones may be completed  we have not included these potential future obligations in the above table 
tanabe in january  we entered into an exclusive development  license and supply agreement with tanabe for the development and commercialization of avanafil  a pde inhibitor compound for the oral and local treatment of male and female sexual dysfunction 
under the terms of the agreement  tanabe agreed to grant an exclusive license to us for products containing avanafil outside of japan  north korea  south korea  china  taiwan  singapore  indonesia  malaysia  thailand  vietnam and the philippines 
we agreed to grant tanabe an exclusive  royalty free license within those countries for oral products that we develop containing avanafil 
in addition  we agreed to grant tanabe an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive  royalty bearing license within those countries for non oral products that we develop containing avanafil 
further  we granted tanabe the option to obtain co promotional rights for oral products that we develop under our license for up to of the promotional activity in our territory 
tanabe agreed to manufacture and supply us with avanafil for use in clinical trials  which will be our primary responsibility 
we have paid upfront licensing fees of million to tanabe and have agreed to make additional payments upon the completion of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
during the first quarter of  we initiated a phase clinical trial with avanafil  which meets one of the clinical development milestone criteria above 
we paid tanabe million in connection with this milestone in we have further agreed to pay royalties on net sales of products containing avanafil 
acrux in february  we entered into exclusive licensing agreements with acrux limited acrux and its subsidiary under which we have agreed to develop and  if approved  commercialize testosterone mdts and evamist in the united states for various female health applications 
acrux s metered dose transdermal spray  or mdts  technology is a patented  simple to use spray that is being developed to deliver testosterone and estradiol effectively to women when applied to the skin 
we agreed to grant acrux s subsidiary a non exclusive  royalty free license outside the united states for any mdts products containing improvements we have made to the licensed intellectual property and the option to obtain a non exclusive  worldwide license for our intellectual property related to mdts products 
we have paid million in upfront licensing fees to acrux and have agreed to make additional payments upon the completion of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
under the terms of the agreements  we agreed to pay to acrux combined licensing fees up to million for the achievement of certain clinical development milestones  up to million for achieving product approval milestones  and royalties on net sales in the united states following approval and commercialization of each product 
we have paid million in clinical development milestones payments to date  including the million milestone payment we made to acrux in october related to the submission of an nda to the fda for evamist

off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and have not established any special purpose entities 
we have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non financial assets 
indemnifications in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
to the extent permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement provides entities the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the effect  if any  that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement rollover and balance sheet iron curtain approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
if prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial now are considered material based on either approach  no restatement is required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered 
if prior years are not restated  the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening accumulated earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions  including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions

fin also provides guidance on derecognizing  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or deficit at january  we are in the process of evaluating the effect that the adoption of this interpretation will have on our results of operations and financial condition and we are not yet in a position to determine such effects

 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement is meant to eliminate any differences existing between the fasb standards and the standards issued by the international accounting standards board by clarifying that any abnormal idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage be recognized as current period charges 
the adoption of this statement by vivus in the first quarter of did not have a material impact on results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as we had previously expensed a portion of our manufacturing overhead as period cost due to excess capacity 
dividend policy we have not paid any dividends since its inception and do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
declaration or payment of future dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  operating results and current and anticipated cash needs 
cautionary note on forward looking statements our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the risks inherent in our research and development activities  including the successful completion of clinical trials  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain process of seeking regulatory approvals  uncertainties associated both with the potential infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties  and with obtaining and enforcing our own patents and patent rights  uncertainties regarding government reforms and of product pricing and reimbursement levels  technological change  competition  manufacturing uncertainties and dependence on third parties 
even if our product candidates appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for numerous reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that the product will be ineffective or unsafe during clinical trials  will fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  will be uneconomical to market or will be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties 
for more information about the risks we face  see item a risk factors included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify potential material losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our short term investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality government and other debt securities 
to minimize our exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and ensure that the maximum weighted average of our maturity of our investments does not exceed months 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date 
due to the short holding period of our investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material financial market risk exposure 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on the million loan from crown bank  na obtained on january  the loan is payable over a year term and the interest rate will be fixed at  which is the prime rate plus at the time of funding and then will be adjusted annually to a fixed rate for the year equal to the prime rate plus with a floor of
