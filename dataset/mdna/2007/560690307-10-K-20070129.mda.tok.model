this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a provider of interactive entertainment products 
we sell our products primarily to large retail chains  specialty retail stores  video game rental outlets and distributors 
we also sell our products internationally through distribution agreements with international publishers 
we have developed our retail and distribution network relationships over our year history 
we publish video game software for most major interactive entertainment hardware platforms  including nintendo s game boy advance  or gba  ds  micro  gamecube  and wii  sony s playstation  or ps  and playstation portable  or psp  microsoft s xbox and xbox and the personal computer  or pc 
our video game titles are targeted at various demographics at a range of price points  from lower priced value titles to more expensive premium titles 
in some instances  these titles are based on licenses of well known properties  and in other cases based on original properties 
we collaborate and enter into agreements with content providers and video game development studios for the creation of our video games 
majesco sales inc was incorporated in under the laws of the state of new jersey 
on december   majesco sales inc completed a reverse merger with majesco holdings inc formerly  connectivcorp then a publicly traded company with no active operations 
majesco holding inc was incorporated in under the laws of the state of delaware 
as a result of the merger  majesco sales inc became a wholly owned subsidiary and the sole operating business of the public company 
on april   majesco sales inc was merged into majesco holdings inc  and in connection with the merger majesco holdings inc 
changed its name to majesco entertainment company 
throughout most of our history we focused on value priced games 
during and we began to grow our presence in the premium console games market 
premium console products generally require larger budgets for development and marketing and required higher unit sales to 
table of contents generate a profit 
sales volumes achieved on several of our premium games introduced during this period were not significant enough to recover development  royalty and marketing costs required to publish the games 
during the second half of fiscal  we had several major developments that ultimately led us to revise our business model and shift our product strategy away from capital intensive premium console games to a focus on lower cost games for both console and handheld systems 
we also either sold the rights to  or cancelled several premium games in development in connection with this change in strategy 
we believe this strategy will allow us to capitalize on our strengths and expertise while reducing some of the cost and risk associated with publishing a large number of premium console titles 
we continue to publish titles for popular handheld systems such as the gba  ds and psp 
we also intend to publish software for nintendo s wii console released in november as we believe this platform allows us to develop games within our cost parameters  while enabling us to reach the mass market consumer 
in addition  we will continue to opportunistically look for titles to publish on the pc and other home console systems 
we also expanded distribution through our european subsidiary in fiscal in prior years sales were not significant in europe 
net sales in europe were million or of net sales for the year ended october  we incurred a net loss of million in and a net loss of million in historically  we have funded our operating losses through sales of our equity and use of our purchase order financing and factor arrangements 
while our current plan is to fund our operations through product sales in  we may be required to modify that plan  or seek outside sources of financing if our operating and sales targets are not met 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
while management has already significantly reduced expenditure levels  in the event that we are unable to negotiate alternative financing  or negotiate terms that are acceptable to us  we may be forced to further materially modify our business plan  including making further reductions in expenditures 
management believes it can operate under the existing level of financing for at least one year 
however  if the current level of financing was reduced and the company was unable to obtain alternative financing  it could create a material adverse change in the business 
net revenues 
our revenues are derived from the following types of offerings

games 
our video games consist of premium titles and value titles for console and handheld video game systems 
premium titles are higher priced video games that typically involve greater development and marketing costs 
we work with third party development studios to develop our own proprietary titles and we also license rights to well known properties from third parties 
value titles are typically sold at suggested retail prices below and typically involve comparatively lower development and marketing costs than our premium titles  and

other digital entertainment products 
our gba video titles utilize compression technology that enables users to view up to minutes of color video content with stereo audio on their gba or ds  using a standard gba cartridge and with no additional hardware required 
we enter into licensing agreements with entertainment industry leaders for gba video content 
in addition  we develop  manufacture and market a variety of digital media peripherals and applications including a stand alone tv arcade plug and play video game system which consists of a firmware enabled joystick that connects directly to a user s television and plays pre installed video games without the need for a dedicated console 
our revenues are recognized net of reserves for price protection and other allowances 
see critical accounting policies below 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of product costs and amortization of software development costs and license fees 
a significant component of our cost of sales is product costs 
these are comprised primarily of manufacturing and packaging costs of the disc or cartridge media  royalties to 
table of contents the platform manufacturer and manufacturing and packaging costs of peripherals 
commencing upon the related product s release  capitalized software development and intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales 
gross profit 
gross profit is the excess of net revenues over product costs and amortization of software development and license fees 
our gross profit is directly affected by the mix of revenues from our premium and value titles 
the excess of net revenues over product costs has the potential to be substantially higher from publishing premium titles given the relatively similar manufacturing costs and higher sales prices 
however  development and license fees incurred to produce premium games are generally incurred up front and amortized to cost of sales 
the recovery of these costs and total gross profit is dependent upon achieving a certain sales volume  which varies by title 
our value titles are generally characterized as having lower gross profit margin potential than premium titles as a result of their lower sales price  and lower financial risk associated with the recovery of upfront development and license fees associated with premium game titles 
product research and development expenses 
product research and development expenses relate principally to our cost of supervision of the third party developers of our video games and other products  testing new products and conducting quality evaluations during the development cycle 
costs incurred are employee related  may include equipment and are not allocated to cost of sales 
although there can be no assurance  we anticipate that  with our focus now on low cost handheld game and value products  expenditures for product research and development will decrease as a percentage of net sales from historical levels 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist of marketing and promotion expenses  the cost of shipping products to customers and related employee costs 
a large component of this expense relates to marketing and promotion expenses  which includes certain customer marketing allowances 
we anticipate that our focus now on low cost handheld games and value products will result in decreased sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales from historical levels 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily represent employee related costs  including corporate executive and support staff  general office expenses  professional fees and various other overhead charges 
professional fees  including legal and accounting expenses  typically represent the second largest component of our general and administrative expenses 
these fees are partially attributable to our required activities as a publicly traded company  such as sec filings 
we expect to continue to incur increased costs related to the currently pending shareholder lawsuits  as well as for consultants in connection with our required compliance with recently enacted regulations regarding corporate governance and accounting 
under our revised business plan we expect a decrease in certain general and administrative expenses as a result of decreased headcount and related expenses 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs are directly attributable to our factoring and our inventory financing arrangements 
benefit provision for income taxes 
for the year ended  we incurred a loss and recognized the availability for income tax purposes of a carryback of such losses to the prior year 
utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
since the company has a history of losses  a full valuation allowance has been established under the provisions of sfas no 
and the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance for its net operating loss carryforwards until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

table of contents the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of its product when title and risk of loss are transferred  and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
in order to recognize revenue  the company must not have any continuing obligations and it must also be probable that the company will collect the accounts receivable 
revenues  including sales to resellers and distributors  are recognized when these conditions are met 
for those agreements  which provide customers with the right to multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed minimum royalty amounts  revenue is recognized at delivery of the product master or the first copy since the company has no continuing obligations including requirements for duplication 
royalties on sales that exceed the guaranteed minimum are recognized as earned 
the company generally sells its products on a no return basis  although in certain instances  the company may provide price protection or other allowances on certain unsold products 
price protection  when granted and applicable  allows customers a partial credit against amounts they owe the company with respect to merchandise unsold by them 
revenue is recognized net of estimates of these allowances 
inventory 
inventory  which consists primarily of finished goods  is stated at the lower of cost as determined by the first in  first out method  or market 
the company estimates the net realizable value of slow moving inventory on a title by title basis and charges the excess of cost over net realizable value to cost of sales 
reserves for price protection and other allowances 
we derive revenue from the sale of packaged video game software designed for play on consoles such as playstation  xbox and gamecube  and hand held game devices  including the gba  ds and psp 
we generally sell our products on a no return basis  although in certain instances  we may provide price protection or other allowances on certain unsold products in accordance with industry practices 
price protection  when granted and applicable  allows customers a partial credit with respect to merchandise unsold by them 
revenue is recognized net of estimates of these allowances 
sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received  such as the appearance of our products in a customer s national circular advertisement  are reflected as selling and marketing expenses 
we estimate potential future product price protection and other discounts related to current period product revenue 
generally price protection for premium priced titles is higher than that needed for our value titles 
our reserves for price protection and other allowances fluctuate over periods as a result of a number of factors including analysis of historical experience  current sell through of retailer inventory of our products  current trends in the interactive entertainment market  the overall economy  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors 
however  actual allowances granted could materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of requests for allowances may increase as consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these 
table of contents estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  this will result in a change in our reserves  which would impact the net revenues and or selling and marketing expenses we report 
for the year ended october   and  we provided allowances for future price protection and other allowances of million  million and million respectively 
the fluctuations in the provisions reflected our estimates of future price protection based on the factors discussed above 
we do not have significant exposure to credit risk as the factor generally buys our receivables without recourse  however  for the year ended october   we recorded charges for an accounts receivable write off of  as a result of a customer bankruptcy 
software development costs and prepaid license fees 
software development costs include development fees  most often in the form of milestone payments made to independent software developers for development services 
software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and it is determined that such costs should be recoverable against future revenues 
for products where proven game engine technology exists  this may occur early in the development cycle 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 
amounts related to software development that are not capitalized are charged immediately to product research and development costs 
prepaid license fees represent license fees to holders for the use of their intellectual property rights in the development of our products 
minimum guaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property licenses are initially recorded as an asset prepaid license fees and a current liability accrued royalties payable at the contractual amount upon execution of the contract when no significant performance remains with the licensor 
capitalized software development costs classified as non current relate to titles for which we estimate the release date to be more than one year from the balance sheet date 
commencing upon a related product s release  capitalized software development costs and prepaid license fees are amortized to cost of sales based upon the higher of i the ratio of current revenue to total projected revenue or ii the straight line method 
the amortization period is usually no longer than one year from the initial release of the product 
the recoverability of capitalized software development costs and prepaid license fees is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate 
the following criteria are used to evaluate expected product performance historical performance of comparable products using comparable technology  orders for the product prior to its release  and estimated performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based 
as of october  and  we charged operations million and million  respectively  to write off all capitalized costs related to video games and intellectual property rights for which development was stopped 
we also charged million to cost of sales  in  to recognize impairments in the carrying value for games already released by october accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
we adopted sfas r on november  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method 
we have decided to use the modified prospective transition method  which require that compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date as well as for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested as of the effective date

net revenues for the year ended october  increased to million from million in the comparable period last year 
the million increase is primarily due to increased international sales and a lower provision for price protection and other allowances on domestic sales 
the lower provision for price protection and other allowances is the result of a higher sell through percentage at retailers for titles released during the year ended october  this is reflective of our change in strategy of selling fewer premium games 
gross loss profit 
gross profit for the year ended october  was million compared to a gross loss of million in the prior year 
the increase of million is primarily due to a million charge to cost of sales during the year ended october  to recognize impairments in the carrying value of games for which orders received were significantly below expectations  a decrease in provisions for price protection and other allowances  and increased sales in europe

operating loss income 
for  the operating loss was million versus operating income of million in the prior year 
the decrease in operating income was principally due to lower sales volumes  increased allowances for price protection and higher marketing costs related to our premium game releases which were not recovered as a result of weaker than planned sales of those products

for the year ended october   we generated a net loss of million versus a net loss of million in the increase in net loss is attributable to weak sales across all of our product lines  primarily our premium game releases  which resulted in significant reserves relating to capitalized costs  increased provisions in price protection and other allowances 
the net loss attributable to common stockholders for of million includes a million charge related to warrants exercised at a reduced price as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders for of million 
liquidity and capital resources we incurred a net loss of million in and a net loss of million in historically  we have funded our operating losses through sales of our equity and use of our purchase order financing and factor arrangements 
in addition  as a result of a series of transactions during fiscal and related to  a private placement and secondary public offering  in which we sold equity securities including issuances upon the exercise of warrants  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
these proceeds were used to fund the operating loss  to fund the development of video games and the acquisition of intellectual property rights  to reduce indebtedness  and to satisfy certain settlements 
while our current plan is to fund our operations through product sales in  we may be required to modify that plan  or seek outside sources of financing if our operating and sales targets are not met 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
while management has already significantly reduced expenditure levels  in the event that we are unable to negotiate alternative financing  or negotiate terms that are acceptable to us  we may be forced to further materially modify our business plan  including making further reductions in expenditures 
management believes it can operate under the existing level of financing for at least one year 
however  if the current level of financing was reduced and the company was unable to obtain alternative financing  it could create a material adverse change in the business 
during the second half of fiscal  we had several major developments that ultimately led us to revise our business model and shift our product strategy away from capital intensive premium console games to a focus on value products and lower cost games for handheld systems 
in conjunction with our shift in strategy  we evaluated our existing portfolio of premium console titles in development and decided to sell our rights or cancel a number of these titles 
while this resulted in decreased revenues from premium game titles  these actions improved the financial position of the company by significantly reducing our future obligations and in some instances generating cash 
going forward  we will continue to publish titles for popular handheld systems such as the gba  ds and psp  as well as look for opportunistic titles that fit our business model for home consoles such as the wii and personal computers 
in addition  we will look to offer a greater number of value titles and try to capitalize on our history and expertise in this market 
we believe that a decreased emphasis on premium console titles  along with a renewed focus on value and handheld titles  will allow us to capitalize on our strengths and expertise 
although there can be no assurance  we expect this model will lessen the level of required working capital to support the plan 
while our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of october   we expect continued volatility in the use and availability of cash due to the seasonality of our business  timing of 
table of contents receivables collections and working capital needs necessary to finance our business and growth objectives 
to satisfy our liquidity needs  we factor our receivables 
we also utilize purchase order financing through the factor and through a finance company to provide funding for the manufacture of our products 
in connection with these arrangements  the finance company and the factor have a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
in october  our factor agreed to provide availability of up to million in cash advances including million for letters of credit and the factor also waived our covenant requirements 
the factor  in his sole discretion  can reduce the availability of financing at anytime 
in addition we have million of availability for letters of credit and purchase order financing with another lender 
factoring and purchase order financing 
as mentioned above  to provide liquidity  we take advances from our factor and utilized purchase order financing to fund the manufacturing of our products 
under the terms of our factoring agreement  we assign our accounts receivable to the factor 
the factor  in its sole discretion  determines whether or not it will accept a receivable based on its assessment of its credit risk 
once a receivable is accepted by the factor  the factor assumes substantially all of the credit risk associated with the receivable 
the factor is required to remit payments to us for the assigned accounts receivable in accordance with the terms of the assigned invoice  regardless of whether the factor receives payment on the receivable  so long as the customer does not have a valid dispute related to the invoice 
the amount remitted to us by the factor equals the invoiced amount adjusted for allowances and discounts we have provided to the customer less factor charges of of invoiced amounts for these credit and collection services 
we utilize purchase order financing arrangements in order to enable us to provide letters of credit necessary for the manufacture of our products 
manufacturers require us to present a letter of credit in order to manufacture the products required under a purchase order 
currently  we utilize letters of credit from a finance company which charges of the purchase order amount for each transaction for days 
our factor also provides purchase order financing at a cost of of the purchase order amount for each transaction for days 
additional charges are incurred if letters of credit remain outstanding in excess of the original time period and or the financing company is not paid at the time the products are received 
in addition  we may request that the factor provide us with cash advances based on our accounts receivable and inventory 
the factor may either accept or reject our request for advances at its discretion 
amounts to be paid to us by the factor for any assigned receivable are offset by any amounts previously advanced by the factor 
as our needs require  we may request that the factor advance of the eligible receivables and advance of inventory up to a maximum of million 
the interest rate is prime plus on of advances and the rate on the balance is the greater of i per annum  or ii the lesser of a the prime rate plus per annum or b per annum 
advances from customers 
on a case by case basis  distributors and other customers have agreed to provide us with cash advances on their orders 
these advances are then applied against future sales to these customers 
in exchange for these advances  we offer these customers beneficial pricing or other considerations
