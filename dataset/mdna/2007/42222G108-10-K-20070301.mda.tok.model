as of december   we had approximately million at risk  million administrative services only aso and million medicare stand alone part d members in our health plan services segment 
managed health care operations we offer a full spectrum of managed health care products and services 
our strategy is to offer to employers and individuals a wide range of managed health care products and services that  among other things  provide comprehensive coverage and contain health care costs increases 
our health plans offer members a wide range of health care services including ambulatory and outpatient physician care  hospital care  pharmacy services  behavioral health and ancillary diagnostic and therapeutic services 
our health plans include a matrix package which allows members to select their desired coverage from a variety of alternatives 
our principal commercial health products are as follows hmo plans our hmo plans offer comprehensive benefits generally through contracts with participating network physicians  hospitals and other providers 
when an individual enrolls in one of our hmo plans  he or she may select a primary care physician pcp from among the physicians participating in our network 
pcps generally are family practitioners  general practitioners or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care  and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care services  including making referrals to participating network specialists 
we offer hmo plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of co payments that result in different levels of premium rates 
in california  participating providers are typically contracted through medical groups 
in those cases  enrollees in hmo plans are generally required to secure specialty professional services from physicians in the group  as long as such services are available from group physicians 
ppo plans our ppo plans offer coverage for services received from any health care provider  with benefits generally paid at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider 
coverage typically is subject to deductibles and co payments or coinsurance 
indemnity plans our indemnity plans offer the member the ability to select any health care provider for covered services 
some care management features may be included in these plans  such as inpatient precertification  disease management programs and benefits for preventive services 
coverage typically is subject to deductibles and coinsurance 
pos plans our pos plans blend the characteristics of hmo and indemnity plans 
members can have comprehensive hmo style benefits for services received from participating network providers with lower co payments particularly within the medical group  but also have coverage  generally at higher co payment or coinsurance levels  for services received outside the network 
over the past five years  we have expanded all of our product lines  which has enabled us to offer greater flexibility to employer groups and individual insureds

community stores such as our medicare stores in phoenix  arizona and meriden  connecticut and our community enrollment and customer service centers in east los angeles  california and modesto  california 
the pricing of our products is designed to reflect the varying costs of health care based on the benefit alternatives in our products 
we provide employers and employees the ability to select and enroll in products with greater managed health care and cost containment elements 
in general  our hmos provide comprehensive health care coverage for a fixed fee or premium that does not vary with the extent or frequency of medical services actually received by the member 
ppo enrollees choose their medical care from a panel of contracting providers or choose a non contracting provider and are reimbursed on a traditional indemnity plan basis after reaching an annual deductible 
pos enrollees choose  each time they receive care  from conventional hmo or indemnity like in network and out of network coverage  with payments and or reimbursement depending on the coverage chosen 
we assume both underwriting and administrative expense risk in return for the premium revenue we receive from our hmo  pos and ppo products 
we have contractual relationships with health care providers for the delivery of health care to our enrollees in each product category

the first of these contracts  the military family counseling services mfcs  is a pilot program which provides family counseling services to members of the us military and their families at certain department of defense locations in the united states  europe and the pacific rim 
this subcontract ends on february  although we currently expect that it will be extended through march  in february  mhn was awarded a five year prime contract to develop  administer and monitor the non medical counseling program for service members 
this contract is the successor to the current mfcs counseling program that mhn has managed since services under the new contract will begin on april  the program is designed to deliver short term situational problem solving counseling  primarily with regard to stress factors inherent in the military lifestyle 
the second subcontract  domestic abuse victims advocacy dava is a pilot program which provides domestic abuse victims advocacy for military members and their families in the united states

veterans affairs during  hnfs administered contracts with the us department of veterans affairs to manage community based outpatient clinics in states 
hnfs also managed other contracts with the us department of veterans affairs in locations and one contract with the us marshals service for claims re pricing services 
total revenues for our veterans affairs business were approximately million for the year ended december   representing a increase over these revenues are derived from service fees received and have no insurance risk associated with them 
provider relationships we maintain a network of qualified physicians  hospitals and other health care providers in each of the states in which we offer managed care products and services 
physician relationships the following table sets forth the number of primary care and specialist physicians contracted either directly with our hmos or through our contracted participating physician groups ppgs as of december  primary care physicians includes both hmo and ppo physicians specialist physicians includes both hmo and ppo physicians total 
table of contents under most of our california hmo and pos plans  members are required to select a ppg and a primary care physician from within that group 
in our other plans  including all of our plans outside of california  members may be required to select a primary care physician from the broader hmo network panel of primary care physicians 
some hmo open access plans and ppo plans do not require the member to select a primary care physician 
the primary care physicians and ppgs assume overall responsibility for the care of members 
medical care provided directly by such physicians includes the treatment of illnesses not requiring referral  and may include physical examinations  routine immunizations  maternity and childcare  and other preventive health services 
the primary care physicians and ppgs are responsible for making referrals approved by the hmo s or ppg s medical director as required under the terms of our various plans to specialists and hospitals 
certain of our hmos offer enrollees open panels under which members may access any physician in the network  or network physicians in certain specialties  without first consulting their primary care physician 
ppg and physician contracts are generally for a period of at least one year and are automatically renewable unless terminated  with certain requirements for maintenance of good professional standing and compliance with our quality  utilization and administrative procedures 
in california  ppgs generally receive a monthly capitation fee for every member assigned to it 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
the capitation fee represents payment in full for all medical and ancillary services specified in the provider agreements 
in these capitation fee arrangements  in cases where the capitated ppg cannot provide the health care services needed  such ppgs generally contract with specialists and other ancillary service providers to furnish the requisite services under capitation agreements or negotiated fee schedules with specialists 
outside of california  most of our hmos reimburse physicians according to a discounted fee for service schedule  although several have capitation arrangements with certain providers and provider groups in their market areas 
for services provided under our ppo products and the out of network benefits of our pos products  we ordinarily reimburse physicians pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
health net of connecticut  inc  our connecticut hmo hn of connecticut  has a contract with the connecticut state medical society ipa csms ipa 
in  we converted this contract from a capitated risk arrangement coupled with a reinsurance agreement between csms ipa and health net services bermuda  ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  to a contractual arrangement between hn of connecticut and csms ipa that includes an agreed upon compensation budget with negotiated reimbursement rates for providers 
this contractual arrangement has gain share and pay for performance features 
we eliminated the reinsurance arrangement 
referral authorization and claims administration are now performed by health net of connecticut 
hnfs maintains a network of qualified physicians  facilities  and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our tricare contract for the north region 
services are provided on a fee for service basis 
as of december   hnfs had  physicians   facilities  and  ancillary providers in its tricare network 
our behavioral health subsidiary  mhn  maintains a provider network comprised of approximately  psychiatrists  psychologists and other clinical categories of providers nationwide 
substantially all of these providers are contracted with mhn on an individual or small practice group basis and are paid on a discounted fee for service basis 
members who wish to access behavioral health services contact mhn and are referred to contracted providers for evaluation or treatment services 
authorization for such services is for a limited number of appointments and must be renewed by mhn based on medical necessity for continuing treatment 
if a member needs inpatient services  mhn maintains a network of approximately  facilities 
in addition to the physicians that are in our networks  we have also entered into agreements with various third parties who have networks of physicians contracted to them third party networks 
in general  under a 
table of contents third party network arrangement  health net is licensed by a third party to access provider contracts under the network and pay the claims of these physicians pursuant to the pricing terms of their contracts with the third party network 
hospital relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for hospital care primarily through contracts with selected hospitals in their service areas 
these hospital contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
covered inpatient hospital care for our hmo members is comprehensive 
it includes the services of hospital based physicians  nurses and other hospital personnel  room and board  intensive care  laboratory and x ray services  diagnostic imaging and generally all other services normally provided by acute care hospitals 
hmo or ppg nurses and medical directors are actively involved in discharge planning and case management  which often involves the coordination of community support services  including visiting nurses  physical therapy  durable medical equipment and home intravenous therapy 
in  we began to see evidence that claims review practices by our california health plan  such as line item review of itemized billing statements and adjustments to the level of prices charged on stop loss claims  were causing significant friction with hospitals 
we responded by attempting to negotiate changes to the terms of our hospital contracts  in many cases to incorporate fixed reimbursement payment methodologies intended to reduce our exposure to the stop loss claims 
as a result  we experienced an increase in arbitration requests and other litigation involving providers 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into negotiations in an attempt to settle a large number of provider disputes in our california and northeast health plans  the majority of which related to alleged underpayment of stop loss claims 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pretax charge of million for expenses associated with provider settlements that had been or were in the process of being resolved  principally involving the alleged underpayment of stop loss claims 
as of december   the provider dispute settlements were substantially completed  and during no significant modifications were made to the original estimated provider dispute liability amount 
in connection with these settlements  we have entered into new contracts with a large portion of our provider network 
hn california s hospital claims editing practices were subsequently investigated by the california department of managed health care dmhc 
following the investigation and as a result of discussions between the dmhc and hn california  on october   hn california entered into a consent agreement with the dmhc 
under the consent agreement  hn california agreed to allow contracted providers to resubmit their claims for dates of service after january   if such claims had been subjected to line item review or adjustments to the level of prices charged on the claims  so that such claims could be re adjudicated without such editing practices and additional payment could be made if due 
hospitals that had settled such claims with hn california in the provider dispute settlements discussed above are not permitted to resubmit claims under the process established pursuant to the consent agreement 
in addition  hn california agreed to pay an administrative penalty of  and to cease using these editing practices 
ancillary and other provider relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for ancillary and other provider services  such as ambulance  laboratory  radiology and home health  primarily through contracts with selected providers in their service areas 
these contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
in certain cases  these provider services are included in contracts our health plan subsidiaries have with ppgs and hospitals 

table of contents additional information concerning our business competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations  new strategic alliances  legislative reform and market pressures brought about by a better informed and better organized customer base 
our health plans face substantial competition from for profit and nonprofit hmos  ppos  self funded plans including self insured employers and union trust funds  blue cross blue shield plans  and traditional indemnity insurance carriers  some of which have substantially larger enrollments and greater financial resources than we do 
the development and growth of companies offering internet based connections between health care professionals  employers and members  along with a variety of services  could also create additional competitors 
we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered  size and quality of provider network  quality of service  responsiveness to user demands  financial stability  comprehensiveness of coverage  diversity of product offerings  and market presence and reputation 
the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors vary by market 
over the past several years  a health plan s ability to interact with employers  members and other third parties including health care professionals via the internet has become a more important competitive factor 
to that end  we have made technology investments to enhance our electronic interactions with third parties 
we believe that we compete effectively against other health care industry participants 
our primary competitors in california are kaiser permanente  blue cross of california  unitedhealth group  inc and blue shield of california 
together  these four plans and health net account for a majority of the insured market in california 
kaiser is the largest hmo in california based on number of enrollees and blue cross of california is the largest ppo provider in california based on number of enrollees 
there are also a number of small  regional based health plans that compete with health net in california  mainly in the small business group market segment 
in addition  two of the major national managed care companies  aetna  inc and cigna corp  are active in california 
their respective commercial full risk market share is not as significant as our primary competitors in california and we believe that each remains in california primarily to serve their national  self funded accounts california employees 
our largest competitor in arizona is blue cross blue shield 
our arizona hmo also competes with unitedhealth group inc  cigna  aetna and humana inc our oregon health plan competes primarily against kaiser  unitedhealth group  providence  regence blue cross blue shield  pacificsource and lifewise 
in the northeast  our connecticut health plan competes for business with aetna  wellpoint  inc anthem bcbs  connecticare  inc  unitedhealth group  inc unitedhealthcare oxford health plans  and cigna 
our main competitors in new york are unitedhealth group  inc unitedhealthcare oxford health plans  wellpoint  inc empirebcbs wellchoice  aetna  and cigna 
our main competitors in new jersey are unitedhealth group  inc unitedhealthcare oxford health plans  horizon bcbs  aetna and cigna 
marketing and sales we market our products and services to individuals and employer groups through inside sales staff  independent brokers  agents and consultants and through the internet 
for our group health business  we market our products and services utilizing a three step process 
we first market to potential employer groups  group insurance brokers and consultants 
we then provide information directly to employees once the employer has selected our health coverage 
finally  we engage members and employers in marketing for member and group retention 
for our small group business  members are enrolled by their employer based on the plan chosen by the employer 
in general  once selected by a large employer group  we solicit enrollees from the employee base directly 
during open enrollment periods when employees are permitted to change health care programs  we use a variety of techniques to attract new enrollees  including  without limitation  direct mail  work day and health fair presentations and telemarketing 
our sales efforts are supported by our marketing division  which 
table of contents engages in product research and development  multicultural marketing  advertising and communications  and member education and retention programs 
premiums for each employer group are generally contracted on a yearly basis and are payable monthly 
we consider numerous factors in setting our monthly premiums  including employer group needs and anticipated health care utilization rates as forecasted by us based on the demographic composition of  and our prior experience in  our service areas 
premiums are also affected by applicable regulations that in certain circumstances prohibit experience rating of group accounts ie  setting the premium for the group based on its past use of health care services and by state regulations governing the manner in which premiums are structured 
in some of our markets we sell individual policies  which are generally sold through independent brokers and agents 
in some states  carriers are allowed to individually underwrite these policies ie select applicants to whom coverage will be provided and others who are denied  although in other states there may be a requirement of guaranteed issue that restricts the carrier s discretion 
in guaranteed issue states  exclusions for preexisting conditions are generally permitted 
where individual underwriting is permitted  the carrier may rescind the policy coverage if the individual misrepresents his or her medical history in the application process 
see item risk factors proposed federal and state legislation affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us for additional information on health plans right to rescind coverage 
we believe that the importance of the ultimate health care consumer or member in the health care product purchasing process is likely to increase in the future  particularly in light of advances in technology and online resources 
accordingly  we are focusing our marketing strategies on the development of distinct brand identities and innovative product service offerings that will appeal to potential health plan members 
for example  we introduced decision power sm  which is a series of programs designed to more directly involve patients in their health care decisions 
these programs allow our members to access information and consult with health coaches as they are making decisions regarding health care issues 
in addition  in we added a number of enhancements on the it s your life wellsight sm on the company s website 
the new wellsite gives commercial and medicare members easy access to information they need to make smarter choices about their health and about their health care and health care costs 
as more employers begin to offer consumer directed health plans such as health savings accounts hsas and health reimbursement accounts hras  we believe consumers need to be able to learn  plan and make complex decisions regarding their health care 
our new wellsite combines access to current health net and vendor content and tools 
consumer directed health care plans  health savings accounts and health reimbursement accounts health savings accounts were created in as part of the mma 
hsas are individually owned accounts  similar to an ira or a k retirement plan  that generally allow employees or individuals to make contributions to the account on a pretax basis 
funds in hsas can be used to pay for certain qualified medical expenses such as plan deductibles  copayments and coinsurance on a tax free basis 
hsa funds can be invested and earnings on the investments are generally tax free 
hsas must be used in conjunction with high deductible health plans 
high deductible health plans provide in and out of network benefits and cover a wide range of health care services 
our northeast and arizona health plans launched hsa programs in and our california and oregon health plans launched hsa programs in our hsa programs and other consumer driven health care products provide our members with tools to determine what health care services they may need and to estimate how much those services would cost 
we support our consumer directed programs with web based services that assist members in educating themselves about health care 
the web based program includes webmd s subimo estimator tools  decision power sm  prescription drug and hospital comparison tools 
in  we expect to further enhance our consumer driven health care initiative by offering the health net health reimbursement account 
an hra is a health reimbursement arrangement funded solely by an employer 
table of contents where the employer reimburses an employee for health expenses not covered by the group health insurance plan such as deductibles and coinsurance amounts 
employees are reimbursed tax free for qualified medical expenses that the employer agrees to reimburse  up to a maximum dollar amount for a coverage period 
subject to the employer s discretion  up to of any unused amounts in the hra at the end of a plan year can be carried forward for reimbursement in subsequent years

risk factors our efforts to capitalize on business opportunities provided by consumer directed health care could prove to be unsuccessful 
health net one systems consolidation project we are in the process of converting a number of information systems in our health plan business to a single system environment 
at the completion of the project  we expect to consolidate various systems into one general ledger system  one core claims system  one data warehouse system and one core web system 
in addition  we expect to reduce our number of surround information systems from to and consolidate our data centers to a single site with a tested backup facility 
key actions completed on the health net one systems consolidation project to date include consolidation to a single general ledger  consolidation of health plan web portals  consolidation of data centers to a single site with backup facilities  consolidation to surround information systems  consolidation to a single customer service system and conversion of arizona s core claims system 
in late  we converted to a common eligibility database and in we converted the northeast and arizona health plans to a common provider database and data warehouse 
in order to increase our focus on market demands  revenue generation and cost containment initiatives and to ensure the continued stabilization of claim payment patterns  we have changed the sequence of the health net one initiatives  placing the medical management initiatives and developing market capabilities  including medicare part d ahead of the claim components of health net one 
the new medical management system was implemented in the northeast and arizona health plans for case management functionality and implementing medicare part d capabilities in the northeast  arizona  california and oregon commercial health plans were converted to the new authorization and reporting medical management system in as a result  the conversion of the california and oregon claim components of health net one was rescheduled for this strategy permits continued focus on delivering capabilities to meet market demands  increase revenues and continue cost containment initiatives 
we believe that completion of the health net one systems consolidation project will improve customer service and communication  enhance our national product capabilities  realize operational and cost efficiencies and improve our decision making capability 
in addition  we believe that completion of the project will enable us to improve our claims turnaround time  auto adjudication rates  electronic data interchange and internet capabilities 
however  there are risks associated with the health net one systems consolidation project 
see item a 
risk factors if we fail to effectively maintain our management information systems  it could adversely affect our business 
medical management we believe that managing health care costs is an essential function for a managed care company 
among the medical management techniques we utilize to contain the growth of health care costs are pre authorization or certification for outpatient and inpatient hospitalizations and a concurrent review of active inpatient hospital stays and discharge planning 
we believe that this authorization process reduces inappropriate use of medical resources and achieves efficiencies in cases where reimbursement is based on risk sharing arrangements 
we also contract with third parties to manage certain conditions such as neonatal intensive care unit admissions and stays  as well as chronic conditions such as asthma  diabetes and congestive heart failure 
these techniques are widely used in the managed care industry and are accepted practice in the medical profession 
accreditation we pursue accreditation for certain of our health plans from the national committee for quality assurance ncqa and the utilization review accreditation commission urac 
ncqa and urac are 
table of contents independent  non profit organizations that review and accredit hmos 
hmos that comply with review requirements and quality standards receive accreditation 
our arizona  california  connecticut  new jersey and new york hmo subsidiaries have all received ncqa accreditation with a score of excellent  which is the highest score ncqa awards 
our mhn subsidiary has received urac accreditation 
government regulation our business is subject to comprehensive federal regulation and state regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
these laws and regulations govern how we conduct our businesses and result in additional requirements  restrictions and costs to us 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all current state and federal laws and regulations applicable to our businesses 
certain of these laws and regulations are discussed below 
federal legislation and regulation medicare legislation 
on december   the mma was signed into law 
this complex legislation made many significant structural changes to the federal medicare program and added a voluntary prescription drug benefit  called a part d benefit  which was made available to medicare beneficiaries starting january  the mma changed the methodology for payment to private plans to a competitive bidding process beginning in for the medicare advantage plans  the federal centers for medicare medicaid services cms calculates county specific payment rates based on fee for service costs in the county and a legislated formula 
these rates then serve as a benchmark against which we must bid for providing the medicare package of services 
the projected savings from the benchmark rate is used to fund additional benefits to members 
the remaining is retained by cms 
cms then pays us a monthly rate for each enrollee  which is the bid amount  with risk adjustment for that member  plus the of savings if any in the bid 
the risk adjustment factor reflects the member s age  gender and health status 
the mma also authorized regional ppos to serve regions covering the us and its territories  and authorized other products designed to provide a private market option on a broader scale 
our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms 
cms has the right to audit hmos and ppos operating under medicare contracts to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 
medicaid and related legislation 
federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government  such as the medicaid program known as medi cal in california and schip 
they are largely regulated and administered by state agencies and thus there are variations in these programs from state to state 
federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs 
federal law permits the federal government to oversee and  in some cases  to enact  regulations and other requirements that must be followed by the states 
medicaid is administered at the federal level by cms  schip is administered by the health resources and services administration  another arm of the department of health and human services 
privacy regulations 
the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the federal  state and local level 
these laws and regulations are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of the gramm leach bliley act 
hipaa and the implementing regulations that have been adopted in connection therewith impose obligations for issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors relating to the privacy and 
table of contents security of transmitted protected health information phi 
the regulations  consisting of privacy regulations  transactions and codeset requirements and security regulations require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  adopt rigorous internal procedures to protect phi  create policies related to the privacy of phi and enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
we are in compliance with the hipaa privacy regulations  the requirements relating to transactions and codesets and the security regulations 
the gramm leach bliley act generally requires insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares non public personal information with a non affiliated third party 
like hipaa  this law sets a floor standard  allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection 
erisa 
most employee benefit plans are regulated by the federal government under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
employment based health coverage is such an employee benefit plan 
erisa is administered  in large part  by the us department of labor dol 
erisa contains disclosure requirements for documents that define the benefits and coverage 
it also contains a provision that causes federal law to preempt state law in the regulation and governance of certain benefit plans and employer groups  including the availability of legal remedies under state law 
other federal regulations 
we must comply with  and are affected by  laws and regulations relating to the award  administration and performance of us government contracts 
government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and  in some instances  impose added costs on our business 
a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts 
state laws and regulations our hmos  insurance companies and behavioral health plan are subject to extensive state regulation 
set forth below are the principal hmo regulatory agencies that govern our health plans and insurance companies 
company regulatory agency arizona hmo arizona department of insurance california hmo california department of managed health care connecticut hmo connecticut department of insurance new jersey hmo new jersey department of banking and insurance new york hmo new york department of insurance and new york department of health oregon hmo oregon department of business and consumer services health net life insurance company california department of insurance generally  and the department of insurance of each state in which it does business health net insurance company of new york new york department of insurance mhn california department of managed health care 
table of contents while there are state by state variations  hmo regulation generally is very comprehensive 
among the areas regulated by these regulatory agencies are adequacy of financial resources  network of health care providers and administrative operations  sales and enrollment requirements  disclosure documents and notice requirements  product offerings  including the scope of mandatory benefits and required offerings of benefits that are optional coverages  procedures for member grievance resolution and medical necessity determinations  accessibility of providers  handling of provider claims including out of network claims and adherence to timely and accurate payment and appeal rules  and linguistic and cultural accessibility standards  governance requirements and reporting requirements 
variations in state regulation also arise in connection with the intensity of government oversight 
variations include the need to file or have affirmatively approved certain proposals before use or implementation by the health plan  the degree of review and comment by the regulatory agency  the amount and type of reporting by the health plan to the regulatory agency  the extent and frequency of audit or other examination  and the authority and extent of investigative activity  enforcement action  corrective action authority  and penalties and fines 
insurance and hmo laws impose a number of financial requirements and restrictions on our regulated subsidiaries  which vary from state to state 
they generally include certain minimum capital and deposit and or reserve requirements  restrictions on dividends and other distributions to the parent corporations and affiliated corporations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources statutory capital requirements 
several states have increased minimum capital requirements  in response to proposals by the national association of insurance commissioners to institute risk based capital requirements 
these financial requirements are subject to change  which may require us to commit additional capital to certain regulated subsidiaries or may limit our ability to move capital through dividends and other distributions 
our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to legal restrictions on our ability to price our products 
some products may be subject to regulatory approval of premium levels 
generally  insurance and hmo laws require premium to be established at amounts reasonably related to our costs 
pending federal and state legislation there are a number of other legislative initiatives and proposed regulations currently pending or previously proposed at the federal and state levels which could increase regulation of  and costs incurred by  the health care industry 
these measures and other initiatives  if enacted  could have significant adverse effects on our operations 
see item a 
risk factors proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of the pending legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulation 
intellectual property we have registered and maintain various service marks  trademarks and trade names that we use in our businesses  including marks and names incorporating the health net phrase  and from time to time we apply for additional registrations of such marks 
we utilize these and other marks and names in connection with the marketing and identification of products and services 
we believe such marks and names are valuable and material to our marketing efforts 

table of contents employees as of december   health net  inc and its subsidiaries employed  persons on a full time basis and persons on a part time or temporary basis 
these employees perform a variety of functions  including  among other things  provision of administrative services for employers  providers and members  negotiation of agreements with physician groups  hospitals  pharmacies and other health care providers  handling of claims for payment of hospital and other services  and provision of data processing services 
our employees are not unionized and we have not experienced any work stoppages since our inception 
we consider our relations with our employees to be very good 
dependence upon customers the federal government is the only customer of the company s government contracts segment  with premiums and fees accounting for of our government contracts revenue 
in addition  the federal government is a significant customer of the company s health plan services segment as a result of its contract with cms for coverage of medicare eligible individuals

shareholder rights plan on july   our board of directors approved the extension of the benefits afforded by our former shareholder rights plan  which expired at the close of business on july   by adopting a new shareholder rights plan pursuant to a rights agreement with wells fargo bank  na the rights agent  dated as of july  the rights agreement 

table of contents in connection with the rights agreement  on july   our board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one right a right for each outstanding share of common stock  to stockholders of record at the close of business on august  the record date

our profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict and control health care costs 
a substantial majority of the revenue we receive is used to pay the costs of health care services or supplies delivered to our members 
the total health care costs we incur are affected by the number and type of individual services provided and the cost of each service 
our future profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict health care costs and to control future health care utilization and costs through underwriting criteria  utilization management  product design and negotiation of favorable professional and hospital contracts 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts  coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  may result in increased health care costs or limit our ability to 
table of contents negotiate favorable rates 
changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment  health care practices  inflation  new technologies  clusters of high cost cases  continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups and numerous other factors affecting health care costs may adversely affect our ability to predict and control health care costs as well as our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  a large scale public health epidemic  such as the avian flu  could affect our ability to control health care costs 
see large scale public health epidemics and or terrorist activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 
for several years  one of the fastest increasing categories of our health care costs has been the cost of hospital based products and services 
factors underlying the increase in hospital costs include  but are not limited to  the underfunding of public programs  such as medicaid and medicare  growing rates of uninsured individuals  new technology  state initiated mandates  alleged abuse of hospital chargemasters  an aging population and  under certain circumstances  relatively low levels of hospital competition 
another significant category of our health care costs is costs of pharmaceutical products and services 
recently  the rate of increase in pharmaceutical costs has not been as a great as prior years due to a movement of several high volume drugs to lower cost generic status 
other factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include  but are not limited to  the price of drugs  utilization of new and existing drugs and changes in discounts 
as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by without a proportional change in related revenues for our health plan products  our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million 
the inability to forecast and manage our health care costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs  we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
while health plans compete on the basis of many factors  including service and the quality and depth of provider networks  price will continue to be a significant basis of competition 
our premium revenue is set in advance of the actual delivery of services  and  in certain circumstances  before contracting with providers 
while we attempt to take into account our estimate of expected health care costs over the premium period in setting the premiums we charge  factors such as competition  regulations and other circumstances may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs 
in addition  many factors may  and often do  cause actual health care costs to exceed those costs estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased utilization of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  seasonality  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  and insured population characteristics 
our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by significant disparities between the premium increases of our health plans and those of our major competitors or by limitations on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels 
over the course of and  we instituted premium increases at the high end of the range of premium increases instituted by our competitors in order to improve margins on our commercial health plan business 
we lost members as a result of these premium increases 
in  our pricing was  we believe  more consistent with that of our competitors but there can be no assurance that we will not reinstitute higher premiums in the future 
any future increase in premiums could result in the loss of members 
maintaining premiums at the high end of the market also increases the risk that our health plans are affected by adverse risk selection 
adverse risk selection occurs when members who utilize higher levels of health care services compared with the insured population as a whole choose to remain with our health plans at the higher premium rates rather than risk moving to another plan 
this could cause health care costs to be higher than anticipated and therefore cause our financial results to fall short of expectations 

table of contents in the various states in which we do business  premium prices are also constrained by state laws and regulations which restrict the spread between premiums and benefits  such as laws and regulations that require a minimum loss ratio of a certain percentage 
these laws and regulations not only restrict our ability to raise our premiums but also create competitive pressure from some of our competitors who may have lower health care costs than we have and therefore price their premiums at relatively low levels in relation to our cost of care 
our inability to estimate and maintain appropriate levels of reserves for claims may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our reserves for claims are estimates of future costs based on various assumptions 
the accuracy of these estimates may be affected by external forces such as changes in the rate of inflation  the regulatory environment  the judicious administration of claims  medical costs and other factors 
included in the reserves for claims are estimates for the costs of services that have been incurred but not reported and for claims received but not processed 
these estimates are continually monitored and reviewed and  as settlements are made or estimates adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates  the actual liability could differ significantly from the amounts reserved 
if our actual liability for claims payments is higher than estimated  it could have a negative impact on our earnings per share in any particular quarter or annual period 
if our actual liability is lower than estimated  it could mean that we set premium prices too high  which could result in a loss of membership 
if we were to lose membership as a result of our premium prices being set too high  there can be no assurance that we would be able to regain that membership by reducing premiums 
our businesses are subject to significant government regulation  which increases our cost of doing business and could adversely affect our ability to grow our businesses 
our businesses are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  financial requirements  licensing requirements  enrollment requirements and periodic examinations by governmental agencies 
these laws and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders of managed health care companies such as health net 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering these regulations 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business and may restrict our revenue and or enrollment growth  and or increase our health care and administrative costs  and or increase our exposure to liability with respect to members  providers or others 
in particular  our hmo and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations relating to cash reserves  minimum net worth  premium rates  and approval of policy language and benefits 
although these regulations have not significantly impeded the growth of our businesses to date  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statutory capital requirements for additional information 
as a government contractor  we are subject to us government oversight 
the government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  a negative determination resulting from such claims could result in a contractor being fined  debarred and or suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
we are also exposed to other risks associated with us government contracting  including dependence upon congressional appropriation and allotment of funds 
in addition  laws or regulations adopted in the future could adversely affect our business 
see proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed care industry could adversely affect us 

table of contents delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals  or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities  could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members  increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 
our efforts to capitalize on medicare business opportunities could prove to be unsuccessful 
medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business  accounting for approximately of our total revenue in and an expected in over the last several years we have significantly expanded our medicare health plans and restructured our medicare program management team and operations to enhance our ability to pursue business opportunities presented by the mma and the medicare program generally 
for example  we recently introduced private fee for service pffs medicare advantage plans  expanded our medicare part d prescription drug benefits plans to all states  and are in the process of enhancing our hmo ppo product offerings 
this growth requires substantial administrative and operational capabilities which we have developed or for which we have contracted 
for example  we use a third party vendor to administer the enrollment and billing functions for medicare part d and pffs  as well as processing claims for pffs 
if the execution of these key operational functions is not successful  or we are unable to develop administrative capabilities to address the additional needs of our growing medicare programs  it could have a material adverse effect on our medicare business 
particular risks associated with our providing medicare part d prescription drug benefits under the mma include potential uncollectability of receivables  inadequacy of pricing assumptions  inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs  as well as the underlying seasonality of this business 
in addition  in connection with our participation in the medicare advantage and part d programs  we regularly record revenues associated with the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism employed by cms 
this mechanism is designed to appropriately reimburse health plans for the relative health care cost risk of its medicare enrollees 
while we have historically recorded revenue and received payment for risk adjustment reimbursement settlements  there can be no assurance that we will receive payment from cms for the levels of the risk adjustment premium revenue recorded in any given quarter 
if the cost and complexity of the recent medicare changes exceed our expectations or prevent effective program implementation  if the government alters or reduces funding of medicare programs because of the higher than anticipated cost to taxpayers of the mma or for other reasons  if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants  or if we are not successful in winning contract renewals or new contracts under the mma s competitive bidding process  our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected  and we may not be able to realize any return on our investments in medicare initiatives 
a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
approximately of our revenues relate to federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  such as medicare  medicaid and tricare 
all of the revenues in our government contracts segment come from the federal government 
under government funded health programs  the government payor typically determines premium and reimbursement levels 
if the government payor reduces premium or reimbursement levels or increases them by less than our costs increase  and we are unable to make offsetting adjustments through supplemental premiums and changes in benefit plans  we could be adversely affected 
contracts under these programs are generally subject to frequent change  including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the revenue received by us or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
changes of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes to government health care coverage programs in the future may also affect our willingness to participate in these programs 

table of contents the amount of government receivables set forth in our consolidated financial statements represents our best estimate of the government s liability to us under tricare and other federal government contracts 
in general  government receivables are estimates and subject to government audit and negotiation 
in addition  inherent in government contracts are an uncertainty of and vulnerability to disagreements with the government 
final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize on our financial statements 
health care operations under our tricare north contract are scheduled to conclude on march   unless extended by the department of defense 
the department of defense has the option to extend the tricare north contract for up to two additional one year option periods 
if the department of defense elects to extend for two additional one year option periods and both option periods are exercised  the tricare north contract would conclude on march  if the department of defense does not elect to extend our tricare north contract  we will be required to participate in the bidding process for a new contract 
if we were not awarded a new tricare contract  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid 
currently  many states are experiencing budget deficits  and some states  including california  have reduced or have begun to reduce  or have proposed reductions in  payments to medicaid managed care providers 
any significant reduction in payments received in connection with medicaid could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may experience losses as a result of the regional concentration of our business 
our business operations are concentrated in the northeast in the states of connecticut  new york and new jersey and in the states of california  arizona and oregon 
our california operations represented approximately of our total revenue in due to this concentration in a small number of states  and  in particular  california  we are exposed to the risk of a deterioration in our financial results arising from a significant economic downturn in one or more of these states 
if economic conditions in these states significantly deteriorate  we may experience a reduction in existing and new business  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if any one of our health plans experiences significant losses  our consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
a deterioration in margins in any one of the states in which we operate  or a loss of large accounts to national competitors  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations if we are unable to offset the deterioration with adequate future premium increases 
proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us 
the united states congress and federal and state regulatory agencies frequently consider legislative proposals and regulatory initiatives which  if enacted  could materially affect the managed health care industry and the regulatory environment 
these proposals have included initiatives which  if enacted  could have significant adverse effects on our operations  including subjecting us to additional litigation risk  regulatory compliance costs and restrictions on our business operations 
such measures have proposed  among other things  to restrict or eliminate health insurers and health plans in the marketplace  restrict a health insurer or health plan s profitability or regulate the medical cost ratio  require health plans to pay significantly higher taxes  or reduce government funding of government sponsored health programs in which we participate  restrict the ability of health plans to establish member financial responsibility  
table of contents mandate certain benefits and services that could increase the cost of healthcare or administrative services  or to manage the member s care through authorization requirements  requirements of medical necessity  or formularies for covered pharmaceuticals  restrict our ability to contract with and manage access to providers and provider groups  enhance certain provider payments or appeal rights  or restrict our ability to select and terminate providers  mandate certain grievance and appeal rights for our members  including establishment of third party reviews of certain care decisions  and regulate the individual coverage market by restricting or mandating premium levels  restrict our underwriting discretion  or restrict our ability to rescind coverage based on a member s misrepresentations and omissions 
recently  the issue of affordable health insurance and the challenge of insuring the uninsured have generated much public attention 
in states where we conduct business  governors and state legislatures are considering various proposals to cover the uninsured 
these proposals include  but are not limited to  restructuring the health insurance market to mandate coverage  guaranteeing insurance in the individual market  merging individual and small group markets  placing a cap on loss ratios or premiums or otherwise taking steps to expand access to health insurance in a manner that does not allow for management of risk 
the decisions of health plans to rescind coverage and decline payment to treating providers has also generated public attention  particularly in california 
this has  in turn  generated a petition by a consumer group to the dmhc to adopt regulations to restrict these practices 
the dmhc is currently considering such a regulation and has held a public hearing on the subject 
on february   a bill was introduced in the california legislature that further restricts a health plan s or insurer s ability to rescind the beneficiary s coverage and to deny payment to treating providers 
we cannot predict the outcome of the legislative and regulatory proposals described above or any other such legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulations 
such legislation or regulation  including measures that would cause us to change our current manner of operation or increase our exposure to liability  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and ability to compete in our industry 
federal and state audits  review and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have been and  in some cases  currently are  involved in various federal and state governmental audits  reviews and investigations 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments and others 
such audits  reviews and investigations could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in certain programs  or the imposition of civil or criminal fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
many regulatory audits  reviews and investigations in recent years have focused on the timeliness and accuracy of claims payments by managed care companies and health insurers 
our subsidiaries have been the subject of audits  reviews and investigations of this nature 
depending on the circumstances and the specific matters reviewed  regulatory findings could require remediation of claims payment errors and payment of penalties of material amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
for example  we are currently the subject of a regulatory investigation in new jersey that relates to the timeliness and accuracy of our claim payments for services rendered by out of network providers 
the new jersey department of banking and insurance new jersey dobi has commenced an audit of our claims 
table of contents payment practices for out of network claims 
depending on the outcome of the audit  the new jersey dobi could impose monetary fines or require remediation of out of network claims payment inaccuracies which could have significant adverse effects on our business 
our new jersey and new york health plans have also been subject to other investigations by the new jersey dobi and the new york department of insurance on a variety of other claims payment matters and in some cases have entered into consent agreements relating to  and have agreed to pay fines in connection with  these claims payment practices 
similarly  hn california  our california hmo  has entered into a consent agreement with the california dmhc regarding its prepayment line item review and repricing processes 
see item business provider relationships hospital relationships for additional information 
in addition  from time to time  agencies of the us government investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with regulations applicable to government contractors 
us government investigations of us  whether relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons  could result in administrative  civil or criminal liabilities  including repayments  fines or penalties being imposed upon us  or could lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracting  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to maintain good relations with the physicians  hospitals and other providers that we contract with  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals and other providers as a means to assure access to health care services for our members  to manage health care costs and utilization and to better monitor the quality of care being delivered 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments or take other actions  including litigation  which could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers and members  disruption to provider access for current members or to support growth  or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations and multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or even monopolies 
some of these providers may compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market our products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
we contract with professional providers in california primarily through capitation fee arrangements 
we also use capitation fee arrangements in areas other than california  but to a lesser extent 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
provider groups that enter into capitation fee arrangements generally contract with specialists and other secondary providers  and may contract with primary care physicians  to provide services 
the inability of provider groups to properly manage costs under capitation arrangements can result in their financial instability and the termination of their relationship with us 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
in california  the liability of our hmo subsidiaries for unpaid provider claims has not been definitively settled 
there can be no assurance that we will not be liable for unpaid provider claims 
there can also be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with secondary providers  the failure of any of which could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations 
some providers that render services to our members and insureds are not contracted with our plans and insurance companies 
in those cases  there is no pre established understanding between the provider and the plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider 
in some states and product lines  the amount of compensation is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translated into dollar terms 
in such instances providers may believe they are 
table of contents underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with the plan or balance bill our member 
we may then have an obligation to protect our members against financial harm  either by paying the provider the additional amount demanded or by reimbursing the member for his her out of pocket payment 
the uncertainty of the amount to pay and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of the payment could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
provider groups and hospitals have in certain situations commenced litigation and or arbitration proceedings against us to recover amounts they allege to be underpayments due to them under their contracts with us 
we believe that provider groups and hospitals have become increasingly sophisticated in their review of claim payments and contractual terms in an effort to maximize their payments from us and have increased their use of outside professionals  including accounting firms and attorneys  in these efforts 
these efforts and the litigation and arbitration that result from them could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million pretax charge related to expenses associated with settlements involving provider disputes 
for additional information regarding provider disputes  see item legal proceedings provider disputes 
we face risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages  including punitive damages 
in addition  we incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if we fail to accurately project litigation expenses 
we are subject to a variety of legal actions to which any corporation may be subject  including employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  wage and hour claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  fraud and misrepresentation claims  shareholder suits  including suits for securities fraud  and intellectual property and real estate related disputes 
in addition  we incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability for claims related to the insurance industry in general and our business in particular  such as claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide health care  poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged  improper rescission  termination or non renewal of coverage and insufficient payments for out of network services  claims by employer groups for return of premiums  and claims by providers  including claims for withheld or otherwise insufficient compensation or reimbursement  claims related to self funded business  and claims related to reinsurance matters 
such actions can also include allegations of fraud  misrepresentation  and unfair or improper business practices and can include claims for punitive damages 
also  there are currently  and may be in the future  attempts to bring class action lawsuits against various managed care organizations  including us 
in some of the cases pending against us  substantial non economic or punitive damages are also being sought 
for example in mccoy v 
health net  inc et al  and wachtel v 
guardian life insurance co  the plaintiffs allege that the manner in which our various subsidiaries paid member claims for out of network services was improper 
plaintiffs sought severe sanctions against us for a variety of alleged misconduct  discovery abuses and fraud on the court 
in december  the court in the mccoy and wachtel matters issued an order against us that  among other things  required us to pay plaintiffs attorneys fees in connection with the sanctions proceedings in an amount to be determined at a later date 
in addition  the court ordered that a special master be retained at our expense to monitor the completion of discovery in the case and assessed a monetary fine against us in an amount to be determined at a later date 
based on our assessment of developments in this litigation  during the three months ended december   we recorded a pretax charge of approximately million in anticipation of our ongoing litigation defense expenses in these cases  as well as the probable award of attorneys fees 
see item legal proceedings for additional information regarding the mccoy and wachtel matters and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the pretax charge 
we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty  and we are incurring material expenses in the defense of litigation matters  including without limitation  substantial discovery costs 
while we currently have insurance coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation  other such liabilities such as 
table of contents punitive damages or the cost of implementing changes in our operations required by the resolution of a claim  may not be covered by insurance 
in addition  the insurers could dispute coverage or the amount of insurance could not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded 
insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level that would result in us effectively self insuring cases against us 
the deductible on our errors and omissions e o insurance has reached such a level 
given the amount of the deductible  the only cases which would be covered by our e o insurance are those involving claims that substantially exceed our average claim values and otherwise qualify for coverage under the terms of the insurance policy 
recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of the types of claims we face 
there is a risk that we could incur substantial legal fees and expenses  including discovery expenses  in any of the actions we defend in excess of amounts budgeted for defense 
plaintiffs attorneys have increasingly used expansive electronic discovery requests as a litigation tactic 
responding to these requests  the scope of which may exceed the normal capacity of our historical systems for archiving and organizing electronic documents  may require application of significant resources and impose significant costs on us 
in certain cases  we could also be subject to awards of substantial legal fees and costs to plaintiffs counsel 
we regularly evaluate litigation matters pending against us  including those described in note to our consolidated financial statements  to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
the costs associated with any such settlement could be substantial and  in certain cases  could result in an earnings charge in any particular quarter in which we enter into a settlement agreement 
although we have recorded litigation reserves which represent our best estimate on probable losses  both known and incurred but not reported  our recorded reserves might prove to be inadequate to cover an adverse result or settlement for extraordinary matters  such as the matters described in note therefore  costs associated with the various litigation matters to which we are subject and any earnings charge recorded in connection with a settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our forecasts and other forward looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties 
our performance may not be consistent with these forecasts and forward looking statements 
from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated revenues  net earnings and other operating and financial metrics 
any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and  as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
for example  during  gross margins in our commercial and medicare lines of business were better than expected  pretax margins in our government contracts segment were higher than projected and administrative expenses were higher than expected 
in prior years  commercial and medicare health care costs have been higher than anticipated  causing margins to narrow more than expected and causing a negative impact on our financial and operating results 
the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors  including those described in this annual report on form k  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure that our performance will meet any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire mix of publicly available historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us  our services  and our industry when evaluating our forecasts and other forward looking statements relating to our operations and financial performance 

table of contents the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our products competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
we are in a highly competitive industry 
many of our competitors may have certain characteristics  capabilities or resources  such as greater market share  superior supplier arrangements and existing business relationships  that give them an advantage in competing with us 
these competitors include hmos  ppos  self funded employers  insurance companies  hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers 
in addition  other companies may enter our markets in the future  including emerging competitors in the medicare program and in consumer directed health plans 
we believe that increased funding provided by the mma will increase the number of competitors in senior health services and could affect our medicare advantage program 
for example  in  a large ppg in kern county  california was able to secure a knox keene license and a contract with cms and is now in direct competition with our medicare operations in that county 
in addition  financial services or other technology based companies could enter the market and compete with us on the basis of their streamlined administrative functions 
the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
there is a risk that our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services currently provided by us  which could result in a decrease in our revenues 
in addition  our providers and suppliers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us 
in recent years  there has been significant merger and acquisition activity in our industry and in industries that act as our suppliers  such as the hospital  physician  pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
this activity may create stronger competitors and or result in higher health care costs 
in addition  our contracts with government agencies are frequently up for re bid and the loss of any significant government contract to a competitor could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market  our ability to retain or increase customers  our revenue growth  our pricing flexibility  our control over medical cost trends and our marketing expenses may all be adversely affected 
in the past several years we have experienced significant turnover in senior management 
if we are unable to manage succession of our key executives  it could adversely affect our business 
we have experienced a high turnover in our senior management team in recent years 
while we have succession plans in place and have employment arrangements with certain of our key executives  these do not guarantee that the services of these key executives will continue to be available to us 
we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for future turnover of our senior management team 
our efforts to capitalize on business opportunities provided by consumer directed healthcare could prove to be unsuccessful 
nearly every major managed care organization has launched  announced or is developing hsa compatible high deductible health plans 
we have launched hsa programs in our northeast  arizona  california and oregon health plans 
our hsa programs represented a very small percentage of our total revenue in some of our large competitors  such as aetna and blue cross blue shield plans  have made large investments in  and heavily marketed  their consumer directed health plans and have gained more enrollment in many markets across the country 
if their enrollment trend continues  it may widen the competitive gap between us over the next several years 
if we fail to design  maintain and effectively market consumer directed health care programs that are attractive to consumers and  as a result  are unable to achieve a competitive market share in the consumer directed care category  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness  or need to refinance existing indebtedness  in the future  which may adversely affect our operations 
our indebtedness includes million of borrowings under a bridge loan agreement  which are due in march  and million of borrowings under a term loan agreement  which are due in june in addition  to provide liquidity  we have a million five year revolving credit facility that expires in june as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we may incur additional debt in the future 
our existing indebtedness  and any additional debt we incur in the future through drawings on our revolving credit facility or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce funds available to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general operating requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
we are considering alternative financing options  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and or potential structured financing arrangements  to repay the amounts outstanding under the bridge loan agreement on or prior to maturity 
our ability to obtain any financing  whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry and generally  credit ratings and numerous other factors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could  in addition to other negative effects  have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
we are a holding company and a substantial amount of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends and maintenance of minimum levels of capital 
as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
consequently  our cash flow and our ability to pay our debt depends  in part  on the amount of cash that we receive from our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries ability to make any payments to us will depend on their earnings  business and tax considerations  legal and regulatory restrictions and economic conditions 
in addition  in certain states our regulated subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements  known as rbc 
these laws require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk based capital calculations to the departments of insurance in their state of domicile and the national association of insurance commissioners 
failure to maintain the minimum rbc standards could subject certain of our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action  including increased reporting and or state supervision 
in addition  in most states  we are required to seek prior approval before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts 
our regulated subsidiaries are currently in compliance with the risk based capital or other similar requirements imposed by their respective states of domicile 
if our regulated subsidiaries are restricted from paying us dividends or otherwise making cash transfers to us  it could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and health net  inc s free cash flow

table of contents our revolving credit facility  bridge loan agreement and term loan agreement contain restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our revolving credit facility  bridge loan agreement and term loan agreement require us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and engage in other activities 
in addition  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum borrower cash flow fixed charge coverage ratio or  depending on our debt rating by moody s and or s p  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth requirement 
the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility  bridge loan agreement and term loan agreement could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies 
in addition  any failure by us to comply with the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility  bridge loan agreement or term loan agreement could result in an event of default under those borrowing arrangements  in which case the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
if we fail to effectively maintain our management information systems  it could adversely affect our business 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our management information systems assists us in  among other things  pricing our services  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  billing our customers on a timely basis and identifying accounts for collection 
our customers and providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verification  claims status and other information 
we have many different information systems for our various businesses and these systems require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our merger  acquisition and divestiture activity requires frequent transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information management systems 
we are in the process of consolidating a significant number of our core and surround systems as part of our health net one systems consolidation project 
see item business additional information concerning our business health net one systems consolidation project for information regarding this consolidation project 
we believe that by consolidating our systems into one common nationwide set  we will gain operational and cost efficiencies 
any difficulty or unexpected delay associated with the transition to or from information systems  any inability or failure to properly maintain management information systems  or any inability or failure to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs  could result in operational disruptions  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  significant increases in administrative expenses and or other adverse consequences 
in addition  we may  from time to time  obtain significant portions of our systems related or other services or facilities from independent third parties which may make our operations vulnerable to adverse effects if such third parties fail to perform adequately 
we must comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates with hipaa 
in december  the department of health and human services promulgated regulations under hipaa related to the privacy and security of electronically transmitted phi 
the regulations require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to a comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  b adopt rigorous internal procedures to safeguard phi and c enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
in addition  the regulations could expose us to additional liability for  among other things  violations of the regulations by our business associates 
although we provide for appropriate protections in our contracts with our business associates  we have limited control over their 
table of contents actions and practices 
compliance with hipaa and other state and federal privacy regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates

class action lawsuits mccoy v 
health net  inc et al  and wachtel v 
guardian life insurance co 
these two lawsuits are styled as nationwide class actions and are pending in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of a class of subscribers in a number of our large and small employer group plans 
the wachtel complaint initially was filed as a single plaintiff case in new jersey state court on july  subsequently  we removed the wachtel complaint to federal court  and plaintiffs amended their complaint to assert claims on behalf of a class of subscribers in small employer group plans in new jersey on december  the mccoy complaint was filed on april  and asserts claims on behalf of a nationwide class of health net subscribers 
these two cases have been consolidated for purposes of trial 
plaintiffs allege that health net  inc  health net of the northeast  inc and health net of new jersey  inc 
violated erisa in connection with various practices related to the reimbursement of claims for services provided by out of network providers 
plaintiffs seek relief in the form of payment of benefits  injunctive and other equitable relief  and attorneys fees 
during and  the parties filed and argued various motions and engaged in limited discovery 
on april   plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification seeking to certify nationwide classes of health net subscribers 
on august   the district court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification and issued an order the class certification order certifying two nationwide classes of health net subscribers who received medical services or supplies from an out of network provider and to whom the defendants paid less than the providers actual charge during the period from to health net appealed the class certification order to the court of appeals for the third circuit 
on june   the third circuit ruled in health net s favor on the appeal 
the third circuit held that the district court s class certification opinion failed to properly define the claims  issues and defenses to be treated on a class basis 
the third circuit thus vacated the certification order and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings 
in september  the district court certified the same classes but limited them to the resolution of legal issues 
health net requested permission from the third circuit to appeal this second certification but the third circuit denied the request 
in december  health net asked the third circuit to reconsider its denial 
that motion for reconsideration was denied 
the district court has ordered that the notice to the classes be mailed forthwith and that health net pay the cost of such notice 
on january   counsel for the plaintiffs in the mccoy wachtel actions filed a separate class action against health net  inc  health net of the northeast  inc  health net of new york  inc  health net life insurance co  and health net of california  inc captioned scharfman v 
health net  inc  cv fsh ps united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of the same parties who would have been added to the mccoy wachtel action as additional class representatives had the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for leave to amend their complaint in that action 
this new action contains similar allegations to those made by the plaintiffs in the mccoy wachtel action 
it is not yet clear if this case will be subsumed into the mccoy wachtel action 
on august   plaintiffs filed a motion with the district court seeking sanctions against us for a variety of alleged misconduct  discovery abuses and fraud on the district court 
the district court held twelve days of hearings on plaintiffs sanctions motion between october and march during the course of the hearings  and in their post hearings submissions  plaintiffs also alleged that some of health net s witnesses engaged in perjury and obstruction of justice 
health net denied all such allegations 
on december   the district court issued an opinion and order finding that health net s conduct was sanctionable 
the district court 
table of contents ordered a number of sanctions against health net  including  but not limited to striking a number of health net s trial exhibits and witnesses  deeming a number of facts to be established against health net  requiring health net to retain a discovery monitor at its expense to oversee the completion of discovery in these cases  ordering that a monetary sanction be imposed upon health net once the district court reviews health net s financial records  ordering health net to pay plaintiffs counsel s fees and expenses associated with the sanctions motion and motions to enforce the district court s discovery orders and redeposing health net witnesses 
the district court also ordered that health net produce a large number of privileged documents that were first discovered and revealed by health net as a result of the email backup tape restoration effort discussed below 
while the sanctions proceedings were progressing  the district court and the magistrate judge overseeing discovery entered a number of orders relating  inter alia  to production of documents 
in an order dated may  the may order  the district court ordered the restoration  search and review of backed up emails to current and former health net associates 
the may order set an initial deadline of july   to complete the restoration  search and production of emails 
health net located  back up tapes and had to restore all of them to identify and extract those emails and attachments belonging to the associates identified in the may order 
this restoration process was complex  time consuming and expensive as it involved dealing with over billion pages of documents 
during the course of this project  health net discovered that completion of the project was technologically impossible using commercially available means by the july  deadline 
as a result  health net requested additional time to complete the project 
the district court granted an extension and ordered that the restoration and production of emails be completed by september  health net was unable to complete the project by the september  deadline and again requested additional time to complete the project 
the district court denied this request and stated that there would be a per diem penalty for every day past september  that the production was not completed 
health net completed the restoration project on november  the district court has not yet announced what  if any  penalty will be imposed for failing to meet the september  deadline 
the may order also set forth certain findings regarding plaintiffs argument that the crime fraud exception to the attorney client privilege should be applied to certain documents for which health net claimed a privilege 
in this ruling  the district court made preliminary findings that a showing of a possible crime or fraud was made with respect to health net s interactions with new jersey department of banking insurance and the payment of a second restitution in new jersey 
the review of privileged documents under the crime fraud exception was assigned by the district court to the magistrate judge  who was to review the documents and make a recommendation to the court 
on january   the magistrate judge made a recommendation that the assertion of privilege for a number of the documents was vitiated by the crime fraud exception 
health net has appealed this ruling to the district court 
on may   the district court issued another opinion regarding the privileged documents  ruling that there was a fiduciary exception to the attorney client privilege and that the fiduciary exception to the attorney client privilege should apply to this litigation 
the district court found that functions health net performs relating to medical reimbursement determinations are fiduciary functions  therefore making health net potentially liable to plaintiffs as a fiduciary under erisa 
on june   health net appealed this ruling to the third circuit 
oral argument has been held but a decision has not yet been rendered 
health net has also appealed the district court s december  order that it had waived the attorney client privilege by not claiming the privilege prior to the documents being found in the backup email tapes 
we intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this litigation 
these proceedings are subject to many uncertainties  and  given their complexity and scope  their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of these proceedings depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period

on may   we and the representatives of approximately  physicians and state and other medical societies announced that we had signed an agreement settling the lead physician provider track action 
the settlement agreement requires us to pay million to general settlement funds and million for plaintiffs legal fees 
during the three months ended march   we recorded a pretax charge of approximately million in connection with the settlement agreement  legal expenses and other expenses related to the mdl litigation 
on july   we made payments  including accrued interest  totaling approximately million 
on september   the district court issued an order granting its final approval of the settlement agreement and directing the entry of final judgment 
four physicians appealed the order approving the settlement  but each of the physicians moved to dismiss their appeals  and all of the appeals were dismissed by the eleventh circuit by june  on july   joint motions to dismiss were filed in the district court with respect to all the remaining tag along actions in mdl filed on behalf of physicians 
as a result of the physician settlement agreement  the dismissals of the various appeals  and the filing of the agreed motions to dismiss the tag along actions involving physician providers  all cases and proceedings relating to the physician provider track actions against us have been resolved 
other cases in mdl are brought on behalf of non physician health care providers against us and other managed care companies and seek certification of a nationwide class of similarly situated non physician health care providers 
these cases are still pending but have been stayed in the multi district proceeding 
on september   judge moreno dismissed one of those cases on grounds that the plaintiffs failed to file a status report 
the plaintiffs in that case subsequently filed a motion to vacate the dismissal in which they contend that they did file a status report

lawsuits relating to sale of businesses amcareco litigation we are a defendant in two related litigation matters pending in louisiana and texas state courts  both of which relate to claims asserted by three separate state receivers overseeing the liquidation of three health plans in louisiana  texas and oklahoma that were previously owned by our former subsidiary  foundation health 
table of contents corporation fhc 
in  fhc sold its interest in these plans to amcareco  inc amcareco and we retained a minority interest in the three plans after the sale 
thereafter  the three plans became known as amcare of louisiana amcare la  amcare of oklahoma amcare ok and amcare of texas amcare tx 
in  three years after the sale of the plans to amcareco  each of the amcare plans was placed under state oversight and ultimately into receivership 
the receivers for each of the amcare plans later filed suit against certain of amcareco s officers  directors and investors  amcareco s independent auditors and its outside counsel in connection with the failure of the three plans 
the three receivers also filed suit against us contending that  among other things  we were responsible as a controlling shareholder of amcareco following the sale of the plans for post acquisition misconduct by amcareco and others that caused the three health plans to fail and ultimately be placed into receivership 
the action brought against us by the receiver for amcare la action originally was filed in louisiana on june  that original action sought only to enforce a parental guarantee that fhc had issued in the amcare la receiver alleged that the parental guarantee obligated fhc to contribute sufficient capital to the louisiana health plan to enable the plan to maintain statutory minimum capital requirements 
the original action also alleged that the parental guarantee was not terminated by virtue of the sale of the louisiana plan 
the actions brought against us by amcare tx and amcare ok originally were filed in texas state court on june  and included allegations that after the sale to amcareco we were responsible for the mismanagement of the three plans by amcareco and that the three plans were insolvent at the time of the sale to amcareco 
on september  and october   respectively  the amcare tx receiver and the amcare ok receiver intervened in the pending amcare la litigation in louisiana 
thereafter  all three receivers amended their complaints to assert essentially the same claims against us and successfully moved to consolidate their three actions in the louisiana state court proceeding 
the texas state court ultimately stayed the texas action and ordered that the parties submit quarterly reports to the texas court regarding the status of the consolidated louisiana litigation 
on june   a consolidated trial of the claims asserted against us by the three receivers commenced in state court in baton rouge  louisiana 
the claims of the receiver for amcare tx were tried before a jury and the claims of the receivers for the amcare la and amcare ok were tried before the judge in the same proceeding 
on june   the jury considering the claims of the receiver for amcare tx returned a verdict against us in the amount of million  consisting of million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
the court later reduced the compensatory and punitive damages awards to million and million  respectively and entered judgments in those amounts on november  we thereafter filed a motion for suspensive appeal and posted the required security as required by law 
the proceedings regarding the claims of the receivers for amcare la and amcare ok concluded on july  on november   the court issued separate judgments on those claims that awarded million in compensatory damages to amcare la and million in compensatory damages to amcare ok 
the court later denied requests by amcare la and amcare ok for attorneys fees and punitive damages 
we thereafter filed motions for suspensive appeals in connection with both judgments and posted the required security as required by law  and the receivers for amcare la and amcare ok each appealed the orders denying them attorneys fees and punitive damages 
our appeals of the judgments in all three cases have been consolidated in the louisiana court of appeal but no briefing schedule has been set 
on january   the court of appeal vacated on procedural grounds the trial court s judgments denying the amcare la and amcare ok claims for attorney fees and punitive damages  and referred those issues instead to be considered with the merits of the main appeal pending before it 
the court of appeal also has considered and ruled on various other preliminary procedural issues related to the main appeal 
on november   we filed a complaint in the us district court for the middle district of louisiana and simultaneously filed an identical suit in the th judicial district court in east baton rouge parish seeking to nullify the three judgments that were rendered against us on the grounds of fraud and or ill practice 
we have alleged that the judgments and other prejudicial rulings rendered in these cases were the result of impermissible 
table of contents ex part contacts between the receivers litigation counsel and the trial court during the course of the litigation 
preliminary motions and exceptions have been filed by the receivers for amcare tx  amcare ok and amcare la seeking dismissal of our claim for nullification on various grounds 
those motions and exceptions have not been heard by the court 
we have vigorously contested all of the claims asserted against us by the plaintiffs in the consolidated louisiana actions since they were first filed 
we intend to vigorously pursue all avenues of redress in these cases  including the actions for nullification  post trial motions and appeals  and the prosecution of our pending but stayed cross claims against other parties

shortly after announcing the settlement on october   capital z financial services fund ii  lp  and certain of its affiliates collectively  cap z sued us cap z action in new york state court asserting claims arising out of the same big transaction that is the subject of the settlement agreement with the sntl litigation trust 
cap z had previously participated as a creditor in the superior lawsuit and is a beneficiary of the sntl litigation trust

cap z s complaint primarily alleges that we misrepresented and or concealed material facts relating to the sufficiency of the big companies reserves and about the big companies internal financial condition  including accounts receivables and the status of certain captive insurance programs 
cap z alleges that it seeks compensatory damages in excess of million  unspecified punitive damages  costs  and attorneys fees 
after removal of the case to federal court and remand back to new york state court  on december   we filed a motion to dismiss all of cap z s claims 
on may   the court issued its decision on our motion and dismissed all of cap z s claims  including claims for fraud and claim for punitive damages  except for cap z s claim for indemnification based on the assertion that fhc breached express warranties and covenants under the stock purchase agreement 
on june   cap z filed an appeal from the court s dismissal of its claims for breach of the implied covenant and fraud and dismissal of its punitive damage claim

on january   we began offering the new medicare part d prescription drug benefits 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview general we are an integrated managed care organization that delivers managed health care services through health plans and government sponsored managed care plans 
we are among the nation s largest publicly traded managed health care companies 
our mission is to help people be healthy  secure and comfortable 
we provide health benefits to approximately million individuals in states and the district of columbia through group  individual  medicare including part d  medicaid  tricare and veterans affairs programs 
our behavioral health services subsidiary  mhn  provides behavioral health  substance abuse and employee assistance programs eaps to approximately million individuals  including our own health plan members 
our subsidiaries also offer managed health care products related to prescription drugs  and offer managed health care product coordination for multi region employers and administrative services for medical groups and self funded benefits programs 
how we report our results we currently operate within two reportable segments  health plan services and government contracts  each of which is described below 
our health plan services reportable segment includes the operations of our commercial  medicare including the medicare prescription drug benefit commonly referred to as part d and medicaid health plans  the operations of our health and life insurance companies and our behavioral health and pharmaceutical services subsidiaries 
we have approximately million members  including medicare part d members  and  administrative services only aso members in our health plan services segment 
our government contracts segment includes our government sponsored managed care federal contract with the us department of defense the department of defense under the tricare program in the north region and other health care related government contracts that we administer for the department of defense 
under the tricare contract for the north region  we provide health care services to approximately million military health system mhs eligible beneficiaries active duty personnel and tricare medicare dual eligible beneficiaries  including million tricare eligibles for whom we provide health care and administrative services and million other mhs eligible beneficiaries for whom we provide aso 
how we measure our profitability our profitability depends in large part on our ability to  among other things  effectively price our health care products  manage health care costs  including pharmacy costs  contract with health care providers  attract and retain members  and manage our general and administrative g a and selling expenses 
in addition  factors such as regulation  competition and general economic conditions affect our operations and profitability 
the potential effect of escalating health care costs  as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers  may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business  and may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we measure our health plan services segment profitability based on medical care ratio mcr and pretax income 
the mcr is calculated as health plan services expense divided by health plan services premiums 
the pretax income is calculated as health plan services premiums and administrative services fees and other income less health plan services expense and g a and other net expenses 
see results of operations table of summary financial information for a calculation of our mcr and results of operations health plan services segment results for a calculation of our pretax income 

table of contents health plan services premiums include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts  including medicare part d  to provide care to enrolled medicare recipients 
medicare revenue can also include amounts for risk factor adjustments 
the amount of premiums we earn in a given year is driven by the rates we charge and enrollment levels 
administrative services fees and other income primarily includes revenue for administrative services such as claims processing  customer service  medical management  provider network access and other administrative services 
health plan services expense includes medical and related costs for health services provided to our members  including physician services  hospital and related professional services  outpatient care  and pharmacy benefit costs 
these expenses are impacted by unit costs and utilization rates 
unit costs represent the health care cost per visit  and the utilization rates represent the volume of health care consumption by our members 
general and administrative expenses include those costs related to employees and benefits  consulting and professional fees  marketing  premium taxes and assessments and occupancy costs 
such costs are driven by membership levels  introduction of new products  system consolidations and compliance requirements for changing regulations 
these expenses also include expenses associated with corporate shared services and other costs to reflect the fact that such expenses are incurred primarily to support the health plan services segment 
selling expenses consist of external broker commission expenses and generally vary with premium volume 
we measure our government contracts segment profitability based on government contracts cost ratio and pretax income 
the government contracts cost ratio is calculated as government contracts cost divided by government contracts revenue 
the pretax income is calculated as government contracts revenue less government contracts cost 
see results of operations table of summary financial information for a calculation of our government contracts cost ratio and results of operations government contracts segment results for a calculation of our pretax income 
government contracts revenue is made up of two major components health care and administrative services 
the health care component includes revenue recorded for health care costs for the provision of services to our members  including paid claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims ibnr expenses for which we are at risk  and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
the administrative services component encompasses fees received for all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contract with the government

table of contents reclassification of administrative services fee revenue we provide aso products to large employer groups in california  connecticut  new jersey and new york 
under these arrangements  we provide claims processing  customer services  medical management  provider network access and other administrative services 
effective in  we reported revenues from our aso business in a separate line item titled administrative services fees and other income in our consolidated statements of operations 
historically  aso revenue amounts were reported as part of health plan services premiums 
in recent periods  these revenues have increased to a level at which we believe that reporting them in a separate line item provides useful insight on our operations 
all affected prior period financial information reflects this reclassification

our key objectives for were to position our membership for profitable growth  respond to the changing legal and political environment  improve pretax margin  and improve cash generation to resume our stock repurchase program 
we believe we have met these key objectives as discussed below 
our total health plan enrollment increased by  members in compared to medicare part d business and the march  acquisition of certain health plan businesses of universal care  inc universal care acquisition were the primary drivers of the membership increase 
we achieved our enrollment target for medicare part d and membership reached over  members 
we have successfully integrated the members acquired in the universal care acquisition with better than expected operating results and  as a result of the universal care acquisition  have added a total of approximately  members as of december  our commercial enrollment stabilized in and new commercial sales in were nearly double the amount of new commercial sales in these increases were partially offset by decreases due to pricing competition 
we believe that our diverse products and services are well positioned to address the changing health care environment 
during  we maintained our diverse medical membership base by introducing medicare part d and other products 
our recent strategy of targeting the small group and mid market has resulted in changing the mix of our membership approximately of our commercial enrollment  including aso  is in the small group and individual segments at the end of  up from at the end of on january   we began offering medicare advantage private fee for service plans  and we began marketing our medicare part d plans in all states and the district of columbia 
we also increased the number of part d plan choices that we offer seniors from two in to three in  one of which provides beneficiaries with coverage of generic drug expenses through the coverage gap  or donut hole 
in addition  we are continuing our strategy of targeting mid market and small group segments 
our tricare membership is stable at million beneficiaries  and we have expanded our relationship with the department of defense by providing behavioral health counseling services starting in in addition  we announced on february  that our behavioral health care business unit has been awarded a five year contract to develop  administer and monitor the non medical counseling program for military service members and their families known as military family counseling services mfcs 
the total contract is valued at approximately million 
our pretax profit margins improved to for  compared to for this is attributable to our health plan services mcr improving to for  compared to for this improvement is primarily due to a focused medicare re contracting effort in late in california and arizona 
our continued focus on pricing discipline and moderating health care cost trends also contributed to the improvement 
the increase in commercial premium pmpm was for the year ended december  compared to the same period in our government contracts cost ratio also improved to for  compared to for  reflecting lower medical expenses as a result of our working effectively with tricare beneficiaries and managing to moderate health care cost trends 
partially offsetting the improvements in the health plan services mcr and the government contracts ratio are increases in general  administrative and selling expenses from our continued investment in new products and marketing support for the new sales effort 

table of contents our cash flow from operations increased by million in to million from million in during the fourth quarter of  we resumed repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program and repurchased approximately million shares for million

the results of our efforts to meet these objectives are discussed below 
net income improved to million in  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in results in reflect the impact of million in litigation  asset impairment and restructuring charges 
included in the charges were million related to the may settlement agreement to resolve the lead physician provider track action in the multidistrict class action lawsuit  and million of estimated legal defense costs to appeal a louisiana state court jury verdict related to the sale of three health plan subsidiaries 
see item legal proceedings for additional information on these litigation matters 
results for the year ended december  included a million pretax charge recorded in the fourth quarter ended december   which is discussed in more detail below 
one of our key objectives in was to effectively manage our commercial health care costs and to ensure that pricing was consistent with improving health care cost trends in order to accomplish better mcrs and improve profit margins 
pretax profit margins improved during every quarter in  and the pretax profit margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in commercial premium pmpm was for the year ended december  compared to the same period in commercial health plan membership declined at december  when compared to december   however  the rate of membership decline had begun to slow 
the health plan services mcr declined to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   primarily driven by the million charge recorded in the fourth quarter ended december  of which million was recorded in health plan services costs 
favorable commercial health care cost trends also contributed to the improvement

statutory capital requirements certain of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital and surplus requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
management believes that as of december   all of our health plans and insurance subsidiaries met their respective regulatory requirements 
by law  regulation and governmental policy  our health plan and insurance subsidiaries  which we refer to as our regulated subsidiaries  are required to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth 
the minimum statutory net worth requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  or risk based capital rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners 
the rbc formula  which calculates asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business 
table of contents risk and other factors  generates the authorized control level acl  which represents the minimum amount of net worth believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain the greater of the company action level rbc  calculated as of the acl  or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
because our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight authority  some of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital and surplus in excess of the rbc requirement  even though rbc has been adopted in their states of domicile 
we generally manage our aggregate regulated subsidiary capital above of acl  although rbc standards are not yet applicable to all of our regulated subsidiaries 
at december   we had sufficient capital to exceed this level

as necessary  we make contributions to and issue standby letters of credit on behalf of our subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations

such statutory deposits may only be drawn upon under limited circumstances relating to the protection of policyholders 
as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements  certain subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies 
such restrictions  unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted  limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations 
the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus  statutory income and unassigned surplus

the future contractual obligations in the contractual obligations table are estimated based on information currently available 
the timing of and the actual payment amounts may differ based on actual events 
surety bonds in order to secure judgment pending our appeal in the amcareco litigation  we obtained surety bonds totaling million  which are further secured by letters of credit in the amounts of million issued in december see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined under regulation s k a and the instructions thereto 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
principal areas requiring the use of estimates include revenue recognition  health care costs  reserves for contingent liabilities  amounts receivable or payable under government contracts  goodwill and recoverability of long lived assets and investments 
accordingly  we consider accounting policies on these areas to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a significant change in any one of these amounts may have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that we use 
table of contents in preparing our financial statements is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
health plan services health plan services premiums include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage for which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts including part d to provide care and services to enrolled medicare recipients 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the related enrollees are entitled to health care services 
premiums collected in advance of the month in which enrollees are entitled to health care services are recorded as unearned premiums 
we have an arrangement with cms for certain of our medicare products whereby periodic changes in our risk factor adjustment scores for certain diagnostic codes result in changes to our health plan services premium revenues 
we recognize such changes when the amounts become determinable  supportable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also have risk sharing arrangements under our medicare contracts where variances in our actual claim experience from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our contracts are shared 
from time to time  we make adjustments to our revenues based on retroactivity 
these retroactivity adjustments reflect changes in the number of enrollees subsequent to when the revenue is billed 
we estimate the amount of future retroactivity each period and accordingly adjust the billed revenue 
the estimated adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of contract renewal activity during the period and other information 
we refine our estimates and methodologies as information on actual retroactivity becomes available 
on a monthly basis  we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables to reflect allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on the creditworthiness of our customers  our historical collection rates and the age of our unpaid balances 
during this process  we also assess the recoverability of the receivables  and an allowance is recorded based upon their net realizable value 
those receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible  such as receivables from bankrupt employer groups  are fully written off against their corresponding asset account  with a debit to the allowance to the extent such an allowance was previously recorded 
reserves for claims and other settlements include reserves for claims incurred but not reported claims ibnr and received but unprocessed claims  and other liabilities including capitation payable  shared risk settlements  provider disputes  provider incentives and other reserves 
as of december   of reserves for claims and other settlements were attributed to claims reserves 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of changes in the reserve for claims 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for claims primarily by using standard actuarial developmental methodologies 
this method is also known as the chain ladder or completion factor method 
the developmental method estimates reserves for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid while taking into consideration  among other things  expected medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
a key component of the developmental method is the completion factor which is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the claims for services rendered for a given period 
while the completion factors are reliable and robust for older service periods  they are more volatile and less reliable for more recent periods since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been rendered 
accordingly  for the most recent months  the incurred claims are estimated from a trend analysis based on per member per month claims trends developed from the experience in preceding months 
this method is applied consistently year over year while assumptions may be adjusted to reflect changes in medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 

table of contents an extensive degree of actuarial judgment is used in this estimation process  considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  and the estimates are highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and payment patterns and medical cost trends 
as such  the completion factors and the claims per member per month trend factor are the most significant factors used in estimating our reserves for claims 
since a large portion of the reserves for claims is attributed in the most recent months  the estimated reserves for claims is highly sensitive to these factors 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by these factors completion factor a percentage point increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million medical cost trend b percentage point increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to the estimate of total claims for a given period 
therefore  an increase in completion factor percent results in a decrease in the remaining estimated reserves for claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trend used to estimate the per member per month cost for the most recent three months 
other relevant factors include exceptional situations that might require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims  such as system conversions  processing interruptions or changes  environmental changes or other factors 
all of these factors are used in estimating reserves for claims and are important to our reserve methodology in trending the claims per member per month for purposes of estimating the reserves for the most recent months 
in developing its best estimate of reserves for claims  we consistently apply the principles and methodology described above from year to year  while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors 
because reserves for claims includes various actuarially developed estimates  our actual health care services expense may be more or less than our previously developed estimates 
claims processing expenses are also accrued based on an estimate of expenses necessary to process such claims 
such reserves are continually monitored and reviewed  with any adjustments reflected in current operations 
hn of california  our california hmo  generally contracts with various medical groups to provide professional care to certain of its members on a capitated  or fixed per member per month fee basis 
capitation contracts generally include a provision for stop loss and non capitated services for which we are liable 
professional capitated contracts also generally contain provisions for shared risk 
we have risk sharing arrangements with certain of our providers related to approximately  members  primarily in the california commercial market 
shared risk arrangements provide for us to share with our providers the variance between actual costs and predetermined goals 
our health plans in connecticut  new jersey and new york market to small employer groups through a joint venture agreement with the guardian 
we have approximately  members under this agreement 
in general  we share equally with the guardian in the profits of the marketing agreement  subject to certain terms of the marketing agreement related to expenses 
on february   we announced that we were purchasing the guardian s interest in our joint venture 
see item business recent and other developments and other company information 

table of contents our hmos in other states also contract with hospitals  physicians and other providers of health care  pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements  hospital per diems  and case rates under which providers bill the hmos for each individual service provided to enrollees 
additionally  we contract with certain hospitals to provide hospital care to enrolled members on a capitation basis 
we assess the profitability of contracts for providing health care services when operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses 
significant factors that can lead to a change in our profitability estimates include premium yield and health care cost trend assumptions  risk share terms and non performance of a provider under a capitated agreement resulting in membership reverting to fee for service arrangements with other providers 
contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with the method of determining premium rates 
losses are determined by comparing anticipated premiums to estimates for the total of health care related costs less reinsurance recoveries  if any  and the cost of maintaining the contracts 
losses  if any  are recognized in the period the losses are determined and are classified as health plan services 
we held no premium deficiency reserves as of december  government contracts the tricare north region contract is made up of two major revenue components  health care and administrative services 
health care services revenue includes health care costs  including paid claims and estimated ibnr expenses  for care provided for which we are at risk and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
administrative services revenue encompasses all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contracts with the government 
health care costs and associated revenues are recognized as the costs are incurred and the associated revenue is earned 
revenue related to administrative services is recognized as the services are provided and earned 
revenues associated with the transition to the tricare contract for the north region are recognized over the entire term of the contract 
there are different variables that impact the estimate of the ibnr reserves for our tricare business than those that impact our managed care businesses 
these variables consist of changes in the level of our nation s military activity  including the call up of reservists in support of heightened military activity  continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries  changes in the health care facilities in which the eligible beneficiaries seek treatment  and revisions to the provisions of the contract in the form of change orders 
each of these factors is subject to significant judgment  and we have incorporated our best estimate of these factors in estimating the reserve for ibnr claims 
as part of our tricare contract for the north region  we have a risk sharing arrangement with the federal government whereby variances in actual claim experience from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid are shared 
due to this risk sharing arrangement provided for in the tricare contract for the north region  the changes in the estimate of the ibnr reserves are not expected to have a material effect on the favorable or adverse development of our liability under the tricare contract 
other government contracts revenues are recognized in the month in which the eligible beneficiaries are entitled to health care services or in the month in which the administrative services are performed or the period that coverage for services is provided 
revenue under the expired former region  region and regions  and contracts was subject to price adjustments attributable to inflation and other factors 
the effects of these adjustments were recognized on a monthly basis  with the final determination of these amounts occurring in under our tricare contract for the north region we recognize amounts receivable and payable under the government contracts related to estimated health care ibnr expenses which are reported separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  these amounts are the same since all of the estimated health care ibnr expenses incurred are offset by an equal amount of revenues earned 

table of contents some of the amounts receivable under government contracts are comprised primarily of price adjustments and change orders for services not originally specified in the contracts 
change orders arise because the government often directs us to implement changes to our contracts before the scope and or value is defined or negotiated 
we start to incur costs immediately  before we have proposed a price to the government 
in these situations  we make no attempt to estimate and record revenue 
our policy is to defer the costs as incurred until we have submitted a cost proposal to the government  at which time we will record the costs and the appropriate value for revenue  using our best estimate of what will ultimately be negotiated 
in the normal course of contracting with the federal government  we may make claims for contract and price adjustments arising from cost over runs against the government 
we recognize such claims when the amounts become determinable  supportable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
reserves for contingent liabilities in the course of our operations  we are involved on a routine basis in various disputes with members  health care providers  and other entities  as well as audits by government agencies that relate to our services and or business practices that expose us to potential losses 
we recognize an estimated loss  which may represent damages  settlement costs  future legal expenses or a combination of the foregoing  as appropriate  from such loss contingencies when it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our loss estimates are based in part on an analysis of potential results  the stage of the proceedings  consultation with outside counsel and any other relevant information available 
goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets arise primarily as a result of various business acquisitions and consist of identifiable intangible assets acquired and the excess of the cost of the acquisitions over the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets consist of the value of employer group contracts  provider networks and customer relationships 
we perform our annual impairment test on our recorded goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization as of june or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of these assets for each of our reporting units 
as a result of divestitures that occurred prior to and including  health plans services is our only reporting unit with goodwill as of december  and we test goodwill for impairment annually based on the estimated fair value of our health plan services reporting unit 
we test for impairment on a more frequent basis in cases where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of goodwill 
our measurement of fair value is based on the income approach to fair value determination 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology is based upon converting expected cash flows to present value 
annual cash flows are estimated for each year of a defined multi year period until the growth pattern becomes stable 
the interim cash flows expected after the growth pattern becomes stable are calculated using an appropriate capitalization technique and then discounted 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair value of our reporting units  including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings and membership levels based on current and future plans and initiatives  long term strategies and our annual planning and forecasting process as well as the weighted average cost of capital used in the discounting process 
if these planned initiatives do not accomplish their targeted objectives  the assumptions and estimates underlying the goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected and have a material effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents recoverability of long lived assets and investments we periodically assess the recoverability of our long lived assets including property and equipment and other long term assets and investments where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value as follows long lived assets held and used we test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
if we identify an indicator of impairment  we assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
long lived assets held for sale long lived assets are classified as held for sale as part of current assets when certain criteria are met  which include management commitment to a plan to sell the assets  the availability of the assets for immediate sale in their present condition  whether an active program to locate buyers and other actions to sell the assets have been initiated  whether the sale of the assets is probable and their transfer is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year  whether the assets are being marketed at reasonable prices in relation to their fair value and how unlikely it is that significant changes will be made to the plan to sell the assets 
we measure long lived assets to be disposed of by sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value is determined using quoted market prices or the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale we classify an asset or asset group that will be disposed of other than by sale as held and used until the disposal transaction occurs 
the asset or asset group continues to be depreciated based on revisions to its estimated useful life until the date of disposal or abandonment 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the remaining period of use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits from our deferred tax assets only when an analysis of both positive and negative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 

table of contents we file tax returns in many tax jurisdictions and  often  application of tax rules within the various jurisdictions is subject to differing interpretation 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that it is probable certain positions will be challenged by taxing authorities  and we may not prevail on the positions as filed 
accordingly  we maintain a reserve for the estimated amount of contingent tax challenges by taxing authorities upon examination  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the reserve is comprised of amounts for specific issues arising in periods subject to examination  and amounts are released from the reserve upon closure of such examinations or upon closure of the statute of limitations for assessment 
the estimates of contingent tax costs comprising the reserve balance have been developed after careful analysis of the applicable statutory authority and court case precedent 
as such  we believe that the reserve reflects the probable outcome of contingent tax challenges and that the probability of material assessments above the reserve balance is remote 
the reserve is included in accounts payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertain taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation requires us to analyze the amount at which each tax position meets a more likely than not standard for sustainability upon examination by taxing authorities 
only tax benefit amounts meeting or exceeding this standard will be reflected in tax provision expense and deferred tax asset balances 
the interpretation also requires that any differences between the amounts of tax benefits reported on tax returns and tax benefits reported in the financial statements be recorded in a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is reported separately from deferred tax assets and liabilities and classified as current or noncurrent based upon the expected period of payment 
additional disclosure in the footnotes to the audited financial statements will be required concerning the income tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits  any interest and penalties related to taxes that are included in the financial statements  and open statutes of limitations for examination by major tax jurisdictions 
fin is effective for annual periods beginning after december  and any cumulative effect of adopting fin will be recorded as a change in accounting principle in the financial statements for the three months ended march  we anticipate the impact to be an immaterial reduction to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and market risk primarily due to our investing and borrowing activities 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and in equity prices 
interest rate risk is a consequence of maintaining variable interest rate earning investments and fixed rate liabilities or fixed income investments and variable rate liabilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risks arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  prepayment speeds and or the shape and slope of the yield curve 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential that changes in an issuer s credit rating or credit perception may affect the value of financial instruments 
we have several bond portfolios to fund reserves 
we attempt to manage the interest rate risks related to our investment portfolios by actively managing the asset liability duration of our investment portfolios 
the overall goal for the investment portfolios is to provide a source of liquidity and support the ongoing operations of our business units 
our philosophy is to actively manage assets to maximize total return over a multiple year time horizon  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
each business unit has additional requirements with respect to liquidity  current income and contribution to surplus 
we manage these risks by setting risk tolerances  targeting asset class allocations  diversifying among assets and asset characteristics  and using performance measurement and reporting 
we use a value at risk var model  which follows a variance co variance methodology  to assess the market risk for our investment portfolio 
var is a method of assessing investment risk that uses standard 
table of contents statistical techniques to measure the worst expected loss in the portfolio over an assumed portfolio disposition period under normal market conditions 
the determination is made at a given statistical confidence level 
we assumed a portfolio disposition period of days with a confidence level of for the computation of var for the computation further assumes that the distribution of returns is normal 
based on such methodology and assumptions  the computed var was approximately million as of december  our calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that could be recognized on our investment portfolios assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and are not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our investment portfolios during the year 
we had used interest rate swap contracts as a part of our hedging strategy to manage certain exposures related to the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our senior notes 
under the swap contracts  we paid an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times a notional principal amount and received in return an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
the swap contracts were entered into with a number of major financial institutions in order to reduce counterparty credit risk 
on september   we terminated the swap contracts and recognized a loss of million associated with the termination and settlement of the swap contracts 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the swap contracts 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility  of which there were none as of december   are subject to variable interest rates 
for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our floating rate borrowings  if any  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interest rates paid on these borrowings  if any  are based on prevailing market rates 
borrowings under our term loan agreement  which were million as of december   are at variable interest rates 
for additional information regarding our term loan agreement  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the interest rate under our million bridge loan agreement was fixed for the initial day duration of the loan thereunder 
on september   we entered into an amendment to the bridge loan agreement to  among other things  extend the final maturity date of the bridge loan to march  the interest rate on the bridge loan at december  was 
we currently expect to repay amounts outstanding under the bridge loan agreement with a draw on the revolving credit facility 
for additional information regarding our bridge loan agreement  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents the fair value of our variable rate borrowings as of december  was approximately million  which is equal to the carrying value because the interest rates paid on these borrowings are based on prevailing market rates
