founded in  pervasive is headquartered in austin  texas  with international offices in brussels  frankfurt  london  paris and a joint venture in japan 
in july  we formed a business venture with ag tech corporation  a company developing  selling and importing packaged software  to sell and support our products in japan 
ag tech has been engaged in the sales and support of btrieve predecessor to pervasive psql and pervasive psql products since in conjunction with the joint venture  ag tech launched a new operating division staffed with specialists experienced in selling and supporting pervasive psql to assume responsibility for oem sales  packaged software sales  technical support and localization and translation of our products into japanese 
in connection with the new business venture  we obtained a less than ownership interest in ag tech and the ability to elect one director to the ag tech board of directors 
we do not have the ability to significantly influence or control the operations of ag tech and therefore  account for our investment in ag tech on the cost method of accounting

table of contents 
index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales returns and bad debt reserves goodwill and other intangible assets stock based compensation expense taxes revenue recognition we license our software through oem license agreements with software developers  or isvs and through shrink wrap software licenses  sold through isvs  value added resellers  or vars  systems integrators and distributors  or direct to end users 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
revenues related to oem license agreements involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees are generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
per copy royalties related to oem license agreements in excess of a fixed minimum amount are recognized as revenue when such amounts are reported to us 
revenue from post contract support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades is recognized ratably over the contract term 
we generally provide telephone support to customers and end users in the days immediately following the sale at no additional charge and at a minimal cost per call 
we accrue the cost of providing this support 
revenue from consulting services and training is recognized when the related services are performed 
we enter into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return product in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
revenue from shipping and handling is recognized at the shipping date 
shipping and handling costs are included in costs of product license revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
where software licenses are sold with maintenance or other services  we allocate the total fee to the various elements based on the fair values of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we do not have vsoe for one of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but do have vsoe for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the undelivered elements based upon their vsoe of fair value  the remaining arrangement fee  including any discount  is allocated to the delivered element 
if the residual method is not used  discounts  if any  are applied proportionately to each element included in the arrangement based on each element s fair value without regard to the discount 
sales returns and bad debt reserves we reserve the cost of estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights as well as uncollectible accounts based on experience 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of the reserve for sales returns  stock rotation and price protection 
because these reserves are based on our judgments and estimates  our reserves may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net sales could be adversely affected 
goodwill and other intangible assets we assess whether goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are impaired on an annual basis 
upon determining the existence of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles exceeds its fair value 
the fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstance that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles has been impaired 
stock based compensation expense we account for employee share based compensation costs  to include stock options and restricted stock  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r and staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock option compensation at the date of grant  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
historical volatility was used in estimating the fair value of our share based awards rather than implied volatility  while the expected life was estimated to be four years based on historical trends since our initial public offering 
further  as required under sfas r  we now estimate forfeitures for options granted  which are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
the estimated fair value is charged to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally four years 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options having no vesting restrictions and being fully transferable 
accordingly  our estimate of fair value may not represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially impacts our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 
taxes under the liability method of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
prior to fiscal year  we had concluded that a valuation allowance was required for all periods presented to the extent that we do not anticipate the ability to utilize a portion of the deferred tax assets 
in fiscal years and  we again considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  and we were able to determine that we expect to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the cumulative amount of million 
further  our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to potential expiration if not utilized by certain dates in the future 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are frequently under audit by tax authorities in various jurisdictions 
accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we have recorded a liability for our best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years  based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter  which matters result primarily from intercompany transfer pricing 
although we believe our recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain  therefore our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
due to the complexity involved  we are not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded

in addition  the decreases in fiscal years and were due in part to reduced customer demand within our installed base of customers for the latest version of our database product version released march 
our embedded database and related products represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year in addition  we believe the integration 
table of contents

our integration products represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year a continued reduction in our embedded database business  or our inability to grow our integration products business  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition

the decrease in international revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributed to a decline in our embedded database revenue in europe 
the decrease in international revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributed to a decline in our embedded database revenue in japan 
we expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
costs and expenses cost of product licenses revenues 
cost of product licenses revenues consists primarily of the cost to manufacture and fulfill orders for our shrink wrap software products  payment of license fees for third party technologies embedded in our products and amortization of purchased technology 
cost of product licenses revenues was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues respectively 
cost of product licenses revenue in fiscal year was consistent with fiscal year the increase in cost of product licenses revenue in fiscal year is primarily the result of the write off of various purchased technologies during the year in the amount of million 
we anticipate that cost of product licenses revenue in fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year  excluding the write offs of purchased technologies 
cost of services and other revenues 
cost of services and other revenues consists primarily of the cost to provide technical support  primarily telephone support  which is typically provided within days of purchase  and the costs to deliver professional services and training services to others 
cost of services and other revenues was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
cost of services and other revenues increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of the requirement to record stock based compensation expense under fas r beginning on july  cost of services and other revenues decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of a reduction in costs related to support and professional service personnel 
we anticipate that cost of services and other revenues in fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  foreign sales office expenses  travel and entertainment  marketing programs and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively

table of contents 
index to financial statements stock based compensation expense under fas r beginning on july  sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to a reduction in costs related to sales and marketing personnel and a reduction in marketing program costs

research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel salaries and other costs of our finance  human resources and administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal year  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased in dollar amount in fiscal year primarily as a result of the requirement to record stock based compensation expense under fas r beginning on july  general and administrative expenses decreased in dollar amount in fiscal year primarily as a result of a reduction in costs associated with executive management personnel and a corresponding reduction in fas r stock option expense 
we believe our general and administrative expenses will continue to decrease in fiscal year due to the full year effect of reductions of executive management personnel during fiscal year management restructuring charges 
we announced certain senior management changes effective january   including the replacement of our former president and chief executive officer  david sikora  with john farr  who previously served as our chief financial officer 
our vice president of corporate development and vice president of marketing also left the company during the quarter

income tax benefit was approximately million in fiscal the provision for income taxes in fiscal consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign operations 
the income tax benefit in fiscal consists primarily of the effect of a change in our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset in the amount of million  offset partially by provision for income taxes related to foreign operations 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal year consists of income taxes related to both our foreign and domestic operations  offset partially by a change in our valuation allowance

as a result  a drop in near term demand for our products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
in the future  our operating results may fluctuate for this reason or as a result of a number of other factors  including increased expenses  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of sales  announcements of new products by us or our competitors and capital spending patterns of our customers 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly basis

cash provided by operations increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal year primarily due to an increase in income before taxes  non cash amortization and write offs of purchased technology intangible assets  a decrease in trade accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in belgium  germany  france and england and a joint venture in japan  and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income of less than million 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in revenue and operating income of approximately million

the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of all other currencies for fiscal  and was not material 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and  from time to time  will attempt to reduce exposure through hedging 
gains and losses on foreign currency hedging were not material to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended june    and as such hedging activities were minimal 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our cash and marketable securities investments  however  this risk is limited as our investment policy requires us to invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less
