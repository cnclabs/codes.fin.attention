we make best use of our engineering capabilities by sharing research and production methods across our divisions and  where appropriate  assigning engineers to the same project  regardless of the facility that incurs the personnel expense 
our manufacturing management team has also been reorganized to increase efficiency 
capacity optimization enhancement program in  we commenced our capacity optimization enhancement program to increase company wide capacity utilization and operating efficiencies through consolidations and realignments of operations 
phase i we started phase i of the capacity optimization enhancement program in fiscal year  which included the closure of most of our operations in watertown  massachusetts and relocation of those operations to other microsemi plants in lawrence and lowell  massachusetts and scottsdale  arizona and the closure of the melrose  massachusetts facility and relocation of those operations to lawrence  massachusetts 
we completed phase i in at a total cost of  phase ii in october  we announced the consolidation of our operations in santa ana  california santa ana into operations in garden grove  california garden grove and scottsdale  arizona scottsdale 
santa ana had approximately employees and occupied  square feet in two facilities  including  square feet in owned facilities and  square feet in facilities that are leased by us from a third party under a year capital lease 
santa ana accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal  scottsdale began to ship all products that had previously been shipped by santa ana 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we started to consolidate the remainder of our operations in watertown  massachusetts watertown 
we moved production to our facilities in scottsdale and lowell  massachusetts lowell 
we completed phase ii in at a total cost of phase iii in april  we announced the consolidation of operations in broomfield  colorado broomfield into other microsemi facilities and the closure of the manufacturing operations of microsemi corp 
ireland ireland in ennis  ireland 
in may we announced that that we will retain our manufacturing operations in ennis  ireland to meet the increasing demand for our high reliability defense and commercial air satellite products 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we reversed accruals for severance totaling  the following table reflects the activities related to the consolidation of broomfield and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the date below amounts in thousands employee severance other related costs total provisions   cash expenditures balance at october    provisions cash expenditures   balance at october  provisions cash expenditures balance at september    in the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded estimated severance payments of  in accordance with fas the severance payments cover approximately employees  including management positions 
severance payments commenced in the second quarter of fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded  for other restructuring related expenses  primarily for travel  planning and equipment relocation  in accordance with fas other consolidation associated costs such as inventory  workforce reduction  relocation and reorganization charges have been and will be reported  when incurred  as restructuring costs in accordance with fas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  fas or fas inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  as applicable 
the consolidation of broomfield is expected to result  subsequent to its completion  in annual cost savings of million to million from the elimination of redundant facilities and related expenses and employee reductions 
costs associated with the consolidation of broomfield are estimated to range from million to million  excluding any gain or loss from future dispositions of the plant and property 
broomfield has approximately employees and occupies a  square foot owned facility 
broomfield shipped approximately  and of net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we currently anticipate that broomfield will continue operations through fiscal year to service customer requirements in the medical end market 
the decision to continue limited production in broomfield also supports more rapid development of devices that we expect will provide higher microsemi content 
in february  advanced power technology  inc apt announced the planned closure of its facility in montgomeryville  pennsylvania and the relocation of remaining manufacturing activities to its santa clara  california facility 
microsemi acquired apt  which was renamed microsemi corp 
power products group ppg in july and determined that the fair value of the restructuring liability at the time of acquisition was  we did not substantially modify the restructuring plan subsequent to the acquisition 
in fiscal year  we recorded  in additional severance expense in accordance with fas and  in lease termination fees 
the lease termination was not contemplated at the time of the acquisition of ppg 
the following table reflects restructuring activities at ppg and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance other related costs total balance at april  provisions cash expenditures balance at october  provisions cash expenditures balance at september  in fiscal year  in accordance with fas  we recorded  in severance expense incurred in integrating existing microsemi operations with powerdsine 
the severance payments cover approximately employees and substantially all payments were made by the end of fiscal year acquisition on october   we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with powerdsine ltd 
powerdsine  an israeli corporation  and pinnacle acquisition corporation  ltd  an israeli corporation that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of microsemi 
the merger agreement provided for a merger of our subsidiary into powerdsine 
we completed the acquisition of powerdsine on january  and under the terms of the merger agreement  we issued of a share of microsemi common stock and paid in cash for each powerdsine ordinary share  resulting in the issuance in the aggregate of approximately million shares with a fair market value of approximately million  based on microsemi s average closing price between october  and october  and a cash payment of approximately million 
we converted equity awards issued by powerdsine and valued vested awards at million 
direct transaction fees and expenses were million and an additional million was placed into escrow for the cash consideration on converted unvested powerdsine restricted share awards 
this amount will be paid to employees as their restricted share awards vest 
a further million in transaction costs were accrued by powerdsine prior to the acquisition and subsequently paid by microsemi 
we financed this transaction with cash on hand and through additional borrowings of approximately million on our credit line 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
information with respect to our critical accounting policies which we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments is contained herein 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances we recognize revenue to all customers  including distributors  when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for substantially all sales  revenues are recognized at the time the product is shipped to customers 
we enter into contracts with certain distributors and these contracts permit very limited stock rotation returns 
we provides an estimated allowance for such returns  and corresponding reductions in revenue are concurrently recorded  based on several factors including past history and notification from customers of pending returns 
actual returns have been within management s expectations 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  estimated reductions to revenue are also recorded for customer incentive programs consisting of price protection and volume purchase rebates 
such programs are limited and actual reductions to revenues have been within management s expectations 
we generally provide a one year product defect warranty from the date of sale 
historically  warranty costs have been nominal and have been within management s expectations 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
the accounts receivable amounts shown in the balance sheet are trade account receivable balances at the respective dates  net of allowance for possible returns and doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on our historical write off experience and specifically identified accounts 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
with the exception of one distributor who entered into bankruptcy and for whom we charged off approximately million against the allowance for doubtful accounts in fiscal  actual bad debt has been within our expectations and the provisions established  and has been consistent with experience of prior years  however  any unexpected significant adverse change in the financial position of any of our major customers or any group of customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate the carrying value of our inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price we expect to obtain for our products in their respective markets 
we also evaluate the composition of our inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete products 
the total evaluations require material management judgments  including estimates of future sales  continuing market acceptance of our products  and market and economic conditions 
additionally  inventory reserves are established based upon such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than their cost  which is further reduced by related selling expenses 
historically  the net realizable value of our inventories has generally been within management s estimates 
however  if we are unable to meet our sales expectations  or if market conditions deteriorate from management s estimates  reductions in the net realizable value of our inventories could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 
significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
an evaluation under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will recognize an impairment loss which equals to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenues and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
goodwill we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas at the beginning of fiscal year  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  while those intangible assets with known useful lives have continued to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred  we are required to reassess goodwill 
whenever we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we will record an impairment charge against earnings  which equals the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its then fair value  and a reduction in goodwill on our balance sheet 
the identification of intangible assets and determination of the fair value and useful lives are subjective in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets can significantly affect net income 
we performed our annual review for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that no impairment existed 
accounting for income taxes we record a liability for potential tax assessments based on our estimate of the potential exposure 
new laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates 
to the extent our estimates differ from actual payments or assessments  income tax expense is adjusted 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we have a nexus 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we have established a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets 
if we increase any valuation allowance in a period  it will adversely affect the tax provision in the income statement 
on october   president bush signed into law the working families tax relief act of the act 
the act retroactively extended the expiration date of the research tax credit from june  to december  since the credit was reinstated after september   the last day of our fiscal year  we recognized credits from september  through june  in fiscal year and we recognized the retroactive reinstatement of the credit from july  through september  was recognized in the first quarter of the fiscal year in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities by the american jobs creation act of fsp fas no 
and fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of fsp fas no 

the american jobs creation act of ajca provides several incentives for us multinational corporations and us manufacturers  subject to certain limitations 
the incentives include an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations that repatriate accumulated income abroad  and a deduction for domestic qualified production activities taxable income 
we did not repatriate income from abroad because it would not have resulted in significant benefits 
stock based compensation effective at the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
share based payment fas r to account for stock based compensation under the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  fair value of new and previously granted but unvested stock options are recognized as compensation expense in the income statement  and prior period results are not restated 
under fas r  we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is net of an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre vesting forfeiture rate and an option s expected life 
the financial statements include amounts that are based on our best estimates and judgments 
in august  we announced that we would accelerate the vesting of certain unvested stock options  all previously awarded to eligible participants under our stock plan  as amended 
upon our planned adoption of fas r  effective for fiscal year  vesting of unvested options will add to our compensation expense 
therefore  we accelerated vesting into fiscal year before the new accounting rule took effect 
we have imposed substantial restrictions on all shares issued under the accelerated options 
these restrictions prevent the selling of any shares acquired upon the exercise of accelerated options except as necessary to cover the exercise price and satisfy taxes until the date on which such options would have vested under their original vesting schedule 
as a result of this vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock became vested and exercisable on september   including approximately million shares held by executive officers 
the intrinsic value of the accelerated options is approximately million  of which million relate to options held by executive officers 
compensation expense that would have been recorded absent the accelerated vesting was approximately million  of which approximately million would have been in fiscal year in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million non cash compensation charge as a result of the accelerated vesting related to the excess of the fair market value of our common stock over the option exercise price on the acceleration date of those options that would have been forfeited had the vesting not been accelerated 
in determining the forfeiture rates  we reviewed the impact of divisions that were previously sold or consolidated  one time events that are not expected to recur and whether options were held by our executive officers 
results of operations for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year net sales increased million or from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year 
estimated sales by end markets are based on our understanding of end market uses of our products 
an estimated breakout of net sales by end markets for and is approximately as follows amounts in thousands commercial air space   defense   industrial semicap   medical   mobile connectivity   notebook lcd tv display   sales in the commercial air space end market increased million from million in to million in the increase was driven by strong demand and order rates for commercial aircraft at aircraft manufacturers and tier one suppliers  as well as growing electronic content in current aircraft 
additionally  we believe that demand for commercial satellites and radar systems is strong  especially with higher planned launch levels and expansion of airports in asia 
sales in the defense end market increased million from million in to million in sales in this end market continued to be solid during  based on the strength of new programs  including military avionics  ground transportation  surveillance equipment  joint service communications systems  naval vessels  radars  missiles and advanced combat unit electronics  as well as the full year contribution from ppg  which we acquired in the third quarter of based on growing backlog and continued increases in both domestic and international defense spending  we expect to see increasing sales in this end market 
in addition  we expect that our price position programs will have a favorable impact beginning around the second or third quarter of fiscal year sales in the industrial semicap market increased million from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to contributions from ppg  which we acquired in the third quarter of we are seeing several emerging alternative energy applications for our products but also see significant weakness in the semiconductor capital equipment market that could last for several quarters 
sales in the medical end market increased million  from million in to million in the full year contributions of ppg in from mri business and an improving defibrillator business were the primary drivers for this increase 
increasing functionality and device integration in the implantable medical devices such as defibrillators and pacemakers have resulted in increases in both dollars per unit and unit content per device 
while the implantable medical device business slowed compared to the prior year third quarter  based on our current bookings and expected government approvals of our customers products  we expect the implantable medical business to continue to strengthen in upcoming quarters 
sales in the mobile connectivity end market increased million  from million in to million in sales in this end market have grown due primarily to the addition of contributions from powerdsine  which we acquired in the second quarter of we expect to see continued strength in this market particularly in n products 
we are also seeing wi max shipments  which is emerging as a key future market for us and for which we have multiple solutions targeting this application 
sales in the notebook lcd television display end market decreased million  from million in to million in declines in hard disk drive and notebook demand  as well as some lower margin business that we exited  contributed to the decrease 
the weakness was partially offset by strong lcd tv market demand 
this market is expected to improve as the industry demand increases and new products ramp early in the next fiscal year 
an estimated breakout of net sales by originating geographic area for and is approximately as follows amounts in thousands united states   europe   asia   total   between fiscal years and  we shifted more originating sales through our asian locations than through our locations in the united states 
sales originating in asia also increased due to the contributions of powerdsine  which we acquired in the second quarter of between fiscal years and  sales originating in europe increased  due to shipments from ppg s facility in europe that we acquired in the third quarter of and due to increased shipments from our ireland facility 
gross profit increased million  from million of sales for to million of sales for the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the addition of ppg and powerdsine and offset primarily by costs associated with transferring and consolidating manufacturing operations of approximately million in versus million in in  cost of sales included million related to the expensing of manufacturing profit in acquired inventory as inventory acquired in the powerdsine acquisition was sold to customers 
in  cost of sales included million related to the expensing of manufacturing profit in acquired inventory which was incurred as inventory acquired in the ppg acquisition was sold to customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from million for to million for the primary increases were approximately million related to the addition of ppg and powerdsine operations  and an increase in stock based compensation expense of million 
we also charged million in bad debt expense related to the bankruptcy of one distributor 
research and development expense increased million from million in to million in  primarily due to the addition of research and development expense incurred at ppg and powerdsine 
the principal focus of our research and development activities has been to improve processes and to develop new products that support the growth of our businesses 
the spending on research and development was principally to develop new higher margin application specific products  including  among others  poe  ccfl and led drivers  class d audio amplifiers  ingap rf power amplifiers for wireless lan applications  development and adoption of silicon carbide technology  vdmos products for high frequency communications and s band products for rf applications 
we incurred a million charge from the powerdsine acquisition and million charge from the ppg acquisition for in process research and development ipr d in and  respectively 
ipr d represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by purchased technologies that  as of the acquisition dates  had not yet reached technological feasibility  and was thus immediately expensed 
the ipr d projects associated with the powerdsine acquisition were valued through the application of discounted cash flow analyses  taking into account key characteristics of each technology including its future prospects  the rate of technological change in the industry  product life cycles  risks specific to the project  and the project s stage of completion 
stage of completion was estimated by considering the time  cost  and complexity of tasks completed prior to the acquisition  versus the project s overall expected cost  effort and risks required for achieving technological feasibility 
in the application of the discounted cash flow analyses  powerdsine s management provided a revenue forecast for each ipr d project 
the projection was based on the expected date of market introduction  an assessment of customer needs  the expected pricing and cost structure of the related products  product life cycles  and the importance of existing technology relative to the in process technology 
in addition  the costs expected to complete the project were added to the operating expenses to calculate the operating income for each ipr d project 
as certain other assets contribute to the cash flow attributable to the assets being valued  returns to these other assets were calculated and deducted from the pre tax operating income to isolate the economic benefit solely attributable to each of the in process technologies 
the present value of ipr d was calculated based on discount rates recommended by the american institute of certified public accountants ipr d practice aid  which depends on the stage of completion and the additional risk associated with the completion of the ipr d project 
the earnings associated with the incomplete technologies were discounted at a rate of  two percentage points higher than the powerdsine s cost of capital 
amortization expense of intangible assets increased million from million in to million in from amortization expense on intangible assets acquired in the ppg and powerdsine acquisitions 
interest expense was million higher in versus primarily due to interest expense on borrowings from our credit facility for temporary funding of the powerdsine acquisition 
the income tax rate was in  primarily due to the non deductibility of acquisition related charges such as in process research and development and other transactions related to the powerdsine acquisition 
these charges increased the income tax rate by percentage points 
capital resources and liquidity in  we financed our operations with cash from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net income in of million included a non cash acquisition related ipr d charge of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million as well as changes in accounts receivable  inventories  other current assets and current liabilities  as described below 
in addition  we paid million of acquisition related transaction costs that were accrued by powerdsine prior to the acquisition 
accounts receivable increased million from million at october  to million at september  the increase in receivables was due primarily to our acquisition of powerdsine and increase in net sales 
inventories increased million from million at october  to million at september  inventory increased primarily due to higher inventory levels to support higher anticipated net sales and inventory that was moved to a higher stocking position on certain high reliability parts  but was also impacted by our acquisition of powerdsine 
other current assets  including assets held for disposition  increased million  from million at october  to million at september  the increase was due to higher prepaid balances  primarily in income taxes and deposits for equipment  and the impact of the powerdsine acquisition and offset by the sale of a facility in santa ana  california that was classified in assets held for disposition at october  current liabilities increased million from million at october  to million at september  the increase was due to our acquisition of powerdsine  partially offset by the reversal of restructuring related severance accruals for our ireland facility and payments of income tax and severance 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
primarily consisted of million of powerdsine acquisition costs  net of cash acquired  the purchase of property and equipment and the transfer of cash into an escrow account related to converted unvested powerdsine restricted share awards 
these amounts were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of investments in marketable securities of million and the sale of two properties for million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease of million related primarily to a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises and the related tax benefits 
we had million and million in cash and cash equivalents at october  and september   respectively 
current ratios were to and to at october  and september   respectively 
we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of december  with comerica bank the revolving credit agreement or the new credit facility 
the new credit facility s stated maturity date is january  the new credit facility replaces the company s existing million credit agreement dated july   as amended  which had a stated maturity date of march  terminated credit agreement 
proceeds of borrowing under the new credit facility can be used for working capital and other lawful corporate purposes  and initial borrowings were used to finance a portion of the company s acquisition of powerdsine ltd 
interest accruing on the amount of each revolving borrowing under the new credit facility is determined based upon the company s choice of either a prime based advance or eurodollar based advance 
prime based advances incur interest at a rate equal to the prime rate  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  less basis points 
if the company elects a eurodollar based advance  the borrowing bears interest at the eurodollar based rate  also defined in the revolving credit agreement  which is determined  in part  by an applicable margin that fluctuates with the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio 
financial covenants  which include for example maintaining i a minimum ebitda and ii a maximum funded debt to ebitda ratio  establish both conditions and current limitations on available amounts of borrowings 
that maximum that may be borrowed is million  but the amount actually available to us for borrowing at any given time could be less than the amount stated 
as of september   there were no amounts outstanding on the new credit facility and million was outstanding in the form of a letter of credit and million was available under the new credit facility 
as of september   we were in compliance with the financial covenants required by our credit facility 
as of september   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
on october   we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with powerdsine ltd 
powerdsine  an israeli corporation  and pinnacle acquisition corporation  ltd  an israeli corporation that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of microsemi 
the merger agreement provided for a merger of our subsidiary into powerdsine 
we completed the acquisition of powerdsine on january  and under the terms of the merger agreement  we issued of a share of microsemi common stock and paid in cash for each powerdsine ordinary share  resulting in the issuance in the aggregate of approximately million shares with a fair market value of approximately million  based on microsemi s average closing price between october  and october  and a cash payment of approximately million 
we converted equity awards issued by powerdsine and valued vested awards at million 
direct transaction fees and expenses were million and an additional million was placed into escrow for the cash consideration on converted unvested powerdsine restricted share awards 
this amount will be paid to employees as their restricted share awards vest 
a further million in transaction costs were accrued by powerdsine prior to the acquisition and subsequently paid by microsemi 
we financed this transaction with cash on hand and through additional borrowings of approximately million on our credit line 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by period amounts in thousands total less than year years years more than years imputed interest capital leases    operating leases      purchase obligations    other long term liabilities   total       based upon information currently available to us  we believe that we can meet our cash requirements and capital commitments in the foreseeable future with cash balances  internally generated funds from ongoing operations and  if necessary  from the available line of credit 
results of operations for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year net sales increased million or from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year 
sales by end markets  including sales through distributors  are based on our understanding of end market uses of our products 
an estimated breakout of net sales by end markets for and is as follows amounts in thousands commercial air space   defense   industrial semicap   medical   mobile connectivity   notebook lcd tv display   sales in the commercial air space end market increased million from million in to million in the increase was driven by strong demand for commercial aircraft in asia and in north america by low cost carriers driving increased order rates from aircraft manufacturers 
additionally  demand for commercial satellites and radar systems were particularly robust 
the ppg acquisition contributed million to our growth in this end market 
sales in the defense end market increased million from million in to million in the ppg acquisition contributed million to our growth in this end market  especially in airborne radar and avionics applications 
this increase was also driven by higher defense spending 
other factors contributing to the increase in revenues were favorable contract negotiations  product mix shift towards higher reliability components which generally have higher selling prices  strategic price positioning in certain product lines 
sales in the industrial semicap market increased million from million in to million in  due largely to the acquisition of ppg with its switching products for semiconductor capital equipment markets 
the ppg acquisition contributed million to our growth in this end market 
other areas of growth were in solar inverters  inductive heating  welding applications and switch mode power supplies 
sales in the medical end market increased million  from million in to million in sales were up slightly driven by strength in our mri business 
while the implantable medical device business slowed during  primarily due to implantable cardioverter defibrillator product recalls  increasing functionality and device integration in the implantable medical devices such as defibrillators and pacemakers has resulted in increases in both dollar and unit content per device 
sales in the mobile connectivity end market increased million  from million in to million in sales in this end market grew consistently due to market acceptance of new power amplifier introductions 
we have successfully transitioned into our fourth generation of and gigahertz power amplifiers for the a b g and n markets 
this market had growth due to additional products addressing set top box and telecommunication market applications using switching and dc dc products 
sales in the notebook  lcd television and displays end market decreased million  from million in to million in we saw decreases due to our decision to exit certain lower margin business  primarily related to automotive displays 
in contrast  we saw increases due primarily to higher shipments of our lighting product solutions to notebook computer and lcd television manufacturers as well as devices for storage applications 
the lcd television market continued to gain momentum in the and greater display size where our products are strongly positioned 
additionally  we saw significant growth in generic lighting displays  particularly in point of sale terminals

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and stock market 
we are exposed to various market risks  related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we conduct a relatively small portion of our business in a number of foreign currencies  principally the european union euro  british pound  israeli shekel and chinese rmb 
we may receive some revenues in foreign currencies and purchase some inventory and services in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
transactions in foreign currencies have represented a relatively small portion of our business 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on our revenues or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have material adverse effects on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
we have not conducted a foreign currency hedging program thus far 
we have and may continue to consider the adoption of a foreign currency hedging program 
we did not enter into derivative financial instruments and did not enter into any other financial instruments for trading  speculative purposes or to manage our interest rate risk 
our other financial instruments consist primarily of cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and long term obligations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these instruments 
we do not engage in transactions intended to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of december  with comerica bank the revolving credit agreement or the new credit facility 
the new credit facility s stated maturity date is january  the new credit facility replaces the company s existing million credit agreement dated july   as amended  which had a stated maturity date of march  terminated credit agreement 
proceeds of borrowing under the new credit facility can be used for working capital and other lawful corporate purposes  and initial borrowings were used to finance a portion of our acquisition of powerdsine ltd 
interest accruing on the amount of each revolving borrowing under the new credit facility is determined based upon our choice of either a prime based advance or eurodollar based advance 
prime based advances incur interest at a rate equal to the prime rate  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  less basis points 
if we elect a eurodollar based advance  the borrowing bears interest at the eurodollar based rate  also defined in the revolving credit agreement  which is determined  in part  by an applicable margin that fluctuates with our funded debt to ebitda ratio 
financial covenants  which include for example maintaining i a minimum ebitda and ii a maximum funded debt to ebitda ratio  establish both conditions and current limitations on available amounts of borrowings 
the maximum that may be borrowed is million  but the amount actually available to us for borrowing at any given time could be less than the amount stated 
as of september   there were no amounts outstanding on the new credit facility and million was outstanding in the form of a letter of credit and million was available under the new credit facility 
as of september   we were in compliance with the financial covenants required by our credit facility
