this review was completed and on october   the special committee presented its report to the company s board of directors 
the review of stock option grants and procedures identified various deficiencies in the process of granting and documenting stock options and restricted shares described below

 accounting for stock issued to employees  for annual option grant dates  monthly grant dates and special grant dates revisions of annual  monthly and special grant dates have no accounting impact because prices on the revised dates were lower than on the measurement dates previously recorded by the company

for fiscal  the company recorded million of expense related to the revised measurement dates 
the company s board of directors also approved a remediation program intended to protect over  employees from certain potential adverse tax consequences 
these adverse tax consequences arise pursuant to internal revenue code section a as a result of historical deficiencies associated with certain of the company s stock option grants that were disclosed through the company s stock option review 
as a result of this program  the company made cash payments totaling approximately million to over  employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which resulted in a non recurring  pre tax stock based compensation charge 
the cash outlay primarily represents payments to employees in connection with increasing the exercise prices on certain stock option grants so as to protect them from certain potential adverse tax consequences 
no executive officer received such payments 
the company believes it is likely the company will recoup a substantial portion of the anticipated cash outlay over the next several years through higher proceeds from future stock option exercises  although this recovery would not flow through the income statement 
the company also filed a form k dated december  which provides further details regarding the remediation program 
the company continues to cooperate with the informal inquiry of the sec regarding the company s stock option grant practices 
in addition  the company is also cooperating with the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey in connection with its inquiry into such matters 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in particular  judgment is used in areas such as the inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets  accruals for self insurance  litigation  store opening  expansion  relocation and closing costs  stock based compensation and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory costs for bbb and harmon are calculated using the retail inventory method and inventory cost for cts is calculated using the first in  first out cost method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
at any one time  inventories include items that have been written down to the company s best estimate of their realizable value 
judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand 
actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions 
the company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year  based on historical shrinkage 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the company s physical inventory count 
historically  the company s shrinkage has not been volatile 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets the company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value 
the company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets 
in the future  if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired  the company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs 
self insurance the company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability and employee related health care benefits a portion of which is paid by its employees 
liabilities associated with the risks that the company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
although the company s claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past  actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future 
factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to inflation  the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes 
in the future  if the company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required  the liability will be adjusted accordingly 
litigation the company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel  where appropriate 
as additional information becomes available  the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates  as appropriate 
the ultimate resolution of these ongoing matters as a result of future developments could have a material impact on the company s earnings 
the company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future  and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings 
store opening  expansion  relocation and closing costs store opening  expansion  relocation and closing costs  including markdowns  asset residual values and projected occupancy costs  are charged to earnings as incurred 
stock based compensation under sfas no 
r  the company uses a black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options 
the black scholes model includes various assumptions  including the expected life of stock options  the expected volatility and the expected risk free interest rate 
these assumptions reflect the company s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the company 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  total stock based compensation cost  as determined in accordance with sfas no 
r could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if the company uses different assumptions for future grants  stock based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods 
the company is required to record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures 
the company s forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data 
the actual forfeiture rate could differ from these estimates 
income taxes the company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  the company s tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
forward looking statements this form k and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company s actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the company s control 
such factors include  without limitation changes in the retailing environment and consumer preferences and spending habits  demographics and other macro economic factors that may impact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the company  general economic conditions  unusual weather patterns  competition from existing and potential competitors  competition from other channels of distribution  pricing pressures  the cost of labor  merchandise and other costs and expenses  the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the company s expansion program  and matters arising out of or related to the company s stock option grants and procedures and related matters  including the outcome or any other matters arising out of the informal inquiry commenced by the sec or the inquiry commenced by the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey  the possibility that the sec or the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey may not agree with all of the special committee s findings and recommendations and may require additional or different remediation or may bring proceedings in respect of such matters  any other proceedings which may be brought against the company by other governmental agencies  any tax implications relating to the company s stock option grants  the outcome of the shareholder derivative actions filed against certain of the company s officers and its directors and the possibility of other private litigation relating to such stock option grants and related matters
