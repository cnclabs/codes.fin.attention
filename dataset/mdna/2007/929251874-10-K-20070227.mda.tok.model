for the years ended december   and overview total assets at december   and were billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
this growth was driven by increases in the company s loan portfolio 
loans receivable net grew by million for the year ended december   when compared to the previous year  as a result of the company s continued strategy of growing its variable rate loan portfolio mainly through commercial real estate collateralized  construction and land acquisition  asset based and other industrial and agricultural commercial loans

the decrease in net income for the year ended december   when compared to year  was attributed to an increase of million in the provision for loan losses mainly attributed to the loan portfolio of the company s asset based lending division  an increase of million in noninterest expenses and an increase of million in the provision for income taxes 
such increases were partially offset by an increase of million in net interest income 
in  even though net interest income for the year ended december  increased by million and the provision for loan losses was million lower than that for the comparable prior year  net income was also impacted by the flat to inverted yield curve effect  a decrease of million in net gain on derivative instruments  an increase of million on noninterest expense and a significantly higher provision for income taxes of million 
in the year  the company recorded a charge of million million  net of taxes  mainly as a result of the change in the fair value during the year of certain interest rate swaps on a portion of the company s brokered deposits 
the company has maintained strong asset quality control  resulting in returns on average assets roa of  and and returns on average common stockholders equity roce of   and for the years ended  and  respectively 
results of operations net interest income the company s principal source of earnings is its net interest income 
this is the difference between interest income on loans and invested assets interest earning assets and its interest expense on deposits and borrowings  including federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements and advances from the fhlb interest bearing liabilities 
loan origination and commitments fees  net of related costs  are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loans as a yield adjustment 
gains or losses on the sale of loans and investments  service charges  fees and other income  also affect income 
in addition  the company s net income is affected by the level of its non interest expenses  such as the provision for loan losses  compensation  employees benefits  occupancy costs  other operating expenses and income taxes 
the main objective of the company s asset and liability management program is to invest funds judiciously and reduce interest rate risks while optimizing net income and maintaining adequate liquidity levels 
as further discussed in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  the company uses several tools to manage the risks associated with the composition and repricing of assets and liabilities 
therefore  management has followed a conservative practice inclined towards the preservation of capital with adequate returns 
the company s investment committee  which includes the entire board of directors and senior management  is responsible for the asset liability management oversight 
the investment department is responsible for implementing the policies established by the investment committee

the increase in the average investment portfolio was primarily in tax exempt securities  such as us government and agencies obligations as a result of the securities bought during the latter part of and the reinvestment of approximately million previously invested in short term money market instruments into short term tax exempt securities  specifically us government agencies discount notes 
notwithstanding  average yields earned in interest earning assets increased basis points  from in year  to for the year ended the increase in the average yield was mainly due to higher average yields earned on the loan portfolio  mortgage backed securities and money market instruments  while the remaining investment portfolio yield remained relatively flat increasing by only basis points to at december  the increase in the average yield earned on the loan portfolio was due to new higher yielding and the repricing of existing commercial and c i loans and residential real estate at floating rates

table of contents the provision for loan losses for the consumer loan portfolio  including the expresso of westernbank loan portfolio  increased by  or  from million for the year to million for the year the increase was primarily due to an increase in the delinquency levels of the consumer loan portfolio at december  the delinquency ratio on the consumer loan portfolio  including the expresso of westernbank loan portfolio  for the categories of days and over increased by basis points  to at december   when compared to for the comparable period last year 
the increase in the delinquency ratio of the consumer loans portfolio is mainly attributable to regular consumer loans past due over days which are collateralized by real estate properties 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans  and of total non performing loans reserve coverage  compared to an allowance for loan losses at december   of million or of total loans  and of total non performing loans 
the decrease in the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans ratio was principally due to the increase in non performing loans in commercial c i non performing loans  mainly from the company s asset based lending division 
for the year ended december   net loan charge offs amounted to million or to average loans  an increase of million or  when compared to million or to average loans in the increase in loans charged off for the year ended december   when compared to the same period in  is mainly attributed to an increase of million in commercial and c i loans charged off 
such increase in the commercial and c i loans charged off resulted principally from loans charged off on the company s asset based lending division 
during the year  the company partially charged off three loans of its asset based lending division with outstanding principal balances after charge offs of million  million and million  at december   as follows million on the million loan  million on the million loan and million on the million loan 
these loans are current and have not missed their payment schedules but have shortfalls in the collaterals and in the financial condition of the borrowers

the million loan did not require a valuation allowance at december  consumer loan charge offs for the year ended december   were million  an improvement of million or  when compared to million for the same period in such improvement is principally attributed to lower charge offs by the expresso of westernbank division  the principal component of the consumer loan charge offs 
loans charged off by the expresso of westernbank division decreased from million for the year ended december   to million for the same period in  a decrease of  this is the result of management s strategy of stabilizing loan losses and increasing the overall rates charged of the expresso loan portfolio by continuously reviewing its underwriting policies and increasing the level of collateralized loans 
the average yield of the expresso of westernbank loan portfolio was at december  also  the portion of the loan portfolio of expresso of westernbank collateralized by real estate at december   already accounts for of the outstanding balance 
the expresso loan portfolio includes small  unsecured consumer loans up to  and real estate collateralized consumer loans up to  these loans generally have a higher credit risk when compared to the rest of westernbank s consumer loan portfolio  since the expresso division principally targets the typical small consumer loan customers that are usually low income earners 
therefore  the expresso of westernbank division loan portfolio carries a higher risk of default when compared to the total consumer loans portfolio in general

table of contents portfolio of the expresso of westernbank and the decrease in net charge offs  principally in the expresso of westernbank division loan portfolio 
the decrease in the expresso of westernbank loan portfolio was mainly due to management s strategy of stabilizing charge offs as the division s portfolio matures and average yield continues to increase

the accounts written off are submitted to the collections department recovery unit for continued collection efforts 
recoveries made from accounts previously written off amounted to million in and million in the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of various conditions as the existing general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  terms  nature and volume of the portfolio  credit quality trends including trends in non performing loans expected to result from existing conditions  evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  collateral values  credit concentrations  trends in historical loss experience  specific impaired loans and delinquency trends  among other factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
although no assurance can be given  management believes that the present allowance for loan losses is adequate considering loss experience  delinquency trends and current economic conditions 
management regularly reviews the company s loan loss allowance as its loan portfolio grows and diversifies

the company evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other information and maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these relative risks and merits 
changes to the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due  among other  to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities and changes to statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative risks of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  can affect the income tax accruals as well as the current period s income tax expense and can be significant to the operating results of the company

deferred income taxes reflect the impact of credit  operating and capital losses carryforwards  and temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases 
the deferred income tax credit increased in and in changes in years and  are attributable to temporary differences in the recognition of certain items for tax and books  principally changes in the allowance for loan losses and in the unrealized loss on derivative instruments see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements

such increases were partially offset by an increase of million or in net interest income 
the decrease in net income for the year ended december   when compared to year  was impacted by an increase of million in net interest income as a result of higher yields on the average loan portfolio and in the average money market instruments portfolio  a provision for loan losses million lower than that for the comparable prior year  a decrease of million in the gain on derivative instruments  an increase of million in noninterest expense and a significantly higher provision for income taxes of million

residential real estate mortgage loans are mainly comprised of loans secured by first mortgages on one to four family residential properties 
at december   residential and commercial real estate loans included million in commercial loans  mainly secured by individual mortgages on one to four family residential properties  to two mortgage originator groups in puerto rico and million of mortgages insured or guaranteed by government agencies of the united states or puerto rico 
westernbank has a significant fixed rate lending concentration with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of million in one mortgage originator group in puerto rico at december  in addition  westernbank has outstanding million of fixed and floating rate loans to another mortgage originator group in puerto rico  for total outstanding loans to mortgage originator groups amounting to million at december  these commercial loans are secured by  individual mortgage loans on residential and commercial real estate with an average principal outstanding balance of  westernbank s historical experience with the mortgage originator groups is that they have paid these loans in accordance with their terms 
on march   westernbank obtained a waiver from the office of the commissioner of financial institutions of the commonwealth of puerto rico with respect to the statutory limit for individual borrowers loan to one borrower limit  which allows the company to retain the above significant commercial loans in its portfolio until these are paid in full 
on june   westernbank entered into an agreement to restructure the terms of the original transactions of the million lending relationship described above 
the agreement eliminated the recourse provisions on the underlying loans  terminated the counterparties call rights  converted the return from variable to a fixed rate  and resulted in a net compensation of million to westernbank 
one of the purposes of that transaction was to give westernbank the ability to use sale accounting treatment 
however  because most of the individual mortgage loans were originally transferred to the ultimate transferor within the mortgage originator group by two of its affiliates  the company has not been able to obtain persuasive evidence that the transfers of loans from the affiliates to the entity that subsequently transferred the loans to westernbank met all the criteria for sale accounting under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
as a result  the company continues to present these transactions as commercial loans secured by real estate mortgages 
the net compensation of million received by westernbank in connection with the june  transaction is being amortized over the remaining life of these loans as a yield adjustment 

table of contents westernbank originated billion of commercial real estate mortgage loans  including construction loans  during the year ended december  at december   commercial real estate mortgage loans totaled billion 
in general  commercial real estate mortgage loans are considered by management to be of somewhat greater risk of uncollectibility than residential lending because such loans are typically larger in size and more risk is concentrated in a single borrower 
in addition  the borrower s ability to repay a commercial loan or a construction loan depends  in the case of a commercial loan  on the successful operation of the business or the property securing the loan and  in the case of a construction loan  on the successful completion and sale or operation of the project

table of contents non performing loans and foreclosed real estate held for sale when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  westernbank attempts to cure the deficiency by contacting the borrower 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly 
if the delinquency exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures  westernbank will generally institute measures to remedy the default 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not cured  paid in full or refinanced  the property is sold at a judicial sale at which westernbank may acquire the property 
in the event that the property is sold at a price insufficient to cover the balance of the loan  the debtor remains liable for the deficiency 
thereafter  if westernbank acquires the property  such acquired property is appraised and included in the foreclosed real estate held for sale account at the fair value at the date of acquisition 
then  this asset is carried at the lower of fair value less estimated costs to sell or cost until the property is sold 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when there is a clear indication that the borrower s cash flows may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due  but in no event is it recognized after a borrower is days in arrears on payments of principal or interest 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all previously accrued and unpaid interest is charged against income and the loan is accounted for on the cash method thereafter  until qualifying for return to accrual status 
generally  a loan is returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal payments become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection and collectibility is no longer doubtful

the increase in non performing loans from year end  to year end mainly comes from the company s commercial real estate mortgage and commercial  industrial and agricultural loans c i portfolio

these loans are collateralized with real estate and did not require any valuation allowance 
at december   the allowance for possible loan losses was of total non performing loans reserve coverage 
allowance for loan losses westernbank maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on ongoing  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio  based on evaluations of the collectibility and historical loss experience of loans 
the company follows a systematic methodology to establish and evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this methodology consists of several key elements  which include the formula allowance 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans not otherwise covered by specific allowances 
loss factors are based on historical loss experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current condition on loss recognition 
factors that management considers in the analysis include the effect of the national and local economies  trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquencies  charge offs  non accrual and problem loans  asset quality trends  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices  and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the company s internal credit examiners 
loss factors are described as follows loan loss factors for commercial loans  including construction and land acquisition loans  are based on average loss trends historical net charge off and changes in the specific allowances for three to five years  as adjusted for management s expected increase in the loss factors given the significant increase in such loan portfolios over the last few years 
pooled loan loss factors are also based on average loss trends historical net charge off and changes in the specific allowances for one to three years 
pooled loans are loans that are homogeneous in nature  such as consumer installment  residential mortgage loans and credit cards 
specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments 
specific allowances are established and maintained where management has identified significant adverse conditions or circumstances related to a credit or portfolio segment that management believes indicate the probability that a loss has been incurred in excess of the amount determined by the application of the formula allowance 
larger commercial and construction loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
where appropriate  allowances are allocated to individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to westernbank 
in addition  the specific allowance incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans as provided in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended 
this accounting standard prescribes the measurement methods  income recognition and disclosures concerning impaired loans 
the unallocated allowance 
an unallocated allowance is established recognizing the estimation risk associated with the formula and specific allowances 
it is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions  the effects of which are not directly measured in determining the formula and specific allowances 
these conditions include then existing general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas  credit quality trends  including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  regulatory examination results  and findings of our internal credit examiners 
the evaluation of the inherent loss regarding these conditions involves a higher degree of uncertainty because these are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 

table of contents management assesses these conditions quarterly 
if any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of this condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to this credit or portfolio segment 
where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s evaluation of the probable loss concerning this condition is reflected in the unallocated allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is based upon estimates of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount actually observed for these losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
our methodology includes several features that are intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses 
historical loss factors for commercial and consumer loans may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current condition on loss recognition 
factors which management considers in the analysis include the effect of the national and local economies  trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquencies  charge offs  non accrual and problem loans  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices  and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the bank s internal credit examiners 
loan loss factors are adjusted quarterly based upon the level of net charge offs expected by management in the next twelve months  after taking into account historical loss ratios adjusted for current trends 
by assessing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loans portfolio on a quarterly basis  we are able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates based upon any more recent information that has become available 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  consisting of million formula allowance general allowance and million of specific allowance 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses equals of total loans  compared with an allowance for loan losses at december   of million  or of total loans 
as of december   there have been no significant changes in estimation methods or assumptions that affected our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses

for the year ended december   net loan charge offs amounted to million or of average loans  an increase of million or  when compared to million or to average loans in the increase in loans charged off for the year ended december   when compared to the same period in  is mainly attributed to an increase of million in commercial and c i loans charged off 
such increase in the commercial and c i loans charged off resulted principally from loans charged off on the company s asset based lending division 
during the year  the company partially charged off three loans of its asset based lending division with outstanding principal balances after charge offs of million  million and million  at december   as follows million on the million loan  million of the million loan and million on the million loan 
these loans are current and have not missed their payment schedules but have shortfalls in the collaterals and in the financial condition of the borrowers

the million loan did not require a valuation allowance at december  consumer loan charge offs for the year ended december   were million  an improvement of million or  when compared to million for the same period in such improvement is principally attributed to lower charge offs by the expresso of westernbank division  the principal component of the consumer loan charge offs 
loans charged off by the expresso of westernbank division decreased from million for the year ended december   to million for the same period in  a decrease of  this is the result of management s strategy of stabilizing loan losses and increasing the overall rates charged on the expresso loan portfolio by continuously reviewing its underwriting policies and increasing the level of collateralized loans

recoveries made from accounts previously written off amounted to million in and million in  an improvement of million or at december   the allowance for possible loan losses was of total non performing loans reserve coverage 
the decrease in the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans ratio was principally due to the increase in non performing loans in commercial c i non performing loans  mainly from the company s asset based lending division 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses from to was attributed to lower net charge offs of the expresso of westernbank division loan portfolio and relatively stable delinquencies in our commercial and consumer loan portfolios during the year  when compared to the same period in the provision for loan losses for westernbank business credit division accounted for million or of the total provision for loan losses for the year ended december   while for year  it accounted for million or of the total provision for loan losses 
the increase of million in the provision for loan losses for westernbank business credit division is mainly attributable to two factors  first  an increase in the division loss ratio as a result of a million partial charge off of one loan that was acquired in the original purchased loan portfolio of this division on june  the remaining outstanding principal balance of this loan at december   is million  with a specific valuation allowance of million 
second  the increase in the specific reserves of two loans of the division loan portfolio during the fourth quarter of year outstanding principal balances on these loans were million as explained above and million at december   with specific reserves of million and million  respectively 
the provision for loan losses for the consumer loan portfolio decreased by million  from to this decrease was primarily due to the relatively stable delinquency levels at the consumer loans portfolio  the decrease in the outstanding balance of the loan portfolio of the expresso of westernbank and the decrease in net charge offs  principally in the expresso of westernbank division loan portfolio 
the decrease in the expresso of westernbank loan portfolio was mainly due to management s strategy of stabilizing charge offs as the division s portfolio matures and average yield continues to increase 
for the year ended december   net charge offs to average loans decreased from for the year  to for the year in absolute dollar amounts  net charge offs remained relatively unchanged at million  when compared to million in commercial loans charged off were million for the year ended december   when compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or

recoveries made from accounts previously written off amounted to million in and million in the expresso loan portfolio includes small  unsecured consumer loans up to  and real estate collateralized consumer loans up to  these loans generally have a higher credit risk when compared to the rest of westernbank s consumer loan portfolio  since the expresso division principally targets the typical small consumer loan customers that are usually low income earners 
therefore  the expresso of westernbank division loan portfolio carries a higher risk of default when compared to the total consumer loans portfolio in general 
the expresso of westernbank division has established policies  procedures and controls to assess  monitor and adequately manage the specific credit risk posed by this loan portfolio under the fdic guidelines for sub prime lending programs  even though this program does not exceed the of capital applicable for such guidelines 
the division s loan analyses and applications are processed in the system software that has embedded controls to help enforce the lending policies and limits as approved by the division s senior management

loans are classified as impaired or not impaired in accordance with sfas no 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that westernbank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due  according to the contractual terms of the agreement 
westernbank measures the impairment of a loan based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or as a practical expedient  at the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
significant loans those exceeding  in   and  and  in are individually evaluated for impairment 
large groups of small balance  homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment  loans that are recorded at fair value or at the lower of cost or market are not evaluated for impairment 
the portfolios of mortgage and consumer loans are considered homogeneous and are evaluated collectively for impairment 
impaired loans for which the discounted cash flows  collateral value or market price exceeds its carrying value do not require an allowance

other deposits represented mainly by time deposits  brokered deposits and individual retirement account deposits ira s  increased from billion as of december   to billion as of december   an increase of billion or 
other deposits include brokered deposits amounting to billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
these accounts have historically been a stable source of funds 
in connection with its asset liability management  the company uses brokered deposits since these deposits provide the flexibility of selecting short  medium and long term maturities to better match its asset liability management strategies 
typically  brokered deposits tend to be highly rate sensitive deposits  and therefore  these are considered under many circumstances to be an unstable source of funding for an institution as compared to deposits generated primarily in a bank s local markets 
brokered deposits come primarily from brokers that provide intermediary services for banks and investors  therefore providing banks  such as westernbank  increased access to a broad range of potential depositors who have no relationship with westernbank and who actively seek the highest returns offered within the financial industry 
however  due to the competitive market for deposits in puerto rico  coupled with generally low interest rates in the united states  the rates paid by westernbank on these deposits are often lower than those paid for local market area retail deposits 
the puerto rico deposit market is more challenging than the deposit market on the us mainland 
puerto rico has a relatively stable population base  a number of very competitive local banks looking to expand  and a large proportion of citizens that do not have bank accounts 
also  the difference between the tax rate on interest earned from bank deposits  versus the much lower tax rate on returns from investments held in local mutual funds  preferred stock and local gnmas makes those other investments more attractive than deposits to some investors 
these dynamics present significant challenges for gathering and retaining local retail deposits 
the result is a high cost local deposits market 
the company believes that the benefits of brokered deposits outweigh the risk of deposits instability

liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the company s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet the funding needs of current loan demand  deposit withdrawals  principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and to pay operating expenses 
the company monitors its liquidity in accordance with guidelines established by the investment committee and applicable regulatory requirements 
the company s need for liquidity is affected by loan demand  net changes in deposit levels and the scheduled maturities of its borrowings 
liquidity demand caused by net reductions in deposits is usually caused by factors over which the company has limited control 
the company derives its liquidity from both its assets and liabilities 
liquidity is derived from assets by receipt of interest and principal payments and prepayments  by the ability to sell assets at market prices and by utilizing unpledged assets as collateral for borrowings 
at december   the company had approximately million in investment securities and other short term securities  such as money market instruments  maturing or repricing within one year or available for sale 
additional asset driven liquidity is provided by the remainder of the investment securities available for sale and securitized loans 
liquidity is derived from liabilities by maintaining a variety of funding sources  including deposits  advances and borrowings from the fhlb of new york and other short and long term borrowings  such as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 
other borrowings funding source limits are determined annually by each counterparty and depend on the company s financial condition and delivery of acceptable collateral securities 
the company may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities 
in addition  the company utilizes the broker deposits market as a source of cost effective deposit funding in addition to local market deposit inflows 
westernbank s ability to acquire brokered deposits can be restricted if in the future it becomes less than well capitalized 
an adequately capitalized bank  by regulation  may not accept deposits from brokers unless it applies for and receives a waiver from the fdic 
the company also uses the fhlb as a funding source  issuing notes payable  such as advances  and other borrowings  such as repurchase agreements  through its fhlb member subsidiary  westernbank 
this funding source requires westernbank to maintain a minimum amount of qualifying collateral with a fair value of at least and of the outstanding advances and repurchase agreements  respectively 
the company s liquidity targets are reviewed monthly by the investment committee and are based on the company s commitment to make loans and investments and its ability to generate funds 
the committee s targets are also affected by yields on available investments and upon the committee s judgment as to the attractiveness of such yields and its expectations as to future yields 
the company s investment portfolio at december   had an average contractual maturity of months 
the company s interest rate risk model takes into consideration the callable feature of certain investment securities 
assuming that all call features are exercised  the company s investment portfolio as of december   had a remaining average maturity of months

there were no borrowings outstanding as of december   under such lines of credit 
the agreements provide for unsecured advances to be used by the company on an overnight basis 
the interest rate is negotiated at the time of the transaction usually at fed funds rate 
the credit agreements are renewable annually

critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
in estimating the allowance for loan losses  management utilizes historical experience as well as other factors including the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values  the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers and increases or decreases in nonperforming and impaired loans 
changes in these factors may cause management s estimate of the allowance to increase or decrease and result in adjustments to the company s provision for loan losses 
see financial condition allowance for loan losses and note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents other than temporary impairments the company reviews its investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis or earlier if other factors indicative of potential impairment exist 
an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of income is recognized when the decline in the fair value of the securities below their cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
the company considers various factors in determining whether it should recognize an impairment charge  including  but not limited to the length of time and the extent the fair value of the security has been below its cost basis  the expectation for that security s performance  the credit worthiness of the issuer and the company s intent and ability to hold the security to maturity 
see financial condition investments and note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to other than temporary impairments 
financial instruments certain financial instruments including derivatives and investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income or noninterest income as appropriate 
fair values are based on listed market prices  if available 
if listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including price quotations for similar instruments 
fair value of certain derivative contracts are derived from an independent valuation model and periodically compared to quoted market prices 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the financial instruments 
certain liabilities and contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company s management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and therefore the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
such estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding past and expected gains or losses  current economic conditions  and risk characteristics  among other factors 
the following is a description of the most significant methods and assumptions used by the company in estimating the amounts reported in connection with certain liabilities and contingencies as disclosed in the financial statements income taxes the company is required to compute income taxes in connection with its preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
this computation involves estimates and assumptions made by the company s management based on its interpretation of current and enacted tax laws and regulations that affect the reported amounts of current and deferred income tax provisions 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax asset assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the tax benefit 
if expectations about future taxable income are not materialized  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance to reduce the recorded amount of its deferred tax asset resulting in an increase of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the company evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other information and maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these relative risks and merits 
changes to the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities and changes to statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative risks of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  can affect the income tax accruals as well as the current period s income tax expense and can be significant to the operating results of the company 
other contingencies the company is a defendant in legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
evaluation of these contingencies requires management of the company  after consultation with its legal counsel  to assume certain positions based on its interpretation of current laws and regulations 
such interpretations are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and  therefore  actual results could differ from management position and estimates

fin no 

this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by this

the sec staff indicates that registrants should quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on the current year financial statements 
this sab was effective for fiscal years ending after november  registrants may either restate their financials for any material misstatements arising from the application of this sab or recognize a cumulative effect of applying sab no

the adoption of this sab did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had no significant off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  included in part ii  item contractual obligations and commitments for information required in connection with the company s contractual obligations and commitments refer to section liquidity and capital resources of the management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  included in part ii  item market risk the company s financial performance is impacted by among other factors  interest rate risk and credit risk 
management considers interest rate risk the company s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of the company s net interest income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
the company does not utilize derivatives to mitigate its credit risk  relying instead on an extensive counterparty review process 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition allowance for loan losses 
interest rate risk is addressed by the company s asset liability committee alco  which includes the full board of directors and certain senior management representatives 
the alco monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact to the net portfolio of equity value and net interest income from potential changes to interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure 
the alco manages the company s balance sheet in part to minimize the potential impact on net portfolio value and net interest income despite changes in interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in net portfolio value in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
if potential changes to net portfolio value and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate changes are not within the limits established by the board  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within board approved limits 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company has implemented 
table of contents strategies to more closely match its balance sheet composition 
interest rate sensitivity is computed by estimating the changes in net portfolio of equity value  or market value over a range of potential changes in interest rates 
the market value of equity is the market value of the company s assets minus the market value of its liabilities plus or minus the market value of any off balance sheet items 
the market value of each asset  liability  and off balance sheet item is its net present value of expected cash flows discounted at market rates after adjustment for rate changes 
the company measures the impact on market value for an immediate and sustained basis points increase or decrease shock in interest rates 
the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
specific strategies have included securitization and sale of long term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans  shortening the average maturity of fixed rate loans and increasing the volume of variable and adjustable rate loans to reduce the average maturity of the company s interest earning assets 
all long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to federal home loan mortgage corporation  federal national mortgage association and government national mortgage association guidelines are sold for cash soon after origination 
in addition  the company enters into certain derivative financial instruments to hedge various exposures or to modify interest rate characteristics of various statements of financial condition items  such as interest rate swaps entered into to modify the interest rate characteristic of certain fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit 
this structured variable rate funding matches well with the company strategy of having a large floating rate commercial loan portfolio 
see note derivative instruments and hedging activities notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is exposed to changes in the level of net interest income nii in a changing interest rate environment 
nii will fluctuate pursuant to changes in the levels of interest rates and of interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
if the weighted average rates in effect at period end remain constant  or increase or decrease on an instantaneous and sustained change of plus or minus basis points  and all scheduled repricing  reinvestments and estimated prepayments  and reissuances are at such constant  or increase or decrease accordingly  nii will fluctuate as shown on the table below december  change in interest rate expected nii amount change change dollars in thousands basis points base scenario basis points december  change in interest rate expected nii amount change change dollars in thousands basis points base scenario basis points the nii figures exclude the effect of the amortization of loan fees 
the model utilized to create the information presented above makes various estimates at each level of interest rate change regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and or call activity on investment securities 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates which would result in significant differences in the calculated projected change 
in addition  the limits stated above do not necessarily represent the level of change under which management would undertake specific measures to realign its portfolio in order to reduce the projected level of change 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of 
table of contents interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
while the gap is a useful measurement and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on that measure 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
economic conditions  market area and competition puerto rico the island  a commonwealth of the united states of america the us  is the easternmost of the greater antilles and the fourth largest island of the caribbean 
the island is located at the crossroads between north and south america  at just hours airtime from new york and minutes from venezuela and has a population of approximately four million people 
in  the people of puerto rico became citizens of the us  and therefore puerto ricans serve in the united states armed forces 
as in the us  the island has a local judicial system 
the island constitutes a district in the federal judiciary and has its own us district court 
also  most of the us federal agencies are represented on the island 
however  the island has its own internal revenue system and is not subject to us taxes 
spanish and english are the official languages of the island 
the island uses us currency and forms part of the us financial system 
as a commonwealth of the us  the island falls within the us for purposes of customs and migration  and therefore there is a full exchange of funds  people and goods between the island and the us puerto rico banks are subject to the same federal laws  regulations and supervision as those of the financial institutions operating in the rest of us the federal deposit insurance corporation insures the deposits of puerto rico chartered commercial banks  including westernbank  the banking subsidiary of w holding company  inc the island economy operates as a region within the us  and therefore factors affecting the us economy usually have a significant impact on the performance of island economy 
these include exports  direct investment  the amount of federal transfer payments  the level of interest rates  the level of oil prices  the rate of inflation  and tourist expenditures 
in the past  the economy of the island has generally followed economic trends in the overall us economy 
however  in recent years economic growth in puerto rico has lagged behind growth in the us the economy of the island is mainly driven by the manufacturing and service sectors 
the manufacturing sector has experienced positive and negative changes over the past years as a result of increased emphasis on higher wage  high technology industries such as pharmaceuticals  biotechnology  electronics  computers  microprocessors  professional and scientific instruments  and certain high technology machinery and equipment  in addition to the reduction of tax incentives 
in recent years  the service sector also has played a major role in the economy  leading all sectors in providing employment 
in  the island economy continued its trend of decreasing growth  primarily due to weaker manufacturing  softer consumption and decreased government investment in construction 
considerable declines were recorded during year in the local manufacturing sector 
three important points for the manufacturing sector jobs  hours worked and payroll pointed toward the continued weakening of local manufacturing activity 
during  the manufacturing sector lost approximately  jobs in comparison with figures reported in  for a decrease of  although many multinational corporations continue to have substantial operations in the island 
as in year  the construction sector  a historical backbone of the island economy  remained relatively weak during year  as the combination of rising interest rates  the commonwealth s fiscal situation and decreasing public investment in construction projects affected the sector 
the value of construction permits during the year ended december  declined by approximately when compared to  with most of the drop coming from the public sector 
the multiplier effect of a decrease in capital investment has been already felt in other areas of the island economy  with the banking sector one of the most affected 
the banking sector has been historically the financial support for all the industrial and commercial activity on the island 
at december   there were approximately twelve banks operating in puerto rico  with total assets  loans and deposits of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively 
us banks  foreign banks and the major puerto rican banks all offer commercial banking services designed to support the emerging requirements of their local clients as well as of their international clients 
the economic strength and liquidity of local financial institutions  considered the pillar of the island s economy  have allowed the puerto rico banking sector to extend credit  without which the island s economy could not be sustained 
the growing combination of loans  deposits and assets has been the key to the economic progress for the past years 
loans  in particular  have played a key role in keeping the island economy afloat  through either personal  mortgage or commercial loans 

table of contents other economic indicators for year showed additional signals of weakness  as the island unemployment rate  which has been historically higher than the average us unemployment rate  stands at at december   since although the number of jobs was increasing  the workforce was growing at a faster tempo 
the rate of participation in the island workforce has been estimated in approximately 
the puerto rico gross domestic product remained unchanged in fiscal year the increase in the consumer price index in year was approximately 
tourism is the one sector that has been resilient 
activity in the sector has expanded consistently since  and in the year ended december  it registered the strongest increase in four years 
factors that may be boosting the tourism sector are geo political tensions throughout the world and a relative stable us economy 
the financial services and banking business are highly competitive  and the profitability of the company will depend principally upon the company s ability to continue to compete in its market area as well as to a significant extent upon general economic conditions in its market place 
the company competes with other commercial and non commercial banks  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking firms  asset based non bank lenders and certain other non financial institutions  including certain governmental organizations which may offer subsidized financing at lower rates than those offered by the company 
the company has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing technology and customer service  including local office decision making on loans  establishing long term customer relationships and building customer loyalty  and by providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of its customers 
significant deterioration in the local economy or external economic conditions  such as inflation  recession  unemployment  real estate values and other factors beyond the company s control  could also substantially impact the company s performance 
there can be no assurance that future adverse changes in the local economy would not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
current fiscal situation during and  the commonwealth of puerto rico considered several alternatives for a comprehensive tax and fiscal reform 
on july   the puerto rico legislature approved legislation amending the pr code to provide  among other things  for a general sales and use tax of  a municipal sales and use tax of and certain tax relief measures to be implemented as part of the tax reform 
although the tax and fiscal reforms have been adopted  there is no assurance that such measures will generate the projected revenues or savings 
it is impossible for the company to predict the impact that the current fiscal situation of the commonwealth will have on the island economy and thus on the company s results of operations 
rating downgrades on the government of puerto rico s debt obligations even though the island economy is closely integrated to that of the us mainland and its government and many of its instrumentalities are investment grade rated borrowers in the us capital markets  the current fiscal situation of the island has led nationally recognized rating agencies to downgrade its debt obligations 
in may  moody s investors service downgraded the government s general obligation bond rating to baa from baa  and put the credit on watch list for possible further downgrades 
the commonwealth s appropriation bonds and some of the subordinated revenue bonds were also downgraded by one notch and are now rated just below investment grade at ba moody s commented that this action reflects the government s strained financial condition  the ongoing political conflict and lack of agreement regarding the measures necessary to end the government s multi year trend of financial deterioration 
standard poor s rating services s p still rates the government s general obligations two notches above junk at bbb  and the commonwealth s appropriation bonds and some of the subordinated revenue bonds bbb  a category that continues to be investment grade rated 
in july  s p and moody s affirmed their credit ratings on the commonwealth debt  and removed the debt from their respective watch lists  thus reducing the possibility of an immediate additional downgrade 
these actions resulted after the government approved the budget for the fiscal year  which runs from july through june  which included the adoption of a new sales tax 
revenues from the sales tax will be dedicated primarily to fund the government s operating expenses  and to a lesser extent  to repay government debt and fund local municipal governments 
both rating agencies maintained the negative outlook for the puerto rico obligation bonds 
factors such as the government s ability to implement meaningful steps to curb operating expenditures  improve managerial and budgetary controls  and eliminate the government s reliance on operating budget loans from the government development bank for puerto rico will be key determinants of future rating stability and restoration of a stable long term outlook 
also  the inability to agree on future fiscal year commonwealth budgets could result in ratings pressure from the rating agencies 

table of contents it is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgrade in puerto rico s debt obligations 
however  the fallout from recent budgetary crisis and a possible ratings downgrade could adversely affect the value of puerto rico s government obligations 
during the quarter ended june   management concluded that certain held to maturity investments in puerto rico government obligations prgo s  with an amortized cost of  were other than temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment loss of million 
these securities were downgraded by one notch below investment grade in may as a result of the downgrade just below investment grade of these prgo s  they were transferred to the available for sale category at their fair value of
