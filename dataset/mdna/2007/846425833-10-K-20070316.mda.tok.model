table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the largest publicly traded hispanic controlled media and entertainment company in the united states 
we own and operate radio stations in markets that reach approximately of the us hispanic population  and two television stations  which reach approximately million households in the south florida market 
our radio stations are located in six of the top ten hispanic markets of los angeles  new york  puerto rico  chicago  miami and san francisco 
los angeles and new york have the largest and second largest hispanic populations  and are also the largest and second largest radio markets in the united states in terms of advertising revenue  respectively 
our two television stations operate as one television operation  branded mega tv 
as part of our operating business  we also operate lamusica 
com  mega 
tv  and our radio station websites which are bilingual spanish english websites providing content related to latin music  entertainment  news and culture 
we also occasionally produce live concerts and events throughout the united states and puerto rico 
on march   we acquired television stations wsbs tv channel  formerly known as wdlp tv and its derivative digital television station wsbs dt channel  formerly known as wdlp dt in key west  florida and wsbs ca channel  formerly known as wdlp ca in miami  florida  serving the south florida market 
on march   we also launched mega tv  our general interest spanish language television operation 
mega tv s programming is based on a strategy designed to showcase a combination of programs  ranging from televised radio branded shows to general entertainment programs  such as music  celebrity  debate  interviews and personality based shows 
as part of our strategy  we have incorporated certain of our on air personalities into our programming  as well as including interactive elements to compliment our internet websites 
we have developed approximately of our programming and have commissioned other content from capable spanish language production partners 
our television revenue is generated primarily from the sale of local advertising and paid programming 
the success of each of our stations depends significantly upon its audience ratings and share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
the broadcasting industry is a highly competitive business  but some barriers to entry do exist 
each of our stations competes with both spanish language and english language stations in its market  as well as with other advertising media  such as newspapers  cable television  the internet  magazines  outdoor advertising  satellite radio  transit advertising and direct mail marketing 
factors which are material to our competitive position include management experience  our stations rank in their markets  signal strength and frequency  and audience demographics  including the nature of the spanish language market targeted by a particular station 
our primary source of revenue is the sale of advertising time on our stations to local and national advertisers 
our revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates that our stations are able to charge  as well as the overall demand for advertising time in each respective market 
seasonal net broadcasting revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are primarily due to fluctuations in advertising demand from local and national advertisers 
typically for the broadcasting industry  the first calendar quarter generally produces the lowest revenue 
our most significant operating expenses are compensation expenses  programming expenses  professional fees and advertising and promotional expenses 
our senior management strives to control these expenses  as well as other expenses  by working closely with local station management and others  including vendors

we are in compliance with all covenants under our first lien credit facility and all other debt instruments as of december   and expect to be in compliance in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments  assumptions and estimates 
accounting for intangible assets our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of fcc broadcast licenses 
fcc licenses are granted to stations for up to eight years under the telecommunications act of the act 
the act requires the fcc to renew a broadcast license if i it finds that the station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  ii there have been no serious violations of either the communications act of or the fcc s rules and regulations by the licensee  and iii there have been no other serious violations  which taken together  constitute a pattern of abuse 
we intend to renew our licenses indefinitely and evidence supports our ability to do so 
historically  there has been no material challenge to our license renewals 
in addition  the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology any time in the foreseeable future 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we do not amortize our fcc licenses 
we test these indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an event occurs that may indicate that impairment 
table of contents may have occurred 
we utilize independent valuations to determine the fair value of the fcc licenses  as deemed necessary 
these valuations principally use the discounted cash flow methodology 
this income approach consists of a quantitative model  which assumes the fcc licenses are acquired and operated by a third party 
this income approach incorporates variables such as types of signals  media competition  audience share  market advertising revenue  market revenue projections  anticipated operating profit margins and various discount rates 
in the preparation of the fcc license appraisals  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the valuation of the intangible asset 
these estimates and assumptions could differ from actual results 
we generally test for impairment on our fcc license intangible assets at the individual license level 
however  we have applied the guidance in eitf  unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets eitf  to certain of our fcc license intangible assets 
eitf states that separately recorded indefinite lived intangible assets should be combined into a single unit of accounting for purposes of testing impairment if they are operated as a single asset and  as such  are essentially inseparable from one another 
we aggregate fcc licenses for impairment testing if their signals are simulcast and are operating as one revenue producing asset 
our goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations  when a business has been acquired under the applicable accounting literature 
sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level in lieu of being amortized 
we have determined that we have two reporting units under sfas no 
 radio and television 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit 
accordingly  the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended  and  we performed an annual impairment review of our indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that there was no impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
accounting for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax accounting 
these temporary differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 amortization of intangible assets and goodwill ceased for financial statement purposes 
as a result  we could not be assured that the reversals of the deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets and goodwill would occur within our net operating loss carry forward period 
therefore  on the date of adoption  we established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
we expect to continue to reserve for any increase in our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which accounts are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our history of write offs  relationships with our customers  age of the invoices and the overall creditworthiness of our customers 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred bad debt expense of million  million and million  respectively 
changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs 
revenue recognition we recognize broadcasting revenue as advertisements are aired on our stations  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  a fixed and determinable price  and reasonable assurance of collection 
agency commissions  where applicable  are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue 
advertisers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings  less their commission  to us when the advertisement is not placed directly by the advertiser 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as customer advances 
contingencies and litigations we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is the measurement of any tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
an enterprise that presents a classified statement of financial position should classify a liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the enterprise anticipates making a payment within one year or within the operating cycle 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  or fiscal year for us 
we are currently evaluating the impact that fin may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies when other accounting pronouncements require fair value measurements  it does not require new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  or fiscal year for us 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
may have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition 

table of contents market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in interest rates and other relevant market risks 
our primary market risk is a change in interest rates associated with borrowings under the first lien credit facility 
advances under the first lien credit facility bear base rate or eurodollar rate interest  plus applicable margins  which vary in accordance with prevailing economic conditions 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
at december   all of our debt  other than our first lien credit facility  had fixed interest rates 
as part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk  on june   we entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement that hedged fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on our current eurodollar rate of our million first lien credit facility at an interest rate for five years at  plus the applicable margin at december  
this agreement is intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
as a result  we believe that interest rate risk is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
as of december   the rates under our swap agreement were favorable compared to the market 
we will continue to evaluate swap rates as the market dictates 
they serve to stabilize our cash flow and expense but ultimately may cost more or less in interest than if we had carried all of our debt at a variable rate over the swap term 
if variable interest rates average higher in than they did during  our variable interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to a variable annualized estimated million for measured as of december  if interest rates average lower in than they did during  our interest income from cash and investment balances would decrease by approximately million  compared to million for these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate debt  cash equivalents and short term investment balances at december  our credit exposure under our interest rate swap agreement reflects the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party 
as a result  we selected a high credit quality financial institution as a counter party 
we do not anticipate non performance by such counter party  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counter party s non performance 
our credit exposure related to our accounts receivable does not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the broad range of markets in which we operate and a diverse group of advertisers
