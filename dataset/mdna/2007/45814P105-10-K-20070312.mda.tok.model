item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an explanation of forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our business we are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and the average duration of our earning assets 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although we believe we have implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates or continual flattening or inversion of the yield curve could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to lending risk 
there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate 
increases in interest rates  minimum required payments  energy prices and or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  the value of the collateral securing loans  or demand for our loan products 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial  agricultural  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate and consumer loans  which made up the remaining of our loan portfolio 
because the portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial  agricultural  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non performing loans 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
this risk materialized for us during the fourth quarter of  with the charge off of one lending relationship totaling million 
our allowance for possible loan losses may be insufficient 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
this reserve represents our best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in our judgment is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of various factors  including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  prior and current loss experience  the results of regulatory examinations  and current economic conditions 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for possible loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for possible loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers in southern indiana  southern and central illinois  western  central and northern kentucky and southwest ohio 
we have commercial real estate loan production offices located in cleveland  cincinnati  and columbus  ohio  as well as louisville  kentucky 
during the second and third quarters of  we hired an experienced commercial banking team in the cincinnati  ohio area 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets in which we operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
additionally  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
some of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
local or privately held community banking organizations in certain markets may price or structure their products in such a way that it makes it difficult for us to compete in those markets in a way that allows us to meet our profitability or credit goals 
any competitor may choose to offer pricing on loans and deposits that we think is irrational and choose to not compete with 
competitors may also be willing to extend credit without obtaining covenants or collateral and by offering weaker loan structures than we are willing to accept 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services  our reputation with consumers who reside in the markets we serve  the rate at which we introduce new products and services  customer satisfaction  and industry and general economic trends 
if we fail to perform in any of these areas  our competitive position and ability to grow would be weakened  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and face legal risks 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect several areas  including our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  and requirements to maintain the confidentially of information relating to our customers 
congress and federal agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation of statutes  regulations or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
additionally  the number of regulations we must comply with and the financial resources required to comply with those regulations has continually increased 
the costs of complying with these regulations makes it more difficult to remain competitive 
additionally  we are continually subject to various legal risks 
we may be perceived by some to have deep pockets and could be subject to various forms of actual or threatened litigation 
we utilize in house and external counsel to help us proactively manage those risks 

table of contents our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
we regularly review and update our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could result in fraud  operational or other losses that adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
fraud risks could include fraud by employees  vendors  customers or anyone we or our customers do business or come in contact with 
the parent company relies on dividends from integra bank for most of its revenue 
our parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from integra bank 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt 
federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to the parent company 
also  a holding company s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event integra bank is unable to pay dividends to the parent company  the parent company may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on its common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from integra bank could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 
we seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar  have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale or expanded services 
acquiring other banks  businesses  or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of our management s time and attention  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company  and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company 
we evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction 
furthermore  if we fail to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from an acquisition  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our local markets  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 

table of contents our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems  including risks to data integrity 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations

the ability of integra bank to pay such dividends is governed by banking laws and regulations 
additional discussion regarding dividends is included in the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements  and other market conditions 
we do not intend to publicly announce any suspension of the program 
there have been no purchases made under this program through december  we did not sell any equity securities which were not registered under the securities act of during the fourth quarter of the information required by this item concerning equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference in item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters to this report

overview was the third year of a three year strategic plan we announced in to build shareholder value by improving our performance relative to a peer group of other publicly held midwest banking companies of similar size 
the plan consisted of four key elements accelerate revenue growth  improve operating efficiency  provide quality service  develop employees and continue to increase our managerial depth  and lower our risk profile by reducing non performing loans 
in  we met or exceeded the goals in the areas of accelerating revenue growth  improving operating efficiency  providing quality service  developing existing employees and increasing our managerial depth 
our ratio of non performing to total loans at december  was  the lowest in several years 
however  in the fourth quarter we charged off a  lending relationship  as a result of suspected fraud by the borrower  significantly affecting our earnings for this charge off is further discussed below and in the credit management section of this document 
new customers continued to be the primary driver of increased revenue in several key areas 
our asset mix continued to improve  with higher yielding commercial loans growing  or from and making up about of average total earning assets  compared to in and in positive loan growth continued in commercial banking  led primarily by commercial real estate 
the growth in commercial real estate continued to exceed expectations and was accompanied by excellent credit results  helping us maintain a stable net interest margin  despite the inversion of the yield curve for most of the continuing success of our high performance checking initiative first rolled out in has exceeded our expectations  as even more new accounts were opened in and the level of activity in those accounts increased 
net income for the year was  a decrease of  or from the decrease was directly a result of the fourth quarter charge off and related provision 
additional results for were as follows diluted earnings per share for were compared to in  return on assets decreased to from  return on equity decreased to from  efficiency ratio was compared to  net interest margin was  a decrease of basis point  
table of contents the provision for loan losses was  and included the  charge off  the number of checking accounts grew by in  service charge income grew by in after growing in debit card fee income and trust fees increased by and  and non interest expense declined by  or 
we continued to be disciplined in our management of capital in the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets increased basis points to 
the provision for loan losses was negatively impacted by the fourth quarter charge off of the  lending relationship  raising our provision for loan losses to  this lending relationship was made up of four loans to a charter airline and its majority owner and was secured by what we understood to be the majority owner s preferred stock in the charter airline 
more details related to this charge off are included in the below credit management section of this form k  as well as in our december  audited financial statements  which are included in this report 
total net charge offs for were  in october  we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire prairie financial corporation of bridgeview  illinois prairie 
prairie is a privately held  year old community bank with five offices in the chicago metropolitan statistical area 
under the terms of the merger agreement  which has been unanimously approved by our and prairie s boards of directors  each share of prairie stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of integra stock and in cash 
based on our closing stock price on october  of per share  the merger consideration is equivalent to per share of prairie common stock or  in total 
the combined company expects to achieve total annual cost savings of approximately  pre tax  of which is expected to be achieved in the merger is expected to be cents accretive to our earnings per share in  excluding merger related expenses of cents and then cents accretive to earnings per share in we look forward to the opportunities this merger will provide to us 
additionally  during the second quarter of  we added an experienced commercial banking team in the cincinnati  ohio area that  during the third and fourth quarters  showed solid growth in terms of new loans and deposits 
our top priority in was to achieve peer median performance in the key areas described above 
we believe we achieved our goals in these areas  with the exception of the impact to net charge offs and provision caused by the fourth quarter charge off 
we executed a future expansion into the high growth chicago  illinois  market  as well as increasing our presence and product offerings in the cincinnati  ohio  area and continued our strong commercial loan growth and high performance checking initiatives  all while lowering expenses 
we continued our focus to provide excellent customer service and convenience 
we believe we have a talented employee base and have seen benefits from our initiatives to improve management depth and succession 
our management team has developed and our board of directors has approved a new three year plan that will end in our goal is to achieve earnings growth and total shareholder return in the first quartile of our midwest peer group 
the key components of our plan are to continue to acquire new customers and do more with them as we continue our growth initiatives  improve our net interest income spread income by increasing loan yields by replacing residential mortgage and indirect marine and recreational vehicle loans with commercial loans and by growing total loans and lower cost deposits  increase our presence in faster growing metro markets by executing selective acquisitions like prairie and by continuing to recruit successful and experienced lending and product teams  improve operating leverage grow revenue faster than expenses by reducing expenses in lower growth and profitability lines of business and by investing in higher growth and higher return lines of business  and allocate capital to increase total shareholder returns by achieving organic growth  executing acquisitions and providing returns to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks 

table of contents critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider our critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for losses  and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances  and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the section labeled credit management below provides additional information on this subject 
we consider loans impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
in measuring the market value of the collateral  we use assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience and the conditions of the various markets in which the collateral may be liquidated may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimation of market value the estimation of market value is significant to several of our assets  including loans held for sale  investment securities available for sale  mortgage servicing rights  other real estate owned  as well as market values associated with derivative financial instruments and goodwill and other intangibles 
these are all recorded at either market value or the lower of cost or market value 
market values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the market value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
market values may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
market values for securities available for sale are based on quoted market prices 
if a quoted market price is not available  market values are estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities 
the market values for loans held for sale are based upon quoted market values while the market values of mortgage servicing rights are based on discounted cash flow analysis utilizing dealer consensus prepayment speeds and market discount rates 
the market values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
the market values of derivative financial instruments are estimated based on current market quotes 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we assess goodwill for impairment no less than annually by applying a fair value based test using net present value of estimated net cash flows 
impairment exists when the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with an asset or liability 
core deposit intangibles are recorded at fair value  based on a discounted cash model valuation at the time of acquisition and are evaluated periodically for impairment 

table of contents mortgage servicing rights  or msrs  represent an estimate of the present value of future cash servicing income  net of estimated costs  we expect to receive on loans sold with servicing retained 
msrs are capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained 
the carrying value of msrs is amortized in proportion to and over the period of net servicing income and this amortization is recorded as a reduction to income 
the carrying value of msrs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on fair value 
we disaggregate our servicing rights portfolio based on loan type and interest rate  which are the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
any impairment would need to be reported as a valuation allowance 
a primary factor influencing the fair value is the estimated life of the underlying loans serviced 
the estimated life of the loans serviced is significantly influenced by market interest rates 
during a period of declining interest rates  the fair value of the msrs should decline due to an expected increase in prepayments within the portfolio 
alternatively  during a period of rising interest rates the fair value of msrs should increase as prepayments on the underlying loans would be expected to decline 
on an ongoing basis  management considers relevant factors to estimate the fair value of the msrs to be recorded when the loans are initially sold with servicing retained 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income as reported in the financial statements 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
tax credits are recorded as a reduction to tax provision in the period for which the credits may be utilized

table of contents net interest income net interest income in the following tables is on a tax equivalent basis and is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest expense paid on liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates  changes in interest rates  and by changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest income for the last two years are presented in the schedule following the three year average balance sheet analysis

tax exempt income  such as interest on loans and securities of state and political subdivisions  has been increased to an amount that would have been earned had such income been taxable 
net interest income for was  or lower than the decrease was primarily due to the effects of a flattening yield curve during that became inverted during and increased funding costs quicker than the increase in asset yields  offset by an improved earning asset mix  particularly within total loans 
the inversion of the yield curve had a negative effect on us because more of our liabilities matured or repriced in the short term than did some of the assets those liabilities were funding 
major contributors to the change in net interest income from to are as follows average earning assets decreased  or  driven by decreases in average securities balances of  and residential mortgage loans of  these decreases were largely offset by increases in average commercial loan balances of  and direct consumer loans of  this change in the composition of earning assets was in line with our strategy of improving our mix of earning assets by reducing lower yielding securities  residential mortgage loan and indirect consumer loan balances and offsetting those declines with increases in higher yielding commercial loans 
the increase in average commercial loan balances for was driven by increases in commercial real estate loans of  and also from the commercial lending team added during the second and third quarters in the cincinnati  ohio area 
this group ended the year with outstanding balances of  the average rate of commercial loans increased basis points  as loans repriced throughout to higher rates brought about by market rate increases and new originations were priced at higher rates than during 
table of contents non interest bearing deposit average balances increased  while the average balances of savings and interest bearing demand deposits  which have an average cost of basis points  declined  these core deposits were largely offset by increases in the average balances of money market accounts  which had an average cost of  of  the shift from low and very low cost deposits to higher yielding money market accounts occurred throughout the first three quarters of for us and throughout the banking industry  as consumers opted for higher rate investment alternatives and deposit products 
during the fourth quarter  this migration abated 
a shift in funding sources occurred in the average balance of brokered certificates of deposit increased  while long term borrowing average balances declined  helping result in an lower overall balance of interest bearing liabilities of  this shift took place during in part due to the maturity and refinancing of  of fixed term debt that carried a weighted average rate of and matured in march  this shift in funding removed bullet risk by layering maturities over a one to three year period 
it also helped us improve our overall liquidity position and demonstrated a lower level of reliance on fhlb funding 
fourth quarter net interest income was negatively impacted by the reversal of accrued interest of from the  loan that was charged off during the quarter 
the impact to the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was approximately basis points 
daily overdraft fees increased or as a result of a higher number of accounts and a higher level of activity within those accounts 
net interest income for was  or lower than the decrease was primarily due to the effects of a flattening yield curve during which resulted in increased funding costs that exceeded the increase in asset yields  and a reduction in the securities portfolio that was offset by an increase in loans  partially offset by a net reduction of borrowings 
the flattening of the yield curve negatively impacted us as more liabilities matured or repriced in the short term than did some of the assets those liabilities were funding 
major contributors to the change in net interest income from to are as follows average earning assets decreased  or  driven by decreases in average securities balances of  partially offset by increases in average loan balances of  this change was in line with our strategy of reducing the size of our securities portfolio and improving the mix of our earning assets 
the increase in average loan balances was driven by increases in commercial loans of  the majority of which came in the area of commercial real estate  increases in consumer loans of  and declines in residential mortgages of  the reduction in the securities portfolio also reduced the wholesale borrowings funding that portfolio 
a change in the timing of assessing daily overdraft fees on overdraft loans reduced these fees by this change was by design and was a component of our high performance checking initiative 
this initiative included the simplification of our transaction accounts  and changes in several of the fees associated with those accounts  including the daily overdraft fee 
during the second quarter of  we sold three branches that included  in loans and  in deposits  including  in valuable core deposits 
average loan yields increased  contributing  of additional income over higher deposit rates increased interest expense by  while the average cost of borrowings increased adding  in interest expense 
the majority of the securities portfolio was comprised of fixed rate instruments  while wholesale funding included a considerable volume of short term public certificates of deposit  repurchase agreements and other floating rate debt 
as rates increased  the spread between the investments and the liabilities funding them decreased 
while this spread declined during  it remained positive 

table of contents during the second quarter of  a write down of of premiums for acquired loans was recorded in connection with an evaluation of the remaining period of amortization 
prepayments of the related loans were occurring more frequently than originally estimated 
non interest income non interest income for was  or lower than results for included increases in deposit service charges of  debit card interchange revenue of  and trust revenue of additionally  also included securities gains of  while included losses on sales of securities of  results for also included gains from the sale of three branches of  as well as a gain from the sale of our merchant credit card portfolio of major contributors to the change in non interest income from to are as follows the increase in deposit service charges is a result of the success of our high performance checking initiative 
this program resulted in a net increase of approximately  checking accounts since the beginning of  and  coupled with higher levels of customer activity  resulted in the higher level of fee income 
the increase in number of accounts  coupled with a higher usage of debit cards as a method of payment by our customers  resulted in higher interchange fees 
the increase in trust revenue was a result of an increase in assets managed by our trust department at december  of from december  this occurred as a result of both a greater number of customers and assets managed  as well as an increase in the market value of equity securities within customer accounts  which increased as the market improved throughout securities gains of occurred during the fourth quarter of  as issuers of bonds exercised call options to redeem them at premiums ranging from to of their current outstanding balance 
life insurance income declined or from this was primarily the result of bank owned life insurance death benefits that we received in of  as compared to in non interest income for was  or higher than the increase was primarily due to a gain on sale of three branches of  a gain on the sale of our merchant credit card portfolio of  increases in service charges on deposits of  debit card interchange income of and death benefits from life insurance claims of these items were partially offset by a reduction in credit card fee income of  a reduction in securities gains of  and a reduction in mortgage banking and gain on sale of mortgage loans of a combined the level of deposit account fee income is highly dependent on both the number of accounts and the level of activity on those accounts 
lending fees are highly dependent on the number of loans originated 
major contributors to the change in non interest income from to are as follows we sold three branches in southern illinois during the second quarter of for a gain of  the sale included  in loans and  in deposits 
we rolled out our high performance checking products in  which included the redesign of transaction accounts  a reduction of several of the fees associated with those accounts  and a sales and marketing approach designed to emphasize new account openings 
as a result of this initiative  we almost doubled the number of new checking account openings in as compared to  and increased overall product usage 
this resulted in an increase in service charges of  or 
the increased number of accounts and greater debit card usage also contributed to an increase in debit card interchange income 
we received death benefits from two bank owned life insurance policies in the first of these  totaling  was received during the third quarter with the second  totaling  being received in the fourth quarter 
during the first quarter of  we sold our merchant credit card portfolio for a gain of the sale of this portfolio  and elimination of related expense  has been and continues to be expected to improve net income 
we continue to receive fee income for the merchant portfolio 

table of contents the securities gains we recognized in resulted largely from the first quarter balance sheet restructuring and offset a portion of the costs associated with the restructuring 
in  securities losses of  included an other than temporary impairment charge of on  of agency perpetual preferred securities that do not have a maturity date or contractual cash flows that come back to us 
these securities are not actively traded  resulting in impairment 
additionally  two agency backed collateralized mortgage obligations with a book value of  were determined to be other than temporarily impaired  when we decided to sell them  resulting in a first quarter loss of these securities were sold during the second quarter and an additional loss of was incurred 
credit card fees in declined due to the sale of that portfolio in fees for include fees received from revenue sharing agreements with the purchaser of the portfolio 
we also benefit from a reduced loan loss provision and reduced processing expenses 
the decline in mortgage banking revenue and gains on sale of mortgage loans in resulted from a continued increase in interest rates  resulting in lower demand  including less refinance activity 
the flattening of the yield curve narrowed the rate differential between fixed and adjustable rate products  contributing to a reduction in adjustable rate mortgage originations which we typically retain on our balance sheet 
non interest expense non interest expense for was  compared to  in  a decrease of 
non interest expense for included reductions in professional fees of  salaries expense of  incentives of  processing expense of  and franchise  sales  state and local taxes of partially offsetting these items were increases in medical expense of  postretirement health insurance of  stock option expense of  occupancy expense of and low income housing partnership losses of major contributors to the net reduction of non interest expense from to are as follows professional fees declined largely as a result of our changing audit firms for total audit fees were reduced by or from legal fees declined or largely due to expenses related to the ongoing audit of our tax returns  by having our in house counsel we hired in deal with issues we previously outsourced  and a reduced level of litigation 
other professional fees declined due to lower expenses in the area of branch mystery shopping and facilities design 
the reduction in salaries expense was a result of a further reduction to our workforce  from average ftes during to average ftes in continued ongoing initiatives to find and execute efficiencies were successful  allowing us to reallocate resources to higher yielding businesses  such as the commercial lending team added during the second and third quarters of at december   we had full time equivalent employees compared to in and in incentives declined from largely due to a reduction in executive incentive compensation expense that resulted because of the fourth quarter loan charge off 
processing expense declined from largely due to successful execution of expense reduction initiatives that resulted in new contracts and lower costs  particularly in the area of atm and debit card transaction processing 
franchise  sales  state and local tax expense declined because of the filing of a franchise tax refund claim for a prior year  a sales tax liability paid in that did not reoccur in and resulted from a audit  and lower franchise tax liabilities  as well as lower state and local deposit taxes 
the increase in medical expense was primarily the result of two items 
first  we began to offer and pay for health insurance benefits to part time employees in second  in  we had a higher level of individually significant claims that approached or exceeded the stop loss amounts included in our self insured health plan 
we continue to focus on several initiatives in the area of preventive care in an effort to have a healthier workforce and lower overall health insurance costs 

table of contents during  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which resulted in the recognition of of stock option expense for options issued during prior to  this expense was not recognized in the statement of income  but rather recognized on a pro forma basis in the footnotes to the financial statements 
total expense recognized for all stock based compensation for employees and directors  including restricted stock  was in compared to in the increase in occupancy expense was caused by the lease of additional space in an existing facility during the fourth quarter of the year  a switch in facilities management companies and related transition expenses  higher real property taxes and higher utilities expense 
the increase in low income housing partnership investment expenses was due to higher than expected operating losses from the partnerships we have investments in 
the returns we receive on these investments consist of the tax benefits we receive from the tax deductible losses the partnerships generate  plus low income housing tax credits we receive  less the actual losses 
non interest expense for was  as compared to  in the decrease was primarily due to  of debt prepayment fees incurred during  decreases in several categories including  in salaries and employee benefits  in processing  in amortization of intangible assets  and in other expenses 
these items were partially offset by increases in occupancy expense of and communication and transportation of  major contributors to the net reduction of non interest expense from to are as follows the balance sheet restructuring resulted in debt prepayment penalties of  there were no such costs incurred in the salaries and employee benefits reduction was primarily due to three items 
first  we reduced our workforce from average ftes during to average ftes in a continued emphasis on finding and executing efficiencies  along with changes in our business  such as the sale of the three illinois banking centers and the sale of the merchant credit card portfolio were largely responsible for these reductions 
at december   we had full time equivalent employees compared to in second  medical costs under our self insured health plan were lower than anticipated 
average claims were positively impacted by a focus on preventive care  as well as a relatively low level of individually significant claims that reached our stop loss insurance policy minimums 
third  we implemented a new retail incentive plan that more closely matched incentive pay with performance 
the increase in occupancy expense is due primarily to new banking centers opened in late and early  partially offset by a reduction resulting from the second quarter branch sale 
banking centers opened in late and early include evansville  indiana july  henderson  kentucky december  and florence  kentucky may 
communication and transportation expenses include an increase in postage of  as compared to the postage increase is largely the result of a higher number of mailings to promote deposit products and the high performance checking initiative 
the decline in processing costs is largely attributable to sale of the merchant credit card portfolio during the first quarter of and the elimination of related processing costs of  the decline in amortization of intangible assets occurred because the amortization period for a portion of our core deposit intangibles ended in december this resulted in elimination of amortization expense of in  as compared to goodwill and certain other intangible assets are regularly tested for impairment 
we completed this testing in and found no impairment 
the decline in other expense was in large part due to a third quarter write down of a property held in other real estate owned 

table of contents income taxes we recognized income tax expense of  in  as compared to  in  and a benefit of  in the effective tax rate for was and includes the benefits of  of low income tax housing credits 
these credits are a direct offset to tax expense and a large component of lowering tax expense in each of the three years presented 
this compares to an effective tax rate of and total tax credits of  in the tax rate declined from because of a lower level of pre tax income  which is attributed largely to the  fourth quarter loan charge off and its effect on the provision for loan losses and taxable income 
the benefit resulted from the loss incurred as a result of the balance sheet restructuring completed that year 
we expect to be able to utilize all available carried forward net operating losses and tax credits in future periods

this has resulted in an improved interest rate risk profile  a stable net interest margin and an improved mix of earning assets 
mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  represented of the securities portfolio at december   as compared to at december  mortgage backed securities carry an inherent prepayment risk  which occurs when borrowers prepay their obligations due to market fluctuations and rates 
prepayment rates generally can be expected to increase during periods of lower interest rates as underlying mortgages are refinanced at lower rates 
our present investment strategy focuses on shorter duration securities with more predictable cash flows in a variety of interest rate scenarios

loans loans  net of unearned income  at december   totaled  compared to  at year end  reflecting an increase of  or 
commercial loans  which include commercial  industrial and agricultural  commercial real estate  and construction and development  increased  at december   compared to year end this increase was driven primarily by an increase in commercial construction and development loans originated by our commercial real estate line of business 
this line of business was initiated in the second half of when we opened loan production offices  or lpos  in metro cincinnati and cleveland  ohio  and louisville  kentucky 
we opened a fourth lpo in columbus  ohio in in  the commercial real estate lending group originated approximately  in new loans  compared to  in and  in outstanding balances for loans managed by this group totaled  at december  compared to 
table of contents  at december  the majority of these loans were made within the areas the lpos serve 
these loans were used to finance a variety of construction and development projects that included apartments  residential land developments  condominiums  retail centers  office buildings  as well as some hospitality and industrial type properties 
loans are occasionally made on projects outside the markets served by the lpos to borrowers who are either located within our market area or who have previous lending relationships with our commercial real estate lenders 
competition for these credits typically comes from larger national and regional commercial banks 
since the inception of this line of business  this portfolio has not experienced any charge offs  while generating returns in excess of those originally forecasted when the strategy was launched 
commercial  industrial and agricultural loans decreased  or from year end the net decrease was due to a decline in outstanding balances originated in our community markets and a fourth quarter  charge off  offset by the outstanding balance of loans originated by the commercial lending team which began operations in the cincinnati  ohio metro area during the second and third quarters of total commercial and industrial loans for this group totaled  at december  residential mortgage loans decreased  or from year end  while total originations increased slightly 
the current interest rate environment resulted in customer preferences toward fixed rate loan products  which we typically sell to the secondary market after they are originated  as well as a lower level of refinance activity 
in  approximately  or of new originations were through direct retail channels  while approximately  or were originated on a wholesale basis 
this compares to  or and  or in the inversion of the yield curve resulted in increased customer demand for fixed rate products 
this led to a decline in new originations that are retained and recorded on our balance sheet 
the decline was also a component of our efforts to improve our mix of earning assets 
the level of higher yielding commercial loans increased  while residential mortgage  indirect consumer and securities balances decreased 
in early  we made the decision to private label our residential mortgage processing  underwriting  closing and servicing 
under this business model  the number of loans we originate and retain on our balance sheet will continue to decline  as will the outstanding balances of this portfolio 
home equity loans decreased  or at december   as the rising interest rate environment continued to negatively impact the origination of variable rate products  causing many borrowers to refinance into fixed rate home equity loans or mortgages 
home equity loans are generally collateralized by a second mortgage on the customer s primary residence 
consumer loans decreased  or at december   primarily due to a decrease in indirect dealer originations of  from consumer loans include both direct and indirect loans 
the indirect loans are to borrowers located primarily in the midwest and are generally secured by recreational vehicle or marine assets 
indirect loans at december   were  compared to  at december  indirect loan balances declined in part due to a decision to limit origination of lower yielding indirect marine and recreational vehicle loans during  while using those funds  along with funds generated from paydowns from lower yielding residential mortgage and securities balances  to generate higher yielding commercial loans 
we stopped originating indirect marine and recreational vehicle loans in december

we concentrate substantially all of our lending activity by lending to customers located in the geographic market areas that we serve  primarily indiana  illinois  kentucky and ohio 
the loan portfolio is also diversified by type of loan and industry 
we lend to customers in various industries including real estate  agricultural  health and other related services  and manufacturing 
there is no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of the portfolio nor does the portfolio contain any loans to finance speculative transactions or loans to foreign entities

nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest recognition has been suspended because of doubts as to the borrower s ability to repay principal or interest according to the terms of the contract 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status after becoming days past due if the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question or when we determine the loan is impaired 
loans which are current  but as to which serious doubt exists about repayment ability  may also be placed on nonaccrual status 
restructured loans are loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest because of the borrower s financial position 
loans days or more past due  which totaled at december   are loans that are continuing to accrue interest  but which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
other real estate owned represents properties obtained for debts previously contracted 
we are not aware of any loans which have not been disclosed as non performing assets that represent or result from unfavorable trends or uncertainties which we reasonably believe will materially adversely affect future operating results  liquidity or capital resources  or represent material credits as to which we have serious doubt as to the ability of such borrower to comply with loan repayment terms

non performing loans were and of loans  net of unearned income at the end of and  respectively 
we actively manage non performing loans in order to minimize this level 
the change in the components of non performing assets was due primarily to the second quarter payoff of a loan that was classified as non performing during the second quarter of we had a participation in this loan  which  at the time it was classified to non performing  had an outstanding balance of  during the second quarter of  this loan  which then carried a balance of  was paid off

the amount of interest that would have been earned had these nonaccrual loans remained in accruing status was  and  for  and  respectively 
we maintain a watch list of commercial loans and review those loans quarterly 
for the most part  assets are designated as watch list loans to ensure more frequent monitoring 
the assets are reviewed to ensure proper earning status and management strategy 
if it is determined that there is serious doubt as to performance in accordance with the original terms of the contract then the loan is placed on nonaccrual 
we also review non accrual loans on an ongoing basis 
credit management our credit management procedures include board oversight of the lending function by the board s credit and risk management committee  which meets at least quarterly 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  non performing loans and assets  problem and watch list loans and charge offs 
the lending policies address risks associated with each type of lending  including collateralization  loan to value ratios  loan concentrations  insider lending and other pertinent matters and are regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate for the current lending environment 
in addition  a sample of loans is reviewed by an independent loan review department or outside independent third party  as well as by a compliance department and regulatory agencies 
consumer  mortgage and small business loans are centrally underwritten and approved while commercial loans are approved through a combination of low individual lending authorities  independent senior credit officers and a corporate credit committee 
a limited number of officers have the authority  in certain cases and for certain loan types  to override centrally denied loan requests 
those overrides are subject to certain stipulations and are centrally tracked and monitored for performance 
the corporate credit committee approves or ratifies all loans of  or more 
the allowance for loan losses is that amount which  in management s opinion  is adequate to absorb probable inherent loan losses as determined by our ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is based upon consideration of various factors including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  industry concentrations  prior and current loss experience  the results of recent regulatory examinations and economic conditions 
loans that are deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance  while recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance 
the provision for loan losses is the amount charged to operations to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb probable losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable losses inherent in the credit portfolios 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance establishes both an allocated and unallocated component 
the allocated component of the allowance for commercial loans is based on a review of specific loans as well as delinquency  classification levels and historic charge offs for pools of non reviewed loans 
for consumer loans  the allocated component is based on loan payment status and historical loss rates 
a periodic review of selected loans based on risk rating and size is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with the relationship manager 
table of contents responsible for the credit relationship 
this review is supplemented by the loan review area  which provides information assisting in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and in deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk which should be recognized 
where appropriate  an allocation is made to the allowance for individual loans based on our estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to us 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
we consider loans impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the allowance established for impaired loans is generally based  for all collateral dependent loans  on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
for non collateral dependent loans  the allowance is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement 
homogeneous pools of loans  such as consumer installment and residential real estate loans  are not individually reviewed 
an allowance is established for each pool of loans based upon historical loss ratios  based on the net charge off history by loan category 
in addition  the allowance reflects other risks affecting the loan portfolio  such as economic conditions in our geographic areas  specific industry financial conditions and other factors 
the unallocated portion of the allowance covers general economic uncertainties as well as the imprecision inherent in any loan and lease loss forecasting methodology 
at december   the unallocated reserve included within the allowance for loan losses was  as compared to at december  the factors used to evaluate homogenous loans in accordance with the sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly and are updated as conditions warrant 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by our periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon consideration of actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis and presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval 
the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses are significant policies that involve the use of estimates and a high degree of subjectivity 
we have developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect the assessment of credit risk after careful consideration of known relevant facts 
in developing this assessment  we must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries or issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield different results  which may require an increase or decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
our process to perform this analysis includes expanded data analysis  back testing and continued refinements to documentation surrounding the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance provides reliable measures of the probability of default and risk of loss for our categories of loans with similar risk characteristics and analyzes loss data over a period of time that we believe is appropriate and which is periodically reevaluated 
this improves the measure of inherent loss over a complete economic cycle and reduces the impact for qualitative adjustments 
this process does not impact losses estimated in accordance with financial accounting standard  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
we continue to enhance our loan portfolio monitoring system to enhance our risk management capabilities 
in  we implemented the markov migration model for our commercial portfolio 
among the most significant enhancements were expanded score band performance  loan to value analysis  and vintage analysis 
initiatives implemented in and include the use of custom scorecards to forecast defaults as well as losses within our consumer portfolio  creation of a default model based off of historical data to help determine credit costs  and 
table of contents creation of a foundation for risk based capital allocation using the markov model 
these initiatives have and will continue to help in refining our capital allocation for estimated loan losses 
the provision for loan losses totaled  in  an increase of  from at december   the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was as compared to at year end the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans at december  was compared to at december  the higher provision in  as compared to  was primarily due to three items the impact of the charge off of the  lending relationship during the fourth quarter of this relationship is described further below 
additionally  we experienced a higher level of charge offs in our consumer portfolio  particularly in the areas of indirect marine and recreational vehicle loans  which had net charge offs of  compared to in partially offsetting these items were net recoveries in of for commercial mortgage and commercial construction and development real estate credits  as opposed to net charge offs of for these loans make up of our portfolio at december  the fourth quarter includes the charge off of the previously mentioned  lending relationship 
on december   we instituted legal action against our borrower 
subsequent to our legal action  a number of developments occurred that led us to reevaluate the likelihood of collection 
this resulted in our decision to charge off the entire lending relationship 
those developments include the filing of eleven other collection suits  including six by other financial institutions 
as the result of an investigation by the state of florida  a state court in florida has appointed a receiver to take over the operations of our borrower 
as of february   the receiver has found that our borrower owes  to individuals that purchased an employee investment savings account and an additional  in a stock program 
the florida regulators have called the program a massive fraud 
this is in addition to the claims that have been made by the various financial institutions 
as of february   the total of all claims filed against our borrower total almost  of which ours comprises approximately  the relationship to this borrower began in as a part of a strategy to originate out of market credits through a broker network 
there are no other loans remaining in our portfolio from that strategy 
we are actively pursuing our rights and remedies to collect the outstanding balance of the loans  as well as accrued interest and legal and other fees 
the higher provision in  as compared to  was primarily due to three items the establishment of a specific reserve against the loan to a regional grocery store chain 
when this loan was paid off in  we charged off  we reclassified approximately  of under performing loans to loans held for sale and recorded  in charge offs and related provision expense during the second quarter of  and consumer bankruptcies increased during the fourth quarter largely attributed to the october passage of new bankruptcy laws  coupled with rising fuel prices  increased minimum credit card payments by many issuers  and other economic factors contributed to an increase in consumer net charge offs of from the increase came primarily from the indirect recreational vehicle portfolio 
net charge offs to average loans for increased to basis points compared to basis points in the  charge off recorded during the fourth quarter of the year represented basis points of the basis point increase in the increase from to basis points was attributed to the effects of the loan sale  the charge offs from which totaled basis points  and increases in commercial and consumer charge offs  partially offset by a reduction in net residential mortgage charge offs

in july  we issued  of floating rate capital securities as a participant in a pooled trust preferred fund 
the trust preferred securities have a liquidation amount of  per security with a variable per annum rate equal to six month libor plus with interest payable semiannually 
the issue matures on july  issuance costs of were paid by us and are being amortized over the life of the securities 
we have the right to call these securities at par effective july  during the second quarter of  we issued an additional  in trust preferred securities as a participant in a pooled fund with a floating interest rate of three month libor plus 
the issue matures on june  issuance costs of  were paid by us and are being amortized over the life of the debt 
we have the right to call these securities at par effective june  we continuously review our liability composition 
any modifications could adversely affect our profitability and capital levels over the near term  but would be undertaken if we believe that restructuring the balance sheet will improve our interest rate risk and liquidity risk profile on a longer term basis 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we have obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
our long term borrowings represent fhlb advances with various terms and rates collateralized primarily by first mortgage loans and certain specifically assigned securities  securities sold under repurchase agreements  notes payable secured by equipment  subordinated debt and trust preferred securities 
we are also committed under various operating leases for premises and equipment 
in the normal course of our business  there are various outstanding commitments and contingencies  including letters of credit and standby letters of credit  that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
our exposure to credit loss in the event the nonperformance by the other party to the commitment is limited to the contractual amount 
many commitments expire without being used 
therefore  the amounts stated below do not 
table of contents necessarily represent future cash commitments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for other on balance sheet instruments

we and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial statements 
capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios that measure capital against assets and certain off balance sheet items 
certain ratios weight these assets based on risk characteristics according to regulatory accounting practices 
at december  and  we and integra bank exceeded the regulatory minimums and integra bank met the regulatory definition of well capitalized 
see additional discussion in note capital trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier capital for the parent holding company under federal reserve guidelines 
as a result of the issuance of fasb interpretation no 
fin  the federal reserve adopted a rule that allows the limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in tier capital  subject to stricter qualitative limits 

table of contents liquidity liquidity of a banking institution reflects the ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and other borrowings and to protect us against interest rate volatility 
we continuously monitor our current and prospective business activity in order to match maturities of specific categories of short term and long term loans and investments with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
the primary sources of short term asset liquidity for integra bank include federal funds sold  commercial paper  interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions and securities available for sale 
short term asset liquidity is also provided by scheduled principal paydowns and maturing loans and securities 
the balance between these sources and the need to fund loan demand and deposit withdrawals is monitored under our capital markets policy 
when these sources are not adequate  we may use federal fund purchases  brokered deposits  repurchase agreements  sales of investment securities or utilize our borrowing capacity with the fhlb 
at december  and  federal funds sold and other short term investments were  and  respectively 
additionally  at december   we had  available from unused federal funds lines and in excess of  in unencumbered securities available for repurchase agreements or liquidation 
we also have access to funds from the federal reserve bank totaling  as part of its borrower in custody program 
for the parent holding company  liquidity is provided by dividends from integra bank  cash balances  credit line availability  liquid assets  proceeds from employee exercises of stock options and proceeds from capital market transactions 
federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that national banks can make to their holding companies without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
a national bank s dividend paying capacity is affected by several factors  including the amount of its net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and net profits for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration 
we also have an unsecured line of credit available which permits us to borrow up to  there was no balance outstanding on this line at december  liquidity for the parent holding company is required to support its operational expenses  pay taxes  meet outstanding debt and trust preferred securities obligations  provide dividends to shareholders  fund stock repurchases and other general corporate purposes 
the board of directors has approved a dividend payout ratio of to of net earnings 
we believe that funds to fulfill these obligations for the foreseeable future will be available from currently available cash and marketable securities  dividends from integra bank  the credit line availability  or other sources that management expects to be available during the year 
we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs  and are currently in process of evaluating alternatives to fund the cash portion of the prairie acquisition  which is expected to approximate  accounting changes for information regarding accounting standards issued which will be adopted in future periods  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the exposure of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in rates affect earnings by changing net interest income and other interest sensitive income and expense levels 
interest rate changes affect the market value of capital by altering the underlying value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
our interest rate risk management program is comprised of several components 
the components include board of directors oversight  senior management oversight  risk limits and control  risk identification and measurement  risk monitoring and reporting and independent review 
we strive to manage the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and capital through our interest rate risk management processes 
we manage interest rate risk with oversight through the alco and finance committee of the board of directors  or board alco 
the board alco meets at least twice a quarter and is responsible for the establishment of policies  risk limits and authorization levels 
a committee comprised of senior officers  the corporate alco committee  meets at least quarterly and is responsible for implementing policies and procedures  overseeing the entire interest rate risk management process and establishing internal controls 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored on a proactive basis by utilizing a simulation model 
we use the following key methodologies to measure interest rate risk 
earnings at risk ear 
we consider ear to be our best measure for managing short term interest rate risk one year time frame 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net interest income that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
we use a simulation model to run immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a month horizon by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
additional yield curve scenarios are tested from time to time to assess the risk to changes in the slope of the yield curve and changes in basis relationships 
these interest rate scenarios are executed against a balance sheet utilizing projected growth and composition 
additional simulations are run from time to time to assess the risk to earnings and liquidity from balance sheet growth occurring faster or slower than anticipated as well as the impact of faster or slower prepayments in the loan and securities portfolio 
this simulation model projects the net interest income forecasted under each scenario and calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in one year ear from the base interest rate scenario of minus percent to a basis point rate shock in either direction 
at december   we would experience a positive change in ear  if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  we would experience a negative change in net interest income 
both simulation results are within the policy limits established by the board alco 
rising interest rates caused mortgage prepayments to decline which had a positive impact to ear in the down basis point scenario in relative to the small increase in ear in the up basis point scenario is a reflection of the migration of deposit accounts to higher interest bearing money market accounts that are more market rate sensitive  aging of fixed rate debt  and slower prepayment assumptions extension risk on mortgage related securities and mortgage loans 
the impact of these more rate sensitive liabilities was offset by growth in variable rate commercial loans so that the net impact to ear was small 
trends in earnings at risk estimated change in ear from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  december  economic value of equity eve 
we consider eve to be our best analytical tool for measuring long term interest rate risk 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net equity that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
we use a simulation model to evaluate the impact of immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on eve by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
this simulation model projects the estimated economic value of assets and liabilities under each scenario 
the difference between the economic value of total assets and the economic value of total liabilities is referred to as the economic value of 
table of contents equity 
the simulation model calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
for eve calculations  future balance sheet composition is not a factor 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in eve 
the variance limit for eve is measured in an environment when the base interest rate scenario is shocked up or down basis points within a range of plus or minus 
at december   we would experience a positive change in eve if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  we would experience a negative change in eve 
both of these measures are within board approved policy limits 
the year to year change in the downward rate scenario is largely the result of the decrease in assumed prepayment speeds on mortgage related securities due to the steady rise in interest rates and the migration of deposits to more rate sensitive money market accounts 
likewise  the same factors caused eve risk in the basis point scenario to increase slightly from december  trends in economic value of equity estimated change in eve from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  december  the assumptions in any of these simulation runs are inherently uncertain 
any simulation cannot precisely estimate net interest income or economic value of the assets and liabilities or predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or on the economic value of the assets and liabilities 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  the difference between actual experience and the characteristics assumed  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies
