item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview parkway is a self administered and self managed reit specializing in the acquisition  operations  leasing and ownership of office properties 
the company is geographically focused on the southeastern and southwestern united states and chicago 
as of january  parkway owned or had an interest in office properties located in states with an aggregate of approximately million square feet of leasable space 
included in the portfolio are properties totaling million square feet that are owned jointly with other investors  representing of the portfolio 
under the company s gear up plan  which started january  and ends december   it is the company s goal to transform its strategy from being an owner operator to being an operator owner 
the strategy highlights the company s strength in providing excellent service in the operation of office properties in addition to its direct ownership of real estate assets 
fee based real estate services are offered through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  parkway realty services llc  which also manages and or leases approximately million square feet for third party owners as of january  the company generates revenue primarily by leasing office space to its customers and providing management and leasing services to third party office property owners including joint venture interests 
the primary drivers behind parkway s revenues are occupancy  rental rates and customer retention 
occupancy 
parkway s revenues are dependent on the occupancy of its office buildings 
as a result of job losses and over supply of office properties during through  vacancy rates increased nationally and in parkway s markets 
in  the office sector began to recover from high vacancy rates due to improving job creation 
as of january   occupancy of parkway s office portfolio was compared to as of october  and as of january  not included in the january  occupancy rate are signed leases totaling  square feet  which commence during the first through third quarters of and will raise parkway s percentage leased to 
to combat rising vacancy  parkway utilizes innovative approaches to produce new leases 
these include the broker bill of rights  a short form service agreement and customer advocacy programs which are models in the industry and have helped the company maintain occupancy around during a time when the national occupancy rate is approximately 
parkway projects occupancy ranging from to during for its office properties 
rental rates 
an increase in vacancy rates has the effect of reducing market rental rates and vice versa 
parkway s leases typically have three to seven year terms 
as leases expire  the company replaces the existing leases with new leases at the current market rental rate 
customer retention 
keeping existing customers is important as high customer retention leads to increased occupancy  less downtime between leases  and reduced leasing costs 
parkway estimates that it costs five to six times more to replace an existing customer with a new one than to retain the customer 
in making this estimate  parkway takes into account the sum of revenue lost during downtime on the space plus leasing costs  which rise as market vacancies increase 
therefore  parkway focuses a great deal of energy on customer retention 
parkway s operating philosophy is based on the premise that it is in the customer retention business 
parkway seeks to retain its customers by continually focusing on operations at its office properties 
the company believes in providing superior customer service  hiring  training  retaining and empowering each employee  and creating an environment of open communication both internally and externally with customers and stockholders 
over the past ten years  parkway maintained an average customer retention rate 
parkway s customer retention for the year ending december  was compared to for the year ending december  page of strategic planning 
we continue to see parkway defined as a focused office reit with a hands on  service oriented approach  a disciplined asset allocation program and a willingness to recycle assets 
however  we see the future transformation taking parkway from being an owner operator to being an operator owner 
on january   the company initiated a new three year operating plan referred to as the gear up plan that will serve as the spring board to transform parkway from being first an owner of real estate and secondarily an operator of real estate for others to being first an operator of real estate for others that also owns an interest in the real estate 
the goals of the gear up plan are as follows great people 
great customer service starts with hiring great people  training them well and retaining them 
it will take great people to accomplish the ambitious goals of the plan 
equity opportunities 
over the last several years management has created a broad array of equity opportunities for parkway 
on the private equity side this includes the use of discretionary funds  such as the fund with ohio pers  and partnerships 
the judicious use of private equity provides a greater return on equity to the public shareholders 
parkway intends to contribute assets from its balance sheet to form new joint ventures and expects these subsequent ventures to be similar to discretionary funds in their duration and economics 
on the public equity side  this includes the judicious use of common equity and preferred equity to manage the balance sheet and growth 
asset recycling 
the company has demonstrated its willingness in the past to sell assets when management believed the time was right 
at the start of the gear up plan  parkway identified buildings in twelve markets  totaling approximately million rentable square feet to be part of the asset recycling program 
most of these properties are smaller assets or located in smaller markets that do not fit with the company strategy of owning larger assets in institutional markets 
the dispositions that are planned will help align the company s portfolio with its current acquisition criteria  which focuses on larger properties in institutional markets 
in most cases  parkway will seek to keep a to joint venture interest in the properties being recycled and retain management and leasing agreements 
this is a fluid list of assets based on the company s evaluation of specific market conditions and review of the portfolio 
the other side of asset recycling is the reinvestment of proceeds from dispositions into other assets  either owned in the fee simple format or owned jointly with a partner 
these two goals  equity opportunities and asset recycling  are what combine to transform parkway from being an owner operator to being an operator owner 
management strongly believes that these actions will result in parkway better leveraging its core strength of operating office properties and will be advantageous for the company s shareholders over the long term 
retain customers 
customer retention remains the cornerstone of the company s business and is why partners choose to partner with parkway 
the goal is a customer retention rate of to 
for the year ended december   parkway s customer retention rate was uncompromising focus on operations 
parkway is reaffirming its commitment to do that which it does best  and that is to operate office properties for maximum returns 
performance 
in the planning process  management first decided what actions to take strategically over the three years of the gear up plan and secondly  modeled the economic impact of these actions 
given the large component of asset recycling in the plan  management selected a financial metric that would be most appropriate to measure the success of the plan 
this led to the adoption of cumulative adjusted funds available for distribution cumulative adjusted fad as the metric for the gear up plan  with a target of per share cumulative over three years 
actual adjusted fad for exceeded the amount projected by the company by 
per diluted share 
additionally  parkway established a self imposed limit for the modified fixed charge coverage ratio of times as a pledge not to use leverage to achieve company goals 
for the gear up plan parkway is not abandoning funds from operations  but rather carrying it a step further to include accountability for capital items and removing the accounting adjustments which are not directly influenced by the operations of its properties 
management believes an adjusted fad goal provides an effective alignment with the shareholders by focusing the team on maximizing income from operations while being mindful of capital expenses and ultimately the funds available to page of cover the dividend 
cumulative adjusted fad is calculated as the sum of adjusted fad for each of the three years of the plan 
the adjustments that will be made to fad reported each quarter principally include charges for impairment of value and expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt 
parkway has made progress on its asset recycling and equity opportunities goals in as follows dispositions

investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 
parkway is committed to forming joint ventures with best partners for the purpose of acquiring office assets in the southeastern and southwestern united states and chicago 
we believe these investments result in a higher return on equity than owned assets 
parkway will operate  manage and lease the properties on a day to day basis  provide acquisition and construction management services to the joint venture  and receive fees for providing these services 
the joint venture partner will provide to of the joint venture capital  with parkway to provide the balance 
in  investment in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million or 
the decrease is primarily due to the sale of the viad corporate center  of which parkway owned  on june  the company and its joint venture partner sold the viad corporate center in phoenix  arizona for million 
the buyer assumed the existing mortgage debt of million in the sale 
the company received cash proceeds from the sale of approximately million and recognized a gain of million

rents receivable and other assets 
rents receivable and other assets increased million or for the year ending december  the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in escrow bank account balances of million and unamortized lease costs due to the purchase of office properties in in  the total purchase price allocated to lease costs was million 
the increase in escrow bank account balances of million is primarily due to additional escrow deposit requirements with the new mortgage placed in connection with the purchase of one illinois center on july  and current period escrow deposit requirements for consolidated properties 
the one illinois center escrow funds will be released based on actual expenditures incurred in leasing and operating the building and as predefined in the loan agreement 
intangible assets  net 
for the year ending december   intangible assets net of related amortization increased million or and was primarily due to the allocation of the purchase price of office property acquisitions to above market in place leases and the value of in place leases offset by annual amortization 
in  the total purchase price allocated to above market in place leases and the value of in place leases was million and million  respectively 
parkway accounts for its acquisitions of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to acquired tangible and intangible assets 
notes payable to banks 
notes payable to banks increased million or for the year ending december  at december   notes payable to banks totaled million and resulted primarily from advances under bank lines of credit to purchase additional properties and to make improvements to office properties 
on april  the company closed a new million credit facility led by wachovia bank and syndicated to nine other banks 
this line replaced the previous million revolver  which was to mature in february the facility is comprised of a million term loan maturing in april and a million revolving loan maturing in april the interest rate on the million line is based on libor plus to basis points  depending upon overall company leverage 
the company page of paid a facility fee of  basis points and origination fees of  basis points upon closing of the loan agreement 
additionally  the company pays an annual administration fee of  and fees on the unused portion of the revolver ranging between and basis points based upon overall company leverage 
this new line affords the company greater financial flexibility and lower interest cost 
the company s million unsecured credit facility requires compliance with a number of restrictive financial covenants  including tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio  unencumbered interest coverage ratio  total debt to total asset ratio  secured debt to total asset value ratio  secured recourse debt to total asset value ratio and unencumbered pool restrictions 
as of december  the company was in compliance with these financial covenants 
mortgage notes payable

the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of  with interest only payments for five years and principal payments based on a year amortization thereafter 
in connection with the first mortgage  the company delivered million in letters of credit to satisfy the various escrow requirements made by the lender 
these letters of credit expire june  additional purchase funding was provided by a million secured recourse mezzanine loan with a six month term at an interest rate of libor plus basis points  and amounts drawn under existing lines of credit 
as of december   the balance of the mezzanine loan was zero and was paid using funds received from the sale of the central station building and funds received from the december stock offering

payments during the first five years of the mortgage term will be on an interest only basis and the loan matures june  on december   the renaissance center was acquired subject to an existing non recourse first mortgage with an outstanding balance of approximately million  which matures june  and carries a fixed interest rate of 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the mortgage was recorded at million to reflect the fair value of the instrument based on the market rate of on the date of purchase

in accordance with gaap  the mortgage was recorded at million to reflect the fair value of the instrument based on the market rate of on the date of purchase 
the company expects to continue seeking fixed rate  non recourse mortgage financing with maturities from five to ten years typically amortizing over to years on select office building investments as additional capital is needed 
the company targets a debt to total market capitalization rate at a percentage in the range of to 
this rate may vary at times pending acquisitions  sales and or equity offerings 
in addition  volatility in the price of the company s common stock may affect the debt to total market capitalization ratio 
however  over time the company plans to maintain a percentage in the range of to 
the company calculates this ratio by including its proportionate share of any debt on assets held in funds and partnerships 
in addition to this debt ratio  the company monitors interest  fixed charge and modified fixed charge coverage ratios 
the interest coverage ratio is computed by comparing the cash interest accrued to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is computed by comparing the cash interest accrued  principal payments made on mortgage loans and page of preferred dividends paid to ebitda 
the modified fixed charge coverage ratio is computed by comparing cash interest accrued and preferred dividends paid to ebitda 
in accordance with the gear up plan  parkway has established a self imposed limit for the modified fixed charge coverage ratio of times as the company s pledge not to use leverage to achieve company goals 
management believes the debt to market capitalization  interest coverage  fixed charge coverage and modified fixed charge coverage ratios provide useful information on total debt levels as well as the company s ability to cover interest  principal and or preferred dividend payments with current income 
the computation of the interest  fixed charge and modified fixed charge coverage ratios and the reconciliation of net income to ebitda are as follows for the year ended december  and in thousands year ended december net income adjustments to net income interest expense amortization of financing costs prepayment expenses early extinguishment of debt depreciation and amortization amortization of share based compensation gain on sale of joint venture interests  real estate and other assets tax expense ebitda adjustments unconsolidated joint ventures ebitda adjustments minority interest in real estate partnerships ebitda interest coverage ratio ebitda interest expense interest expense capitalized interest interest expense unconsolidated joint ventures interest expense minority interest in real estate partnerships total interest expense interest coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda fixed charges interest expense preferred dividends preferred distributions unconsolidated joint ventures principal payments excluding early extinguishment of debt principal payments unconsolidated joint ventures principal payments minority interest in real estate partnerships total fixed charges fixed charge coverage ratio modified fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda modified fixed charges interest expense preferred dividends preferred distributions unconsolidated joint ventures total fixed charges modified fixed charge coverage ratio page of parkway defines ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  losses on early extinguishment of debt and other gains and losses 
ebitda  as calculated by us  is not comparable to ebitda reported by other reits that do not define ebitda exactly as we do 
the company believes that ebitda helps investors and parkway s management analyze the company s ability to service debt and pay cash distributions 
however  the material limitations associated with using ebitda as a non gaap financial measure compared to cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities are that ebitda does not reflect the company s historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures or the cash required to make interest and principal payments on the company s outstanding debt 
although ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  the company compensates for the limitations by only using ebitda to supplement gaap financial measures 
additionally  the company believes that investors should consider ebitda in conjunction with net income and the other required gaap measures of its performance and liquidity to improve their understanding of parkway s operating results and liquidity 
parkway views ebitda primarily as a liquidity measure and  as such  the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is cash flows provided by operating activities 
because ebitda is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
the following table reconciles ebitda to cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  and in thousands year ended december ebitda amortization of above market leases operating distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures interest expense prepayment expense early extinguishment of debt tax expense increase in receivables and other assets increase decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities adjustments for minority interests adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures cash flows provided by operating activities accounts payable and other liabilities 
during  accounts payable and other liabilities increased million or 
the increase is primarily due to the allocation of purchase price of office property acquisitions to below market in place leases in the amount of million and the increase in accrued property taxes for the year in the amount of million  which is mainly attributable to the purchase of one illinois center in chicago  illinois in minority interest real estate partnerships 
during the year ending december   minority interest associated with real estate partnerships increased million 
the increase is attributable to parkway s purchase  through affiliated entities  of the limited partner s interest in mbalp on march   which raised parkway s total effective ownership interest in mbalp to  and ohio pers minority interest share of additional investments made by the fund

the letters of credit expire june  critical accounting estimates general 
parkway s investments are generally made in office properties 
therefore  the company is generally subject to risks incidental to the ownership of real estate 
some of these risks include changes in supply or demand for office properties or tenants for such properties in an area in which we have buildings  changes in real estate tax rates  and changes in federal income tax  real estate and zoning laws 
the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of parkway properties  inc  its majority owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which the company has a controlling interest 
parkway also consolidates subsidiaries where the entity is a variable interest entity and parkway is the primary beneficiary  as defined in fasb interpretation r consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of the company s significant accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies due to the increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
parkway considers critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following impairment or disposal of long lived assets  depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate  initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired  and allowance for doubtful accounts impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in the supply or demand of tenants for our properties could impact our ability to fill available space 
should a significant amount of available space exist for an extended period  our investment in a particular office building may be impaired 
we evaluate our real estate assets upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the carrying amount 
real estate assets are classified as held for sale or held and used in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company records assets held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered 
a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
fair value is based on the estimated and realizable contract sales price if available for the asset less estimated costs to sell 
if a sales price is not available  the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset for the remaining useful life are used to determine if the carrying value is recoverable 
the cash flow estimates are based on assumptions about employing the asset for its remaining useful life 
factors considered in projecting future cash flows include but are not limited to existing leases  future leasing and terminations  market rental rates  capital improvements  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  inflation and other known variables 
upon impairment  the company would recognize an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to our estimate of its fair value 
the estimate of fair value and cash flows to be generated from properties requires us to make assumptions 
if one or more assumptions prove incorrect or if the assumptions change  the recognition of an impairment loss on one or more properties may be necessary in the future  which would result in a decrease in net income 
parkway recorded an impairment loss on equity securities in the amount of  in and an impairment loss on acres of land in new orleans  louisiana in the amount of  in no impairment losses were recorded in page of depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate 
depreciation of buildings and parking garages is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
depreciation of building improvements is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
if our estimate of useful lives proves to be incorrect  the depreciation expense recognized would also be incorrect 
therefore  a change in the estimated useful lives assigned to buildings and improvements would result in either an increase or decrease in depreciation expense  which would result in an increase or decrease in earnings 
initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired 
parkway accounts for its acquisitions of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building  garage  building improvements and tenant improvements  identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above and below market leases  customer relationships  lease costs and the value of in place leases and any value attributable to above or below market debt assumed with the acquisition 
parkway allocates the purchase price of properties to tangible and intangible assets based on fair values 
the company determines the fair value of the tangible and intangible components using a variety of methods and assumptions all of which result in an approximation of fair value 
differing assumptions and methods could result in different estimates of fair value and thus  a different purchase price allocation and corresponding increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating expense recoveries due from customers 
change in the supply of or demand for office properties could impact our customers ability to honor their lease obligations  which could in turn affect our recorded revenues and estimates of the collectibility of our receivables 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized and accrued as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as credit quality of our customers  delinquency of payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for customer balances that are over days past due and for specific customer receivables for which collection is considered doubtful 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
funds from operations management believes that funds from operations available to common shareholders ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits and computes this measure in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments to derive the company s pro rata share of ffo of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures 
further  the company does not adjust ffo to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges 
the company believes that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses 
however  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization  among other items  from net income  as defined by gaap 
the company believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required gaap presentations  has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful 
ffo as reported by parkway may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition 
funds from operations do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
page of the following table presents a reconciliation of the company s net income to ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands  except per share data total dollar amount diluted per share year ended year ended december december net income adjustments to derive funds from operations depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization discontinued operations minority interest depreciation and amortization adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures preferred dividends convertible preferred dividends gain on real estate and joint venture interests minority interest unit holders diluted share adjustment for convertible preferred stock funds from operations applicable to common shareholders inflation except for insurance and utilities  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
additionally  most of the leases require the customers to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company s leases typically have three to seven year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at market base rent  which may be higher or lower than the existing lease rate 
insurance 
following the devastating hurricanes of and  the insurance market for properties located in coastal and wind prone areas of the country has been volatile 
the company s current property and casualty insurance policy for most properties has been in place since november  and is scheduled to renew april   at which time these lines of coverage will be renewed under the market conditions that exist at that time 
the company expects that the cost of property coverage in some of its markets could increase compared to the current cost 
there may also be a reduced capacity by insurance providers to fully cover the replacement value of properties in certain geographic regions 
any increase in insurance costs directly related to each property will be passed through to customers to the extent allowed by the lease terms 
utilities 
energy costs in most of our markets have increased over the past months at a higher rate than the overall rate of inflation 
the company has undertaken several initiatives to conserve energy and to educate our customers on the importance of conservation in controlling the operating cost of our properties 
the increase in energy costs have been passed through to customers to the extent allowed by the terms of each customer s lease agreement 
the company estimates that approximately of the increase in energy costs is paid by the customers
