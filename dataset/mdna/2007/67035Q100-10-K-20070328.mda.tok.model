item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
some of the information detailed in this management s discussion and analysis contain forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements and risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we develop  manufacture and commercialize innovative medical products that fight infection and inflammation based on our noble metal nanocrystalline technology 
our patented technology enables us to convert silver s microcrystalline structure into an atomically disordered nanocrystalline coating 
we believe that this conversion can enhance silver s natural antimicrobial properties and that currently marketed products with our silcryst coatings meet important patient needs 
in addition  our nanocrystalline silver structures have exhibited potent anti inflammatory properties in preclinical studies 
we produce our nanocrystalline silver as a coating for medical devices under the trademark silcryst and as a powder for use as an active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  which we refer to as npi in september  we completed a phase clinical trial of npi while the clinical trial did not meet its primary efficacy end point  as discussed below  we still believe npi may be useful for treating a wide range of infectious and inflammatory diseases 
we have developed and received regulatory clearance to market four products using our silcryst coating for the advanced wound care market 
in may  we licensed to smith nephew plc smith nephew  a global medical device company  the exclusive worldwide right to market  distribute and sell products using our silcryst coatings technology in products that are designed and indicated solely for the prevention  protection and or treatment of non minor dermal wounds or burns in humans the field  including improvements to those products  and any new products with our silcryst coating in the field 
smith nephew markets products with our silcryst coating in over countries around the world  including the united states  under its acticoat trademark 
acticoat products using silcryst coatings are used for a wide variety of wound types by hospitals  clinics  burn centers  doctors offices  home healthcare agencies and nursing homes 
we believe that the demand for acticoat products with our silcryst coatings licensed to smith nephew is and will be driven by demographic factors  including population aging  the incidence of medical conditions such as diabetes and obesity  by the displacement of traditional wound care products that we believe are clinically less effective than products using our silcryst coatings  by the introduction of acticoat products using our silcryst coatings to new countries and for new applications  and by the degree to which smith nephew is successful in selling and marketing these products 
our results of operations currently depend substantially on acticoat product sales generated by smith nephew  which is our only customer 
revenues under our agreements with smith nephew consist of manufacturing cost reimbursements  royalties  payments upon the achievement of specified milestones and reimbursement for costs incurred in connection with the development of and improvement to silcryst coated products covered by the agreements 
smith nephew reimburses us for the cost of manufacturing the products we sell to them  including certain direct costs such as direct material  direct labor  labeling  testing and packaging  and smith nephew s proportionate share of indirect costs related to acticoat products relating to manufacturing and the manufacturing facilities  including administration  labor  rent  insurance  utilities  repairs and quality control 
on february   smith nephew reported its annual results for wound care 
smith nephew reported acticoat sales growth of in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter and for the year as compared to the year smith nephew has previously announced that market conditions in the advanced wound care market  including the silver dressing segment  have become more competitive due in part to increased competition and customer cost containment efforts 
we are uncertain as to whether or the extent to which this increased competition will have a negative impact on acticoat product sales growth and our revenues in the near future  as it will depend on future events  including smith nephew s response to market conditions 
any termination of or significant disruption in our agreements or relationship with smith nephew  or a significant reduction in sales of acticoat products  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our manufacturing costs are recorded both as offsetting expense and revenue items on the consolidated statement of operations upon shipment to smith nephew 
in addition  although we are required to fund the up front costs of capital expenditures to acquire equipment used to manufacture acticoat products  we are entitled under our agreements to recoup those costs over time through reimbursement for depreciation expense 
smith nephew is not required to reimburse us for any costs incurred for acquiring or 
table of contents improving owned real property  buildings or similar improvements 
smith nephew s obligation to reimburse us in any calendar year for fixed costs that are within our control or the control of our affiliates including the westaim corporation  other than costs incurred at the request of smith nephew  is capped at the greater of a fixed percent and the increase in the canadian consumer price index 
we currently purchase most of our raw materials from single suppliers 
the loss of any of these suppliers could result in a disruption in our production while we arrange for a replacement supplier 
to reduce this risk  we maintain sufficient inventory levels to continue production for approximately six months 
the price paid for the products by smith nephew is equal to our fully allocated cost of goods sold including equipment depreciation 
at the end of the third quarter of  based on smith nephew s demand forecasts  we began construction of an expansion of our fort saskatchewan production facility with an estimated cost of approximately million 
in accordance with our agreements  we are funding the up front costs of the capital expenditures required to acquire the new production equipment associated with this expansion 
we are entitled to recoup these costs over time from smith nephew through reimbursement for depreciation expense  the payments of which are typically spread out over a number of years 
accordingly  scaling up our manufacturing capability has required that we make substantial up front cash expenditures for which we will not be reimbursed for a period of several years 
we expect the capacity expansion to be completed by the middle of  however  at the current rate of acticoat product sales growth  the new manufacturing capacity may not be required as early as we expected when we undertook the expansion 
we record our royalty revenues upon the sale of our products by smith nephew to its customers 
our royalty revenue varies in proportion to increases or decreases in smith nephew s sales of its acticoat products 
in that regard  smith nephew has authority to unilaterally determine the selling price for its acticoat products 
moreover  although smith nephew has agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to market acticoat products  smith nephew is not required to purchase any significant amount of product from us 
in may  in accordance with the agreements  the contractual royalty rate increased and from that date has remained and  under the terms of the agreements  is to remain constant for the life of the agreements  subject only to i the possibility of a negotiated arbitrator awarded reduction in royalty rates on sales in countries where patent protection has been lost and a competing product is being sold that would have infringed our patent rights had they been in effect  ii the possibility of a negotiated reduction in royalty rates on sales of a particular acticoat product where smith nephew does not realize industry standard gross profit margins on sales of such products  or iii a reduced royalty rate in respect of sales of acticoat products in certain countries  including the united states  upon the expiration of patent rights to our silcryst coating in such country 
upon the expiration of certain patents beginning in  we may be required to implement royalty reductions in respect of certain products in certain countries in which the patents have expired 
it is also possible that  from time to time  certain products may fall within category ii above on a temporary basis and  while we are not obligated to agree to royalty reductions in those circumstances  we may choose to do so if we determine it is appropriate under the circumstances 
we also receive milestone payments upon smith nephew s achievement of specified sales levels of acticoat products and upon the achievement of regulatory events specified in our agreements with smith nephew 
the achievement of both of these events is out of our control and  therefore  it is uncertain as to whether or when we will earn future milestone payments 
the maximum amount of milestone payments that we may receive under the smith nephew agreements  including the million of milestone payments we have already received  is million 
no milestone payments were earned from smith nephew for the year ended december  a million milestone payment was earned in the timing and receipt of a milestone payment affects the comparability of period to period results and may have a material effect on financial results 
for example  without the milestone payments we earned in and  we would have reported a net loss of million in and million in  rather than net loss of million in and net income of million in excluding milestone payments  our wound care product revenue for the year ended december  increased by over the year ended december   by in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   by in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   and by in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  smith nephew reimburses us for costs and expenses incurred in connection with approved research and development activities for the development of new products and improvements to existing products covered by our agreements with smith nephew 
all payments under our agreements with smith nephew are made to us in us dollars 
in calculating sales levels for milestone payments  and for other purposes under the agreements  sales by smith nephew in currencies other than the us dollar are converted to the us dollar based on the average exchange rate for the prior quarter 

table of contents the exclusive right we granted to smith nephew to market  distribute or sell products with our silcryst coatings in the field does not apply to other types of products that we may develop using our technology  including  among other things  the products we are developing using npi or silcryst coated implants 
we are developing pharmaceutical products to extend our nanocrystalline silver technology to the treatment of infectious and inflammatory conditions 
prior to the completion of our most recent phase study  our lead pharmaceutical product candidate was a topical cream containing npi for the treatment of skin conditions 
in september  we completed and announced the results of our second phase clinical trial of topical npi for the treatment of atopic dermatitis  a form of eczema 
the study demonstrated that the formulations containing our npi were no better than our vehicle without npi in clearing or almost clearing signs of atopic dermatitis 
as a result  we will not continue with clinical trials for this formulation in atopic dermatitis 
however  the study did demonstrate that treatment with npi cream was well tolerated and the incidence of all adverse events was low and was not different among the npi treated groups and the placebo treated patients 
in addition  our npi cream formulation has been shown to be stable  cosmetically acceptable  and to have broad spectrum antimicrobial activity through in vitro testing 
therefore  we believe our npi cream has the potential to treat a variety of skin conditions and we are exploring ways to bring this safe  stable  antimicrobial cream to market 
in furtherance of this initiative  in december  we are pursuing a k with the us food drug administration for our npi cream 
with the cancellation of the clinical program for our topical formulation of npi as a pharmaceutical candidate for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and in view of the slower growth rate of our wound care product revenue in and as compared to the previous years  we intend to make adjustments in the first quarter of to our manufacturing and research operations to conserve cash and control expenses and bring our manufacturing resources into alignment with expected demand from smith nephew for acticoat products 
these adjustments will include reductions in our workforce of approximately of our total employees 
we will be shifting the focus of our research and development efforts from clinical work towards preclinical work for gastrointestinal applications of our nanocrystalline technology and towards establishing a partnership for our npi cream as a k prescription device 
we bear all costs relating to our research and development activities for our prospective products outside of our agreements with smith nephew agreement 
gross margin from silcryst coated wound care products  which we define as revenue excluding milestone payments less manufacturing costs  funds a portion of the development costs for other products 
we are a majority owned subsidiary of the westaim corporation westaim  a canadian company incorporated in alberta  the shares of which are listed on the nasdaq and the toronto stock exchange 
on december   we completed an initial public offering of million common shares for gross proceeds of million 
we used million of net proceeds to partially repay debt to westaim and retained the remaining net proceeds to fund our operations 
in accordance with the terms of the prospectus of our initial public offering  the remaining debt owed to westaim in the amount of million was converted to million common shares on january  westaim has provided us with financial  administrative and other support since our inception 
we will continue to rely on westaim for certain corporate and administrative services in the future 
historically  we have reimbursed westaim for its costs of providing or  in certain cases  for its costs of paying a third party to provide these corporate and administrative services to us 
while the total amount we pay to westaim for these services in the future will vary according to the amount of services provided  the amounts we will pay westaim for these services will be intended  as in the past  to reimburse westaim for its cost of providing these services or for paying a third party to provide those services 
in addition  we pay rent and operating expenses to westaim for our manufacturing facility in fort saskatchewan  alberta 
in the future  we may consider acquisitions of intellectual property or companies engaged in the development or production of drugs or devices to combat infection and inflammation 
however  we currently have no agreements or understandings regarding any acquisitions 
any acquisitions may require that we obtain additional financing 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  wound care product revenue milestone revenue total revenue manufacturing costs gross margin excluding milestone revenue gross margin percent excluding milestone revenue certain milestone revenue may relate in part to sales activity in prior periods 
gross margin excluding milestone revenue is equal to wound care product revenue minus manufacturing costs 
gross margin percent excluding milestone revenue is equal to gross margin excluding milestone revenue divided by wound care product revenue 
year ended december  and december  revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  wound care product revenue which consists of royalty revenues and manufacturing cost reimbursements from smith nephew increased approximately to million for compared to million for due entirely to increased orders from smith nephew to support acticoat product sales growth and smith nephew s decision to increase world wide inventory levels of acticoat products 
we do not expect smith nephew to build further inventory levels of acticoat products in and  as a result  changes in future product revenues should more closely reflect changes in smith nephew s sales of acticoat products 
no milestone payment was earned in the year ended december  and one million milestone payment was earned in our revenue in was reduced by an adjustment of million of manufacturing cost reimbursements that were determined to be non reimbursable 
manufacturing costs 
manufacturing costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is attributable primarily to higher production volumes of acticoat wound care products driven by increased orders from smith nephew to support its acticoat worldwide inventory levels and to support its acticoat sales growth 
in addition  the weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar contributed to the increase in manufacturing costs 
gross margin 
gross margin excluding milestone revenue for the year ended december  was million or compared to million or for the year ended december  we recognize manufacturing revenue when we ship product to smith nephew and recognize royalty income when smith nephew sells our products to its customers 
consequently  our gross margin percent may vary from period to period due to differences in timing of when we ship product to smith nephew and when smith nephew sells product to its customers 
in the year ended december   we shipped substantially higher volumes of acticoat products to smith nephew as compared to the year ended december   and for which the related royalties have not yet been earned due  in part  to smith nephew s program to increase world wide inventory levels in therefore  our gross margin percent for the year ended december  was lower compared to the percent for the year ended december  research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million from to is attributable to the phase dermatological clinical study that was undertaken in and completed in the third quarter of general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is attributable primarily to the administrative costs associated with being a publicly traded company  including directors fees and expenses and higher legal and compliance costs 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased because we had no debt owing to westaim after the conversion of the remaining debt of million to million common shares on january  
table of contents income taxes 
income taxes are recognized for future income tax consequences attributed to estimated differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases 
the income tax recovery reported in our consolidated statements of operations is related to canadian large corporations tax and us alternative minimum tax 
we have net operating loss carry forward for income tax purposes of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  and unclaimed scientific research and experimental development expenditures of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  that can be used to offset taxable income  if any  in future periods 
we also have accumulated capital losses of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  as well as research and development tax credits of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  these recognized losses and credits have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the net operating losses and research and development tax credits will expire at various times to the end of in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  and there can be no assurance when or if this will occur 
management will continue to provide a full valuation allowance until it determines that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized 
our tax pools are subject to review and potential disallowance  in whole or in part  by the canada revenue agency in canada and the internal revenue service in the united states upon audit of our federal income tax returns 
we cannot predict the results of any such review 
furthermore  the amount of net operating loss carryovers  or nols  which may be used by us for us federal income tax purposes in any future year could be limited by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in general  section would limit our ability to use nols for us federal income tax purposes in the event of certain changes  either directly or indirectly  in ownership of our company  including as a result of sales of our common shares by westaim  future offerings of common shares by us  and changes in ownership of westaim 
if such limitations were triggered as a result of future shifts in ownership of us  the use of our nols for us federal income tax purposes would be limited 
any limitation of our use of nols could depending on the extent of such limitation and the amount of nols previously used result in us retaining less cash after payment of us federal income taxes during any year in which we have taxable income rather than losses than we would be entitled to retain if such nols were available as an offset against such income for us federal income tax reporting purposes 
for alternative minimum tax purposes in the united states  nols can be used to offset no more than percent of alternative minimum taxable income  or amti 
thus  to the extent our nols are used to offset regular taxable income  if any  alternative income tax will still be required to be paid on percent of amti at the alternative minimum tax rate of percent 
as noted elsewhere  we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we cannot predict when or if we will generate taxable income and whether and to what extent we will be able to use our nols to offset any such taxable income 
year ended december  and december  revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million is attributable primarily to million in milestone revenue in compared to million in  which was offset in part by increased wound care product revenue in wound care product revenue increased approximately to million for compared to million for the million improvement in wound care product revenue reflects increased orders from  and sales by  smith nephew as their sales of acticoat products continued to grow 
milestone revenues for the year ended december  earned for the achievement of predetermined smith nephew sales threshold of acticoat products were million compared to million in one million milestone payment was earned in the third quarter of and one million milestone payment was earned in each of the first and third quarters of manufacturing costs 
manufacturing costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is attributable primarily to the introduction of new manufacturing capacity in  as well as to higher production volumes of acticoat wound care products driven by increased orders from smith nephew to support its acticoat sales growth 
in addition  the weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar contributed to the increase in manufacturing costs 

table of contents gross margin 
gross margin excluding milestone revenue for the year ended december  was million or compared to million or for the year ended december  the reduction in gross margin percent excluding milestone revenue is primarily the result of an increase in volume of lower margin acticoat products manufactured for  and sold by  smith nephew and the introduction of new manufacturing capacity in research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million from to is attributable to the phase dermatological clinical study that was undertaken in general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs of million for the year ended december  were unchanged from the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense increased primarily because of increased borrowings from westaim to finance our operations and capital projects  including additional manufacturing capacity 
year ended december  and december  revenue 
total revenue for was million compared to million for the increase of million from to is attributable to an increase in both wound care product revenue and milestone revenue 
wound care product revenue increased approximately to million for compared to million for the million improvement in wound care product revenue reflects increased orders from  and sales of acticoat products by  smith nephew 
milestone revenues earned in were million  compared to million in one million milestone payment was earned in each of the first and third quarters of for the achievement of predetermined smith nephew sales thresholds of acticoat products and one milestone payment was earned in the first quarter of for the achievement of a regulatory approval in europe 
manufacturing costs 
manufacturing costs for were million compared to million for the increase of million from to is attributable to higher production volumes for acticoat wound care products driven by increased orders from smith nephew to support its acticoat sales growth 
gross margin 
gross margin excluding milestone revenue for was million or compared to million or in the percentage point increase in gross margin percent is primarily the result of manufacturing economies of scale related to increased volumes of acticoat products manufactured for  and sold by  smith nephew 
research and development costs 
research and development costs for were million compared to million in the increase of million is attributable to increased spending on dermatology research  including the phase clinical trials for npi in general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs for were million compared to million for the increase of million from to is attributable to increased costs resulting from the growth of the silcryst coating manufacturing operations and pharmaceutical research  of which million is due to increased hiring and administrative costs relating to the wound care operations and million is due to increased salaries  wages and consulting fees relating to pharmaceutical research and development 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in interest expense increased by million primarily because in westaim did not charge interest on shareholder advances from westaim  and  to a limited extent  because of increased borrowings from westaim to finance our operations and capital projects  including additional manufacturing capacity 
accordingly  interest expense for was substantially lower than it would have been had interest been charged on all of our indebtedness to westaim 
liquidity and capital resources on december   we completed our initial public offering of million common shares for gross proceeds of million 
we used million of net proceeds to partially repay debt owed to westaim and retained the remaining net proceeds of million to fund our operations 
from our inception through the closing of our initial public offering  we financed our operations 
table of contents through various financing arrangements with westaim 
because westaim no longer intends to provide us with any additional financing or other financial support  we are now required to obtain any necessary financing from third parties 
we currently have no third party debt or lines of credit or other financing arrangements in place with banks or other financial institutions  but we may enter into a line of credit or other financing arrangement in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing as and when required  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the indebtedness to westaim at december  comprised a term loan in the amount of million  which bore interest at a rate of per annum 
on january   this debt was converted to million common shares at per share 
as a result  as at december   we owe no debt to westaim and westaim owns of our common shares 
at the end of the third quarter of  we began construction of an expansion of our fort saskatchewan production facility with an estimated cost of approximately million 
we also intend to continue pharmaceutical product development and expect to have increased working capital requirements to the extent we are successful in increasing our revenues 
in addition  we expect to have capital expenditures of approximately million for pharmaceutical development capital equipment in at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  as compared to million at december  and million at december  cash used in provided from operations amounted to million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash from operations in did not include milestone revenue 
cash from operations included the receipt of milestone revenue in the amount of million in  million in and million in cash used in provided from operations is primarily impacted by operating results and changes in working capital  particularly the timing of the collection of receivables from smith nephew  inventory levels and the timing of payments to suppliers 
cash used in investing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  in each of these years  the most significant use of cash was for capital expenditures  which were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year end december  the increase in capital spending in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was due to a major production expansion at our manufacturing facility in fort saskatchewan  alberta  which was completed in the first half of  and to further production expansion which commenced in the third quarter of during  we spent approximately million on the design of a production facility that meets good manufacturing practices at our fort saskatchewan manufacturing plant 
subsequent to our second phase clinical trial results  we have determined that a facility to manufacture our active pharmaceutical ingredient  npi  is not warranted at this time 
the costs of million were written off in and recorded as a write down of capital assets in our consolidated statement of operations 
cash provided from used in financing activities resulted from proceeds from issuance of common shares as a result of exercises of stock options and from our initial public offering as well as changes in the amount of indebtedness to westaim 
proceeds from issuance of common shares from exercises of stock options amounted to million in the year ended december  net proceeds from our initial public offering in  after fees and expenses  amounted to million 
funding from repayments to westaim was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  funding from westaim was impacted by our operating results  working capital changes and capital expenditures 
in we were able to repay million to westaim due to the receipt of a total of million in milestone payments from smith nephew 
we expect to continue to make investments in our product pipeline and to prepare for regulatory approval and commercial launch of new products 
consequently  we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and commercialize existing and future products 
we also expect to incur increased general and administrative expenses in the future  due in part to the legal  accounting  insurance and other expenses that we will incur as a result of being a public company  and expenses relating to filing  prosecution  defense and enforcements of patent and intellectual property rights 
we expect that our available cash resources will be sufficient to support our current and expected operations  including the expansion of our fort saskatchewan  alberta production facility that began at the end of the third quarter of  our product development initiatives  including additional pharmaceutical development capital equipment  for at least the next months 
however  we will likely be required to obtain additional financing within the next months or afterwards if our cash resources are 
table of contents insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we decide to pursue new product development initiatives collaborations  acquisitions or strategies 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including sales performance of smith nephew s acticoat products  the number  breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates and the occurrence of unexpected developments 
we may seek to raise additional financing through the sale of equity  equity related or debt securities or loans 
the sale of additional equity or equity related securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
debt financing will expose us to risks of leverage  including the risk that we may be unable to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness when due  and that we may be required to pledge our assets as collateral for any debt financing that we obtain 
moreover  additional financing may not be available at times  in amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all  particularly because we have granted a first priority security interest in certain critical patents and other intellectual property to smith nephew 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing as and when required  we may be forced to reduce the scope of  or delay or eliminate  some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization activities and we may also be required to reduce the scale of our operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
contractual commitments and obligations at december  the table below reports commitments and obligations that have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  certain other obligations and commitments  while not required under generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be included in the consolidated balance sheets  may have a material impact on liquidity 
these items  all of which have been entered into in the ordinary course of business  are also included in the table below in order to present a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity 
cash payments due by period less than more than year years years years total in millions consolidated obligations and commitments as of december  facilities operating leases westaim third parties purchase obligations capital operations total obligations and commitments related party transactions we obtain certain corporate and administrative services from westaim and we pay rent and operating expenses on our manufacturing facility in fort saskatchewan  alberta to westaim 
the total cost of these services and our rent and operating expenses was million for the year ended december   million in and million in we have historically reimbursed westaim for the cost of providing or  in certain cases  for the cost of paying a third party to provide these services to us 
these services have included insurance and risk management  cash management  legal  human resources  payroll processing  environmental health and safety  tax and accounting and intellectual property services 
these costs have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
westaim continues to supply these services to us pursuant to a services agreement which provides that we reimburse westaim for the fully allocated costs of providing or for the cost of paying a third party to provide those services 
with limited exceptions  we do not maintain any insurance policies in our own name 
instead  westaim provides insurance coverage to us under its policies  which cover westaim and other entities it controls  and we expect to have this coverage until the termination of the services agreement or that portion of it relating to the provision of insurance to us by westaim or until such time as westaim owns less than of our common shares 
we reimburse westaim for the costs of that coverage under the arrangements described earlier in this paragraph 
in the event we are no longer covered by westaim s insurance policies  we would have to obtain our own insurance policies  which could result in increased costs or reduced insurance coverage 

table of contents the fort saskatchewan building which houses our manufacturing operations and certain research facilities is owned by westaim and leased to us at a rate which  in management s view  approximates the current market rate  plus actual operating costs 
off balance sheet commitments as of december  as of december   our future minimum commitments and contractual obligations included two facilities operating leases 
these items are not required to be recorded on our balance sheet under gaap 
they are disclosed in the table presented above and described more fully in the following paragraphs in order to provide a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity as of december  our fort saskatchewan  alberta facility is rented from westaim under two separate leases covering a total of  square feet of space 
on july   we entered into a lease agreement formalizing the previous rental terms and conditions  which lease has been subsequently amended to  among other things  increase the square footage of the leased space 
of the  square feet of manufacturing  laboratory and office space covered by the lease as amended   square feet is subject to an initial term of years  expiring in the remaining  square feet is subject to an initial year term  expiring june  all of this leased space is subject to up to three five year renewal terms  at renewal rates equal to the greater of fair market value or existing base rent plus alberta cpi consumer price index increases since the last rent was determined 
on december   we entered into a lease agreement with westaim for an additional  square feet of office space for a month term that was subsequently amended to months expiring december  provided that  at our option  this space may be rolled into the unexpired portion of the five year term of july  lease including any rights of renewal 
our future minimum commitments under the fort saskatchewan  alberta lease are approximately million for each of the twelve month periods commencing from january  to the expiry of the lease 
our wakefield  massachusetts offices and laboratory facility are leased from a third party 
the lease term began on july  and will expire on july  there are options to extend for two terms of five years each 
our future minimum commitments under the wakefield  massachusetts lease are million for  million for and for and are included in the table on the previous page 
in the normal course of operations  we may provide indemnifications that are contractual terms to counterparties in transactions such as purchase and sale agreements  service agreements  director officer contracts and leasing transactions 
these indemnification agreements may require us to compensate the counterparties for costs incurred as a result of various events  such as litigation claims of statutory sanctions that may be suffered by the counterparty as a consequence of the transaction 
the terms of the indemnification agreements will vary based upon the agreement  the nature of which prevents us from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount that we could be required to pay counterparties 
historically  we have not made any payments under such indemnifications and no amounts have been accrued in the consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  and useful lives of capital and intangible assets

table of contents year ended december  period end rate period average rate high rate low rate monthly january february march april may june july august september october november december stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas r  share based payment sfas r  which requires that all share based payments to directors and employees  including grants of stock options  be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which required the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was which consisted of stock based compensation expense of related to director and employee stock options and a recovery of related to sars  with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital  or apic  of and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of in addition  stock based compensation of was recognized related to restricted share units awarded to the independent directors 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statement of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  because the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
sfas r requires that liability classified awards such as sars be revalued to estimated fair value at each reporting date using an option pricing model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we valued sars at the amount by which the market value exceeded the exercise price at each measurement date 
as a result of implementing sfas r on january   we increased our sar liability from to  with the increase recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
we continue to use the black scholes option pricing model for valuation of share based payment awards which was previously used for our pro forma information required under sfas our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected common share price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee share option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires that the corporation recognize the impact of a tax position in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
the provisions of fin are effective beginning january  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of deficit

sfas in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas

sfas also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of sfas and sfas sfas is effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning after september  the corporation currently does not have any hybrid financial instruments 
sfas in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements

sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the corporation is currently evaluating the impact sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements 
sab in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach 
the rollover approach quantifies misstatements based on the amount of the error in the current year financial statements whereas the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  irrespective of the misstatement s year s of origin 
financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material 
correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the corporation s fiscal year ending december  
the implementation of sab did not have a material impact on the corporation s financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to various market risks  including variability in currency exchange rates 
the smith nephew sales revenues on which our royalty and milestone revenues are determined are reported to us in us dollars 
sales by smith nephew in other currencies will result in fluctuations in their revenue as reported in us dollars 
the smith nephew contracts ensure recovery of certain manufacturing costs  which reduces our susceptibility to production cost variances resulting from foreign exchange fluctuations 
our accounts receivable from smith nephew are denominated in us dollars 
the functional currency that we use for accounting purposes is the canadian dollar and as a result  accounts receivable and other liabilities recorded in canadian dollars are exposed to changes in the exchange rate between the canadian and us dollars until these receivables are collected 
we do not maintain derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to currency risks as a result of our export to foreign jurisdictions of goods produced in canada 
these risks are partially covered by purchases of goods and services in the foreign currency 
for  a increase in the exchange rate from the united states dollar to the canadian dollar meaning a appreciation in the value of the united states dollar compared to the canadian dollar would have decreased our loss before income taxes by less than million 
conversely  a decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our loss before taxes by a similar amount
