business and industry overview ciber provides information technology it system integration consulting and other it services primarily to governmental agencies and fortune and middle market companies across most major industries 
from offices located throughout the united states and europe  as well as eastern asia  we provide our clients with a broad range of it services  including custom and package software development  maintenance  implementation and integration 
to a lesser extent  we also resell certain it hardware and software products 
our five operating segments  commercial solutions commercial  federal government solutions federal  state local government solutions state local  us package solutions package and european operations european  are organized internally primarily by the nature of their services  client base and geography 
our commercial  federal and state local segments comprise our us based ciber branch offices that provide it services and products in custom developed software environments 
these offices are classified into a segment based on their primary client focus category commercial  federal or state local  however  they also may have clients that fall into another category 
for example  a commercial office may also provide services to a government client 
our india operations are considered part of our commercial segment 
our package segment is comprised of our ciber enterprise solutions division that primarily provides enterprise software implementation services  including erp and supply chain management software from software vendors such as oracle  lawson and sap 
our european segment represents our offices in europe  china  australia and new zealand that provide a broad range of it consulting services  including package software implementation  application development  systems integration and support services 
the majority of our services revenue is recognized under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under fixed price contracts  which currently make up approximately of our services revenue  our revenue is fixed under the contract while our costs to complete our obligations under the contract are variable 
as a result  our profitability on fixed price contracts can vary significantly and occasionally can even be a loss 
changes in our services revenue is primarily a function of hours worked on revenue generating activities and  to a lesser extent  changes in our average rate per hour 
hours worked on revenue producing activities vary with the number of consultants employed and their utilization level 
utilization represents the percentage of time worked on revenue producing engagements divided by the standard hours available ie hours per week 
our average utilization rates are higher in our commercial  federal and state local segments typically around to  as compared to our package and european segments typically around to 
we actively manage both our number of consultants and our overall utilization levels 
if we determine we have excess available resources that we cannot place on billable assignments in the near future  we consider reducing those resources 
as a result  during the last three years  most of our consultant turnover has been from involuntary termination of employment 
the hourly rate we charge for our services varies based on the level of the consultant involved  the particular expertise of the consultant and the geographic area 
our overall average rate per hour is also influenced by the results of our fixed price engagements  which can vary 
our effective average hourly billing rates are highest in our package segment approximately per hour as compared to our european segment approximately per hour and to our commercial  federal and state local segments approximately to per hour 
success or overruns on fixed price contracts can also influence our effective average rate per hour 
in addition  our foreign revenue is impacted by changes in currency exchange rates 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software and commissions on sales of it products 
our sales of it hardware and software generally involve it network infrastructure 
gross profit percentage on other revenues is approximately 
this is a blend of low margin product sales typically to and higher margin product commissions and proprietary software sales 
depending on the mix of these business activities  gross profit percentage on other revenue will fluctuate 
the market demand for ciber s services is heavily dependent on it spending by major corporations  organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve 
the pace of technology change and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide 
business combinations in  we acquired two sap consulting businesses in europe 
also in  we completed the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in novasoft ag 
in  we acquired two small entities  including a single office operation specializing in sap implementations and an india based professional services firm specializing in custom application development 
during  we completed the following significant business combinations acquired company date consultants added goodwill added novasoft ag september million ascent technology group limited may million scb computer technology  inc march million novasoft ag novasoft in late  we acquired approximately of the net outstanding shares of novasoft  headquartered in heidelberg  germany  for total consideration of approximately million in cash and million of ciber common stock 
the cash portion of the payment consideration was primarily funded by borrowing under our bank revolving line of credit 
in  we increased our ownership of novasoft to approximately for an additional million in consideration and expenses 
in  following a lengthy legal process in the german courts  we finally completed the acquisition of the remaining of outstanding shares for a total of million  including expenses 
novasoft is a provider of implementation and other consulting services related to sap software products 
novasoft is an sap alliance partner and implements all of sap s erp products  including mysap 
com products and industry specific applications 
at the time of the acquisition  novasoft had approximately consultants  located mainly in germany  the uk and spain 
we acquired novasoft to expand both our international presence and our capacity to deliver sap related services 
ascent technology group limited ascent based in hinckley  uk  ascent provided it services to medium sized enterprises with a particular focus on software implementation and sales  including both sap and sage erp solutions and microsoft 
net software services 
ascent had also developed and sold its own proprietary customer relationship management software 
the aggregate purchase consideration for ascent included million in cash and million of ciber common stock 
in addition  ascent had certain debt obligations  totaling approximately million  which we repaid shortly after closing the acquisition 
we primarily used a portion of the cash raised from our convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures to fund the cash portion of the purchase consideration and to repay ascent s debt 
scb computer technology  inc scb based in memphis  tennessee  scb provided it services similar to ciber  including consulting  outsourcing and professional staffing  with a particular focus on federal and state government clients 
the aggregate purchase price included million in cash and million in ciber common stock 
in addition  scb had certain debt obligations  totaling approximately million that we repaid shortly after closing the acquisition 
we used a portion of the cash raised from our debentures to fund the cash portion of the purchase consideration and to repay scb s debt 
this acquisition expanded our federal and state local segments and added beneficial customer relationships to our commercial segment business 
we acquired scb so that a combined ciber and scb would be able to compete more effectively for larger public sector contracts 
we believe the acquisition provided an opportunity to realize operational efficiencies in the form of lower combined selling  general and administrative costs  primarily by reducing scb s corporate administrative costs 
the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the closing date of the respective acquisition 
results of operations consolidated the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data  expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended december  consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets operating income interest and other expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment using the modified prospective transition method 
the adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in the recording of compensation expense for employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights in our financial statements 
such compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the options or rights on the date of grant 
on january   substantially all of our outstanding stock options were fully vested due to vesting accelerations that occurred prior to january   and as such  they have little impact on our share based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r during or in subsequent years 
the incremental share based compensation expense recognized due to the adoption of sfas no 
r for the year ended december   was approximately million  or approximately million  net of related taxes 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we exclude the costs of our share based compensation programs from segment operating income as these expenses are significantly impacted by external factors  including stock market volatility and other valuation assumptions 
share based compensation cost is recognized in either cost of consulting services or in selling  general and administrative expenses  as appropriate  and is included as part of our corporate expenses

the revenue improvements in our state local and package segments of each were entirely attributable to organic growth 
the european revenues were up  including the positive impact from the two small acquisitions during  which contributed approximately million in incremental revenue  as well as an additional million in revenue from positive exchange rate fluctuations 
without those items  the european segment had a organic growth rate for the current year 
additionally  our commercial segment results were relatively flat between the comparable years  however  the organic growth rate in that segment was for after adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures 
all of these segment revenue increases combined to more than offset the revenue decline in our federal segment  which resulted primarily from the loss of a sizeable outsourcing contract  the effects of which were felt beginning in the second half of our average number of billable consultants working during the year increased to  in from  in our average billing rate increased to per hour in  compared to per hour in higher billing rates in our commercial segment  which divested its low billing rate ibm staffing business and continued to migrate toward a project solution based business model  accounted for the majority of the increase 
our european and state local segments also contributed to the higher average billing rate 
consultant utilization was in  compared to in other revenue increased to million in from million in  due to comparatively strong product sales in our state local segment  as well as heavy demand in our package segment 
in total  our gross profit percentage decreased basis points to of revenue in from of revenue in  primarily due to lower consulting services margins in our federal and package segments  which were offset by materially better margins in our commercial and state local segments 
the decreased services margin in our federal segment was due to higher margin revenue recognized in on an outsourcing contract that was re bid and lost in the middle of the package segment struggled with higher labor costs  continued reliance on higher priced subcontractors  plus unexpected cost overruns associated with projects that were completed during  all of which significantly impacted its gross services margins in gross profit percentage on other revenue improved basis points in to from in  due in part to higher commission percentages earned on increased sales volume in our technology solutions practice within our package segment 
improved margins in our european segment  associated with the sale of propriety software products  as well as the re sale of third party software products  also contributed to the other revenue margin increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a increased basis points to in from in the sg a percentage increase is largely a function of business mix 
our european segment  which has expected higher sg a costs and higher gross profit  accounted for a higher percentage of revenue in  compared to  and accounted for almost half of the increase in sg a dollars spent during the year 
excluding europe  sg a as a percentage of revenue increased slightly as we continued to invest in our offshore operation and our national practices  and as we began expensing stock options 
interest income and expense fluctuate based on our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed 
net interest expense totaled approximately million in  compared to million in in addition to our outstanding debentures  our average line of credit balance was approximately million during  compared to million during interest income is primarily from cash held in our european subsidiaries 
other income  net was  in  compared to other expense  net of  in other income in consisted mainly of foreign currency gains of  and additional proceeds from the sale of our ibm staffing operation of  offset by losses on foreign currency forward contracts of  and minority interest expense of  other expense in was primarily comprised of a million gain on the sale of our ibm staffing operation and gains on foreign currency forward contracts of  offset by foreign currency losses of million and minority interest expense of our effective tax rate was in  compared to in our effective tax rates in both and were favorably impacted by a federal research credit 
additionally  the tax rate reflects the multi year benefit from amending certain prior years tax returns because of additional allowable deductions identified 
the lower rate in was due to an adjustment to the expected benefit of the research credit related to prior years activities 
year ended december   as compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in the revenue growth primarily resulted from our acquisitions of scb  ascent and novasoft along with the acquisition of a small  single office sap practice  and was offset by the august sale of the staffing component of our ibm operation 
collectively  these acquisitions  offset by the divestiture of our ibm staffing operation  added approximately million in incremental revenue to  compared to excluding the revenue associated with the and acquisitions and divestiture from both periods  revenue would have increased by approximately  compared to revenue in was positively impacted by organic revenue growth in all five of our reporting segments  ranging from approximately in our commercial segment to approximately in our package segment 
our average number of billable consultants working during the year increased to approximately  in from approximately  in other revenue increased to million in from million in  due to our acquisition of ascent and sales of their proprietary software product 
the ascent increase was partially offset by an approximate million decrease in domestic hardware and software sales  due in part to a decrease in sales to a large state local segment client 
our average billing rate increased to per hour in  compared to per hour in higher billing rates in our european segment  now a larger percentage of the overall revenue total  plus higher billing rates in our commercial segment  accounted for the majority of the increase 
consultant utilization was in  compared to in in total  our gross profit percentage decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in the overall decline represents a mix of higher margins on other revenue  which improved by basis points  combined with a decline in services margins  which fell by basis points 
the other revenue margin improvement is primarily due to a full year of high margin product sales from our ascent acquisition  combined with improved margins within the technology solutions practice in our package segment 
the basis point year over year services margin decline is attributed primarily to execution issues in our european and state local segments 
in our european segment  cost overruns on two fixed price danish projects  along with poor performance in the first half of the year in one of our uk offices accounted for approximately basis points in overall services margin decline 
in our state local segment  project cost overruns and a fourth quarter project cancellation and project delay negatively impacted overall services gross margins by approximately basis points 
positively impacting services gross margins in was the full year benefit of ascent and novasoft  which combined  incrementally contributed approximately million of services revenue 
this incremental revenue yielded a gross margin of approximately  positively impacting ciber s overall services gross margin by approximately basis points 
the balance of the services gross profit percentage decline  about basis points  was the result of higher labor costs in our commercial and state local segments  and investments in our onshore and offshore cibersites locations 
sg a increased to million in from million in  primarily due to our acquisitions 
as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to in from in the increase is due primarily to expected higher sg a costs in our european segment  now a larger percentage of our overall business due to our acquisitions of ascent and novasoft 
excluding europe  sg a as a percentage of revenue actually decreased by approximately basis points 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from million in  due to additional amortizable intangible assets  primarily customer relationships  resulting from our recent acquisitions 
interest income and expense fluctuate based on our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed 
in addition to our outstanding debentures  our average line of credit balance was approximately million during  compared to million during interest income is primarily from cash held in our european subsidiaries 
net interest expense totaled approximately million in  compared to million in the prior year

absent the sale  and taking into account our july acquisition in india and the dissolution of our offshore joint venture  organic growth was approximately during and during current year organic growth was achieved mainly because of a healthy demand environment 
the increase in the average billing rate between and  due mainly to the absence of the ibm staffing business  which carried a lower average billing rate  was offset by lower utilization resulting from a higher percentage of project based business 
other revenue for our commercial segment represents the resale of third party hardware and software products 
the gross profit percentage on commercial segment services revenue increased by basis points to in  compared to in  and was due to a continued shift toward higher margin solution business  reflected by an increase in average billing rates 
gross profit percentage on services revenue decreased by basis points in  compared to  due to higher employee wage and benefit costs  combined with an increased reliance on higher cost subcontractors 
our gross profit percentage on other revenue increased by basis points in  compared to  which was due to the mix of products sold and our focus on the sale of higher margin products 
the commercial segment s increase in gross profit percentage was more than offset by higher sg a costs  resulting in a basis point operating income percentage decline to in  compared to in costs associated with the investment in our offshore operations  our national practices  and in cibersites  are all captured in this segment and account for the majority of the increase in sg a expenses

the term of the outsourcing contract ended  and it was required by the federal agency for which the work was being performed that the contract be re bid 
ciber and the prime vendor with whom we partnered were unsuccessful in our effort to continue providing services under the contract 
loss of this contract resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately million in the second half of and approximately million during our acquisition of scb in march of contributed to the revenue increase in  compared to  adding incremental revenue of approximately million in excluding the impact of the scb acquisition  federal revenue grew organically by approximately in  compared to  despite the lost outsourcing contract mentioned above

excluding the impact of that acquisition  total revenue for increased on an organic basis by approximately  compared to consulting services revenue for grew organically by approximately  while other revenue fell by over 
the organic growth in services revenue was attributed to growth in our security practice  as well as our ability to leverage our expertise in certain state local verticals

the consulting services gross profit percentage in our state local segment decreased in to from in several factors were responsible first  the company put a heavy dependence on high priced subcontractors  particularly for the work associated with the hurricane katrina relief efforts in new orleans  second  we experienced lower average billing rates and lower utilization elsewhere in the segment  and third  we experienced a project cost overrun and a fourth quarter project cancellation and delay that negatively impacted our service growth profit percentage by approximately basis points

other revenue is derived from our technology solutions practice and represents commissions earned on the resale of third party it hardware products 
other revenue increased in by approximately  compared to heavy demand for high end servers  along with computer hardware sold in conjunction with customer enterprise package software implementations  accounted for much of the increase 
package segment revenue in increased by approximately  compared to the increase was due to organic growth of approximately  resulting from continued improved demand following the completion of the acquisition of peoplesoft by oracle 
the market for peoplesoft implementation services was hindered in due to the uncertainty around oracle corporation s bid to acquire peoplesoft 
firms that had purchased peoplesoft software licenses were reluctant to engage firms like ciber to implement that software until there was clarity around the outcome of oracle s takeover attempt 
in addition to organic growth in the package segment  revenues also benefited from our first quarter acquisition of a single office operation specializing in sap implementations 
this acquisition closed at the beginning of january and contributed revenue of approximately million in in  other revenue increased by approximately to million  compared to million in heavy fourth quarter demand for it hardware sold to customers for their enterprise package software implementations along with successful cross selling efforts accounted for much of the increase

private  fluctuations in the level of it product sales and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
many of the individual reasons are outside of our control  and  as a result  it is normal for our dso to fluctuate from period to period  affecting our liquidity 
at december   we had approximately million of outstanding accounts receivable from the city of new orleans the city 
the city continues to experience administrative complications and fema reimbursement delays  which have delayed payment for our services 
however  we collected approximately million from the city in the second half of  and we continue to work diligently with the city and fema on a process that will improve collections going forward 
based on our communications with the city  we continue to expect to collect the balance in full 
accrued compensation and related liabilities were comparable at million at december   and million at december  these balances are subject to the effects from the timing of our normal bi weekly us payroll cycle 
at both december  and  there were days of unpaid wages 
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities typically fluctuate based on when we receive actual vendor invoices and when they are paid 
the largest of such items typically relates to vendor payments for it hardware and software products that we re sell and payments to services related contractors 
investing activities are primarily comprised of cash paid for acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment 
cash used for acquisitions was relatively flat in and with a total of million and million used in and  respectively 
in  however  we used million mainly for the acquisitions of scb  ascent and novasoft 
spending on property and equipment was fairly flat at million in  compared to million in we expect this level of spending on capital expenditures to continue through our financing activity outflows primarily consist of cash used for the repayment of our line of credit and term loans and the purchase of treasury stock 
in  we had an additional outflow of million related to the settlement of a cross currency interest rate swap 
in  we also used our cash to repay million of debt acquired in connection with our scb and ascent acquisitions 
inflows consist of cash provided by borrowings on our line of credit and term loans  sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee stock options 
at december   we had authorization for the repurchase of an additional million of common stock or debentures under our current repurchase plan 
we may continue to use cash to repurchase our common stock or our debentures  whichever is more advantageous 
convertible senior subordinated debentures in a private placement on december   we issued million of convertible senior subordinated debentures due to mature in december the debentures are general unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustments  prior to the close of business on the final maturity date only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after december   if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business days after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of debentures for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the debentures  if the debentures have been called for redemption  or upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate transactions 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
on january   ciber made an irrevocable election to settle in cash and not in shares  not less than of the principal amount of the debentures surrendered for conversion 
on july   we increased our irrevocable election to settle in cash and not in shares of the principal amount of the debentures surrendered for conversion 
as a result  upon conversion we will deliver cash in lieu of our common stock 
debenture holders may require us to repurchase their debentures on december    and  or at any time prior to their maturity in the case of certain events  at a repurchase price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
from december   to  but not including december   we may redeem any of the debentures if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in any consecutive trading day period 
beginning december   we may  by providing at least days notice to the holders  redeem any of the debentures at a redemption price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
given our current stock price and interest rates  we would expect that a large portion of the debentures could be required to be settled in cash in december we believe that our expected cash balance  plus other financing alternatives that we anticipate will be available to us at that time  will provide sufficient available resources to cover the payment of any debentures that we will have to settle in december bank line of credit we have a million revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  na that expires on september  as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
the line of credit will remain unsecured  unless borrowings exceed million for two consecutive fiscal quarters  or if certain financial covenant thresholds are exceeded  in which case  substantially all of ciber s assets would secure the line of credit 
the interest rate charged on borrowings under the agreement ranges from the prime rate of interest less to prime less  depending on ciber s pricing ratio and changes  as required  on the first day of each quarter 
ciber s pricing ratio is defined as the ratio of ciber s senior funded indebtedness at the end of each quarter divided by ciber s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters then ended 
on december   the bank s prime rate was and our rate for borrowing was 
we are also required to pay a fee per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit 
this fee ranges from to  depending on ciber s pricing ratio and changes  as required  on the first day of each quarter 
the terms of the credit agreement contain  among other provisions  specific limitations on additional indebtedness  liens and merger activity and prohibit the payment of any dividends 
the line of credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum asset coverage ratio senior funded indebtedness  excluding amounts due to ibm credit under the wholesale financing agreement  divided by net accounts receivable  excluding foreign accounts and accounts securing our wholesale finance agreement with ibm credit of  a maximum leverage ratio a ratio of total funded indebtedness divided by ebitda of to  a maximum senior leverage ratio the ratio of senior funded indebtedness divided by ebitda of to  and a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio the ratio of ebitdar to total fixed charges of to we are required to satisfy the financial covenants at the end of each quarter 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  certain elements of these ratios are defined below 
senior funded indebtedness includes borrowings under our line of credit and our term loans with wells fargo  plus the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit and any liabilities under our wholesale financing agreement with ibm credit 
it does not include our debentures or any liabilities under any swap contract 
total funded indebtedness includes all senior funded indebtedness plus all subordinated indebtedness 
this includes our debentures  but does not include any liabilities under any swap contract 
ebitda represents net income from continuing operations plus interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense and amortization expense  measured over the prior four quarters 
ebitdar represents net income plus interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense and rent payments  measured over the prior four quarters 
total fixed charges represents the sum of capital expenditures  plus interest expense and rent payments  measured over the prior four quarters 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total our debentures of million are due  and we presently pay approximately million annually in interest related to the debentures 
however  pursuant to their terms  they may be redeemed for cash at various times prior to maturity beginning in since we cannot predict any such redemption of the debentures and resulting changes to our interest payments  only their full principle value is reflected in the table above based upon their scheduled maturity date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 
we believe the future interest obligation on our line of credit is not estimable  primarily because the balance is not predictable and because the interest rate is a variable rate determined quarterly  and we have therefore not included any interest on our line of credit in the table above 
however  assuming neither the balance nor the rate changes in  we would pay less than  for interest expense in related to our line of credit 
includes operating leases for all office locations and office equipment 
seasonality we experience a moderate amount of seasonality 
our consulting revenue and profitability are affected by the number of workdays in a quarter 
typically  our billable hours are reduced in the second half of the year  especially during the fourth quarter  due to the large number of holidays and vacation time taken by our billable consultants 
as a result  our operating income as a percentage of revenue is generally the lowest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
recently issued accounting standard in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin no 
requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we will be required to adopt the provisions of fin no 
on january   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of fin no 
to determine its impact on our financial statements  but presently we anticipate that its adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience 
we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based on information available to us at the time they are made 
to the extent there are differences between our estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
such differences may be material to our financial statements 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are described below 
revenue recognition ciber primarily earns revenue from providing it services to its clients  and to a much lesser extent  from the sale and resale of it hardware and software products 
ciber s consulting services revenue comes from three primary sources technology integration services where we design  build and implement new or enhanced system applications and related processes  general it consulting services  such as system selection or assessment  feasibility studies  training and staffing  and managed it services in which we manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and or systems provided to our customers 
contracts for these services have different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  which require management to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenue 
fees for these contracts may be in the form of time and materials  cost plus or fixed price 
the majority of our consulting services revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
consulting services revenue also includes project related reimbursable expenses separately billed to clients 
revenue for technology integration consulting services where we design redesign  build and implement new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for our clients is generally recognized based on the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the percentage of completion based upon the contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs 
if the total cost estimate exceeds revenue  we accrue for the estimated loss immediately 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and anticipated changes in estimated costs 
estimates of total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract  and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income  and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
revenue for general it consulting services is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees based on time and materials or cost plus  we recognize revenue over the period of performance 
for fixed price contracts  depending on the specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverables  revenue may be recognized on a proportional performance model based on level of effort  as milestones are achieved  or when final deliverables have been provided 
managed it services arrangements typically span several years 
revenue from managed services time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from unit priced contracts is recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized on a straight line basis  unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs related to delivering managed services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of labor and other costs related to the set up of processes  personnel and systems  which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period services are provided 
amounts billable to the client for transition or set up activities are also deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period that the managed services are provided 
revenue for contracts with multiple elements is accounted for pursuant to emerging issues task force issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables or sop  software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on arrangements with multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting only if certain criteria are met 
if such criteria are not met  then combined accounting is applied to all deliverables  whereby  all revenue is recognized based on the accounting applicable to the last element to be delivered 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software  as well as commissions on sales of it products 
some software sales arrangements also include implementation services and or post contract customer support 
in such multi element arrangements  if the criteria are met  revenue is recognized based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element 
software support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
revenue related to the sale of it products is generally recognized when the products are shipped or  if applicable  when delivered and installed  in accordance with the terms of the sale 
where we are the re marketer of certain it products  commission revenue is recognized when the products are drop shipped from the vendor to the customer 
our commission revenue represents the sales price to the customer less the cost paid to the vendor 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services performed in advance of billings in accordance with contract terms 
under our typical time and materials billing arrangement  we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  we accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are generally billed the following month 
unbilled accounts receivable also arise when percentage of completion accounting is used and costs plus estimated contract earnings exceed billings 
such amounts are billed at specific milestone dates or at contract completion 
management expects all unbilled accounts receivable to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and are primarily comprised of deferred software support revenue 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is subject to impairment testing 
we review goodwill for impairment annually at june  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed during the second quarter of  did not result in an impairment charge 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
as a global company  we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction  as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 
we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect our overall effective tax rate 
we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities  and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes plus interest and possible penalties 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe certain positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed in realizing the entire tax benefit 
we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable 
however  final determinations of prior year tax liabilities  either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations  could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions 
the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 
no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
at december   we had gross accounts receivable of million  and our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of probable losses 
we review our accounts receivable and reassess our estimates of collectibility each month 
historically  our bad debt expense has been a very small percentage of our total revenue  as most of our revenues are from large credit worthy fortune companies and governments 
if our clients financial condition or liquidity were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
at december   we had approximately million of outstanding accounts receivable from the city of new orleans  a large portion of which is past due 
the city continues to experience administrative complications and fema reimbursement delays  which have delayed payment for our services 
however  we collected approximately million from the city in the second half of  and we continue to work diligently with the city and fema on a process that will improve collections going forward 
we continue to provide services to the city 
based on our communications with the city  we continue to expect to collect all amounts in full 
therefore  we have not provided for any reserves at december   related to this balance 
we cannot be assured that we will be successful in our collection efforts 
should the city s financial condition deteriorate  or should other information arise in the future to indicate that we may not be paid in full  we would have to provide for an appropriate reserve at such time 
accrued compensation and certain other accrued liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have several different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary  while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after our results are reported 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
we also estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience  and actual amounts may vary 
in the ordinary course of business  we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we periodically review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
we use significant judgment in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we expense legal fees as incurred 
other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill  if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired business 
other intangible assets primarily include  among other things  customer related assets such as order backlog  customer contracts and customer relationships 
determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions and estimates 
we often use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
in addition  these intangible assets are amortized over our best estimate of their useful life 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
during  approximately of our total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily arises from short term inter company transactions with our foreign subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made by our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time  we may enter into cross currency swap arrangements to partially hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our net investment in certain foreign operations 
at december   we had two outstanding cross currency swaps 
the first swap is for euros and united states dollars usd  has notional amounts of million million and matures in september a change in the value of the us dollar against the euro would result in approximately a million change in the value of our hedge instrument 
during the term of the cross currency swap  we will also remit to and receive from the counterparty interest payments equal to three month euribor plus and three month libor rates  respectively 
at december   we pay interest at a rate of and receive interest at a rate of on the notional amounts  and such rates are reset quarterly 
the second swap is for great british pounds gbp and usd  has notional amounts of million million and matures in september a change in the value of the us dollar against the gbp would result in approximately a million change in the value of our hedge instrument 
during the term of the cross currency swap  we will remit to and receive from the counterparty interest payments equal to two month gbp libor plus and two month libor rates  respectively 
at december   we pay interest at a rate of and receive interest at a rate of on the notional amounts  and such rates are reset quarterly 
the interest payments received will be recorded as a reduction of our reported interest expense and therefore  changes in the related interest rates will impact our net interest expense 
the combined fair value of these swaps at december   was approximately  we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts  to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
these foreign currency exposures typically arise from inter company transactions  such as loans  between foreign entities and or ciber  inc these derivative financial instruments generally have maturities of less than one year and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  as well as credit risk 
we have an outstanding euro gbp foreign currency forward contract at december   with notional amounts of million million 
a change in the value of the gbp against the euro would result in approximately a million change in the value of our hedge instrument 
this contract matures in march  and had a fair value of approximately  at december  we manage credit risk related to our cross currency swap and our foreign exchange forward contracts through careful selection of the financial institution utilized as the counterparty 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness under our bank line of credit has a variable interest rate 
at december   our outstanding borrowings under our line of credit were million and our interest rate was 
our million debentures carry a fixed rate of interest of 
however  we may be required to repurchase some or all of the debentures as early as december  depending upon  among other things  the interest rate environment and the price of our stock at that time 
if  during the months preceding december  interest rates are significantly higher than today s levels or the price of our stock is significantly lower than the debenture conversion price of  it is likely that we will incur a cost to satisfy our repurchase obligation 
that cost may be due to incremental interest expense  transaction fees  a lower debenture conversion price or some other form
