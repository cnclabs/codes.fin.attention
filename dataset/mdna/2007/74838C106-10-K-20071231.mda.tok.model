above 
overview we began operations in as a california company making boardshorts for surfers in the united states under a license agreement with the quiksilver brand founders in australia 
our product offerings expanded in the s as we grew our distribution channels 
after going public in and purchasing the rights to the quiksilver brand in the united states from our australian licensor  we further expanded our product offerings and began to diversify 
in  we acquired the european licensee of quiksilver and introduced roxy  our surf brand for teenage girls 
we also expanded in the s by adding products for boys  girls  toddlers and men and we introduced our proprietary retail store concept  boardriders clubs  which displays the heritage and products of quiksilver and roxy 
in  we acquired the international quiksilver and roxy trademarks  and in  we acquired our licensees in australia and japan 
in may  we acquired dc shoes  inc to expand our presence in action sports inspired footwear 
in july  we acquired skis rossignol  sa  a wintersports and golf equipment manufacturer 
rossignol offers a full range of wintersports equipment under the rossignol  dynastar  lange  look and kerma brands 
the acquisition was effective july  and we included the operations of rossignol in our results beginning on august  brand building has been a key to our growth  and we have always maintained our roots in the boardriding lifestyle 
today our products are sold throughout the world  primarily in surf shops  snow shops  skate shops and specialty stores 
over the past years  quiksilver has been established as a leading global brand representing the casual  youth lifestyle associated with boardriding sports 
with our acquisition of rossignol  we added a collection of leading ski equipment brands to our company that we believe can be the foundation for a full range of technical ski apparel  sportswear and accessories 
in october  we entered into an agreement to sell our golf equipment business for a transaction value of million 
this transaction was completed in december as a result of this disposition  the following financial information has been adjusted to exclude our golf equipment operations 
the golf equipment business has also been classified as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 

table of contents over the last five years  our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to billion in fiscal we operate in the outdoor market of the sporting goods industry in which we design  produce and distribute branded apparel  wintersports equipment  footwear  accessories and related products 
we operate in three segments  the americas  europe and asia pacific 
the americas segment includes revenues primarily from the us and canada 
the european segment includes revenues primarily from western europe 
the asia pacific segment includes revenues primarily from australia  japan  new zealand and indonesia 
royalties earned from various licensees in other international territories are categorized in corporate operations along with revenues from sourcing services for our licensees 
revenues by segment are as follows years ended october  in thousands americas europe asia pacific corporate operations total revenues  net we operate in markets that are highly competitive  and our ability to evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes is critical to our success 
if we are unable to remain competitive and maintain our consumer loyalty  our business will be negatively affected 
we believe that our historical success is due to the development of an experienced team of designers  artists  sponsored athletes  engineers  technicians  researchers  merchandisers  pattern makers  and contractors 
our team and the heritage and current strength of our brands has helped us remain competitive in our markets 
our success in the future will depend on our ability to continue to design products that are desirable in the marketplace and competitive in the areas of quality  brand image  technical specifications  distribution methods  price  customer service  and intellectual property protection

fiscal compared to fiscal revenues our total net revenues increased in fiscal to  million from  million in fiscal primarily as a result of increased unit sales 
revenues in the americas increased  european revenues increased  and asia pacific revenues increased 
to understand our european fiscal growth and better assess competitive performance  we believe it is important to consider revenues in euros as well  which is our functional currency in europe 
in euros  revenues decreased in fiscal 
table of contents this is lower than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth less in euros on average in fiscal compared to fiscal for consolidated financial statement reporting  australian dollar results must be translated into us dollar amounts at average exchange rates  but as with our european segment  this can distort performance when exchange rates change from year to year 
in australian dollars  revenues decreased in fiscal this is lower than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth less in australian dollars on average in fiscal compared to fiscal our net revenues can be categorized into two general classifications apparel brands and equipment brands 
our apparel brand revenue classification includes quiksilver  roxy  dc and our other apparel brands of hawk  gotcha  raisins  leilani and radio fiji 
our equipment brand revenue classification includes our rossignol and other wintersports brands  comprising rossignol  dynastar  look  lange  kerma  lib technologies  gnu and bent metal 
our apparel brand revenues increased to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal this increase resulted from strength in our dc  quiksilver and roxy brands 
dc s growth was primarily in footwear and  to a lesser extent  its apparel and accessories products 
quiksilver and roxy brand revenue growth came primarily from growth in apparel and  to a lesser extent  accessories and footwear products 
our wintersports equipment brand revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease in revenues was a result of decreased market demand caused by unseasonably warm weather and a lack of snowfall in many parts of europe and the united states in the winter season 
the season also had a negative impact on the beginning of the snow season as preorders were down significantly from the prior year and less reorders are expected on the smaller base of preorders

the gross profit margin in the americas increased to from  our european gross profit margin increased to from  and our asia pacific gross profit margin increased to from 
the increase in the americas gross profit margin was primarily due to lower production costs and a higher percentage of sales through company owned retail stores where higher gross margins are generated 
our european and asia pacific gross profit margin increases were primarily due to higher margins from our apparel brands  primarily as a result of the currency effect of sourcing goods in us dollars  partially offset by lower margins on our equipment brands 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal in the americas  these expenses increased to million from million  in europe they increased to million from million  and in asia pacific they increased to million from million for those same periods

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense increased to of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was primarily caused by the cost of opening and operating additional retail stores  increased distribution costs and  to a lesser extent  costs recorded in continuing operations as a result of our termination of a consulting agreement with the former minority shareholder of cleveland golf 
asset impairments asset impairment charges totaled million in fiscal compared to zero in fiscal of these charges approximately related to rossignol related goodwill  approximately million related to trademark impairment and approximately million related to fixed asset impairments 
the goodwill and intangible impairment charges were recorded as a result of our annual impairment test  where it was determined that the carrying values of certain rossignol related asset groups were less than the estimated fair value of those same groups as of october  non operating expenses interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of the translation effect of euro denominated interest  higher borrowing levels on our lines of credit to finance increased working capital needs and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates on our variable rate debt in europe and the united states 
our foreign currency loss amounted to million in fiscal compared to approximately zero in fiscal this current year loss resulted primarily from the foreign currency contracts that we used to mitigate the risk of translating the results of our international subsidiaries into us dollars and the foreign exchange effect of certain non us dollar denominated liabilities 
our income tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the current year rate increased significantly due to the non deductibility of the goodwill asset impairment recorded in fiscal this increase was partially offset by the higher impact of certain beneficial items included in our tax rate

the gross profit margin in the americas increased to from  our european gross profit margin increased to from  and our asia pacific gross profit margin decreased to from 
the increase in the americas gross profit margin was primarily due to lower production costs  improved margins in our dc brand  and a higher percentage of sales through company owned retail stores where higher gross margins are generated  partially offset by higher sales from our wintersports equipment business  which operated at lower margins than our other businesses 
our european gross profit margin increased slightly due to a higher percentage of sales through company owned retail stores 
this increase was substantially offset by the impact of the lower margins from our rossignol business 
in asia pacific  the gross profit margin decrease was primarily due to sales from our lower margin wintersports equipment business and lower margins on our other brands  partially offset by a higher percentage of sales through company owned retail stores

non operating expenses interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of debt incurred and assumed in connection with the acquisition of rossignol 
we had no foreign currency gain in fiscal compared to a foreign currency gain of million in fiscal this current year change resulted primarily from the net effect of foreign currency contracts that we used to mitigate the risk of translating the results of our international subsidiaries into us dollars 

table of contents our income tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily because a higher percentage of our fiscal profits were generated in countries with lower tax rates and from foreign tax credits

multiple banks in the united states  europe and australia make these lines of credit available to us

cash and cash equivalents totaled million at october  versus million at october  working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october   an increase of 
we believe that our current cash balance  operating cash flows and current lines of credit are adequate to cover our cash needs for at least the next twelve months and that increases in our lines of credit can be obtained as needed to fund future growth 
we have generated further liquidity of approximately million from the sale of our golf equipment operations in december operating cash flows operating activities of continuing operations provided cash of million in fiscal compared to cash used of million in fiscal this improvement primarily relates to a decrease in cash used for inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable of million 
operating activities of continuing operations used cash of million in fiscal compared to cash provided of million in fiscal this million increase in cash used was primarily caused by an increase in inventories  net of accounts payable  which used cash of million in fiscal compared to providing cash of million in fiscal  and an increase in cash used for other working capital components  which used cash of million in fiscal compared to cash provided of million in fiscal these increases in cash used were partially offset by an increase in cash profits  which provided million of cash in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and a decrease in cash used for accounts receivable growth  which used million in cash in the current year compared to million in fiscal capital expenditures we have historically avoided high levels of capital expenditures for our apparel manufacturing functions by using independent contractors for sewing and other processes such as washing  dyeing and embroidery 
we perform the cutting process in house for certain product categories in the americas to enhance control and efficiency  and we screenprint a portion of our product in house in both the americas and in europe 
in our equipment business where we own and operate manufacturing facilities  our capital expenditures are higher

as of october   we have paid approximately million related to these integration activities 
if we have overestimated our integration costs  the excess will reduce goodwill in future periods 
conversely  if we have underestimated these costs  additional liabilities recognized will be recorded in earnings

certain facilities owned by rossignol are expected to be sold in connection with the plan  while others are anticipated to be refinanced through sale leaseback arrangements

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
none of our sales agreements with any of our customers provide for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brands and our image 
we provide allowances for estimated returns when revenues are recorded  and related losses have historically been within our expectations 
if returns are higher than our estimates  our earnings would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable it is not uncommon for some of our customers to have financial difficulties from time to time 
this is normal given the wide variety of our account base  which includes small surf and ski shops  medium sized retail chains  and some large department store chains 
throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain a reserve for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
we also maintain credit insurance for a majority of our european wintersports equipment receivables that protects against the risk of customer default 
historically  our losses have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties of our customers could have an adverse impact on our profits 
inventories we value inventories at the cost to purchase and or manufacture the product or the current estimated market value of the inventory  whichever is lower 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand  and adjust inventory values for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
demand for our products could fluctuate significantly 
the demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors  including the following weakening economic conditions  terrorist acts or threats  unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  reduced customer confidence in the retail market  and unseasonable weather 

table of contents some of these factors could also interrupt the production and or importation of our products or otherwise increase the cost of our products 
as a result  our operations and financial performance could be negatively affected 
additionally  our estimates of product demand and or market value could be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
long lived assets we acquire tangible and intangible assets in the normal course of our business 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these long lived assets including fixed assets  trademarks licenses and other amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
we continually use judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
the reasonableness of our judgment could significantly affect the carrying value of our long lived assets 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is computed based on estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change  and we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down would  in our judgment  be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
stock based compensation expense effective november   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments granted after november  and prior to but not yet vested as of november   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest using the graded vested method over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for stock based payments under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and accordingly  we were not required to recognize compensation expense for options granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value compensation expense 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 

table of contents foreign currency translation a significant portion of our revenues are generated in europe  where we operate with the euro as our functional currency  and a smaller portion of our revenues are generated in asia pacific  where we operate with the australian dollar and japanese yen as our functional currencies 
our european revenues in the united kingdom are denominated in british pounds  and substantial portions of our european and asia pacific product is sourced in us dollars  both of which result in exposure to gains and losses that could occur from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
as part of our overall strategy to manage our level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we enter into various foreign exchange contracts generally in the form of forward contracts 
for all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives in other comprehensive income 
we also use other derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting to mitigate our exposure to currency risks 
these derivatives are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks 
two of these risks are foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates that affect interest expense 
see also note of our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency and derivatives we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales  royalty income and product purchases of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from domestic transactions that are not denominated in us dollars  and to fluctuations in interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
furthermore  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting but are used by management to mitigate exposure to currency risks are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
a loss of million was recognized related to these types of contracts during fiscal for all qualifying cash flow hedges  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income 
as of october   we were hedging forecasted transactions expected to occur through october assuming exchange rates at october  remain constant  million of losses  net of tax  related to hedges of these transactions are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next months 
on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate certain of the derivatives as a hedge of the identified exposure 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge transactions 
we identify in this documentation the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and indicate how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
we formally measure effectiveness of our hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with our risk management policy 
we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur  because a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or if we determine that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
we enter into forward exchange and other derivative contracts with major banks and are exposed to foreign currency losses in the event of nonperformance by these banks 
we anticipate  however  that these banks will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
accordingly  we do not obtain collateral or other security to support the contracts 
translation of results of international subsidiaries as discussed above  we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of income of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and can distort comparisons from year to year 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans to hedge the profit and loss effects of such exposure  but accounting rules do not allow us to hedge the actual translation of sales and expenses 

table of contents by way of example  when the us dollar strengthens compared to the euro  there is a negative effect on our reported results for our european operating segment 
it takes more profits in euros to generate the same amount of profits in stronger us dollars 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the us dollar weakens there is a positive effect on our reported results from our european operating segment 
also  our us wintersports equipment business sources their production primarily in euros and transacts their sales in us dollars 
if the dollar weakens  there is a negative impact on the profitability of our us wintersports equipment business 
in fiscal  the us dollar weakened compared to the euro and the australian dollar 
as a result  our european revenues decreased in euros compared to an increase of in us dollars 
asia pacific revenues decreased in australian dollars compared to an increase of in us dollars 
interest rates most of our lines of credit and long term debt bear interest based on libor and euribor plus a credit spread 
effective interest rates  therefore  can move up or down depending on market conditions 
the credit spreads are subject to change based on financial performance and market conditions upon refinancing 
interest expense also includes financing fees and related costs and can be affected by foreign currency movement upon translating non us dollar denominated interest into dollars for reporting purposes 
the approximate amount of our remaining variable rate debt was million at october   and the average effective interest rate at that time was 
if interest rates or credit spreads were to increase by  our income before tax would be reduced by approximately million based on these fiscal levels
