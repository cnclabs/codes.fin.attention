item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a denver  colorado based independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration for  and the acquisition  development  production  and sale of  natural gas and crude oil 
our core areas of operation are the rocky mountain and gulf coast regions  which comprise the majority of our proved reserves  production and long term growth prospects 
we have a significant drilling inventory that consists of proved and unproved locations  the majority of which are located in our rocky mountain development projects 
at december   we had estimated proved reserves that totaled bcfe  of which were proved developed  with an after tax pv value of million 
as of december   we achieved net continuing production of mmcfe per day 
as of december   our reserves were comprised of approximately bcf of natural gas and mmbbls of crude oil  or gas on an equivalent basis 
approximately of our proved reserves were located in the gulf coast  in the rocky mountains  and in other locations 
we expect that our drilling efforts and capital expenditures will focus increasingly on the rockies  where approximately of our fiscal drilling budget is allocated and more than one half of our undeveloped acreage is located 
as of december   we controlled approximately  net undeveloped acres  representing approximately of our total acreage position 
we retain a high degree of operational control over our asset base  with an average working interest in excess of excluding crb properties as of december  this provides us with controlling interests in a multi year inventory of drilling locations  positioning us for continued reserve and production growth through our drilling operations 
we also have a controlling ownership interest in a drilling company  providing the benefit of access to drilling rigs primarily located in the rocky mountain region 
we concentrate our exploration and development efforts in fields where we can apply our technical exploration and development expertise  and where we have accumulated significant operational control and experience 
for calendar year  we have preliminarily established a drilling budget of approximately to million 
we are concentrating a substantial portion of this budget on the development of our paradox  piceance and wind river basin assets in the rockies  and to a lesser extent  our newton and midway loop fields in the gulf coast 
state of the art geologic and seismic geophysical modeling indicates that these fields have targeted geologic formations containing substantial hydrocarbon deposits that can be economically developed 
recently completed successful wells in several of our rocky mountain development programs 
table of contents have found multiple accumulations of tight sand reservoirs at various depths  characterized by low permeability and high pressure 
these types of reservoirs possess predictable geologic attributes and consistent reservoir characteristics  which typically result in a higher drilling success rate and lower per well cost and risk 
the exploration for and the acquisition  development  production  and sale of  natural gas and crude oil is highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the market price of the commodity produced and the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders 
generating reserve and production growth while containing costs represents an ongoing focus for management  and is made particularly important in our business by the natural production and reserve decline associated with oil and gas properties 
in addition to developing new reserves  we compete to acquire additional reserves  which involve judgments regarding recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities  title issues and other factors 
during periods of historically high oil and gas prices  third party contractor and material cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services 
other challenges we face include attracting and retaining qualified personnel  gaining access to equipment and supplies and maintaining access to capital on sufficiently favorable terms 
we have taken the following steps to mitigate the challenges we face 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging meaningful portions of our expected production through the use of derivatives  typically costless collars 
the level of our hedging activity and the duration of the instruments employed depend upon our review of market conditions  available hedge prices and our operating strategy 
our current derivative contracts cover approximately bcfe of our estimated oil and gas production 
our interest in a drilling and trucking company allows us to mitigate the increasing challenge for rig availability in the rocky mountains and also helps to control third party contractor and material costs 
our business strengths include a multi year inventory of attractive drilling locations and a diverse balance of high return gulf coast properties and long lived rockies reserves  which we believe will allow us to grow reserves and replace and expand production organically without having to rely solely on acquisitions 
recent developments during the year ended december   we achieved the following increased reserves to bcfe at december   an increase of or after considering current year sales and purchases  compared to reserves as of december  of bcfe 
during the fourth quarter of  three successful exploratory wells were drilled in the paradox basin establishing a new significant area for the company 
total reserve additions were bcfe and to million of the company s drilling budget has been allocated to the greentown and salt valley projects 
our total production for the year ended december  was bcfe 
adjusted for asset dispositions  our production from continuing operations increased to bcfe  compared to bcfe for the prior year period  primarily as a result of exploratory and developmental drilling during 
table of contents results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to items that have affected our results of operations for the years ended december  and  six months ended december  and  and the fiscal years ended june  and during  we changed our fiscal year end from june to december  effective december  accordingly  we have presented below for comparative purposes unaudited historical statements of operation for the year ended december  and six months ended december  the following table sets forth in thousands  for the periods presented  selected historical statements of operations data

net income decreased million to  or 
per diluted common share  for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million  or 
per diluted common share  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to an million increase in operating losses resulting from higher revenue and a million gain on the sale of oil and gas properties  offset by higher depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense  higher exploration  dry hole and abandonment costs  and increased general and administrative expenses 
oil and gas sales 
during the year ended december   oil and natural gas revenue from continuing operations increased to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of a increase in average daily production from continuing operations 
table of contents over the year ended december   an increase in average onshore oil price received in the year ended december  of per bbl compared to per bbl during the same period in  and an increase in offshore oil price received of per bbl during the year ended december  compared to during the year ended december   partially offset by a decrease in the average onshore gas price received during the year ended december  of per mcf compared to per mcf received in the year ended december  net realized losses from effective hedging activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in realized hedging losses is primarily due to higher oil prices 
these losses are recorded as a decrease in total revenues 
contract drilling and trucking fees 
at december  dhs owned drilling rigs with depth ratings of approximately  to  feet 
we have the right to use all of the rigs on a priority basis  although approximately three fourths are currently working for third party operators 
drilling revenues earned on wells drilled for delta have been eliminated through consolidation 
drilling revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the prior year period 
drilling revenue is earned under daywork contracts where we provide a drilling rig with required personnel to our third party customers  who supervise the drilling of the well 
we are paid based on a negotiated fixed rate per day while the rig is in use 
during the mobilization period we typically earn a fixed amount of revenue based on the mobilization rate set in the contract 
drilling revenues earned on wells drilled for delta have been eliminated through consolidation 
at december  there were dhs rigs in operation compared to rigs in operation at december  trucking revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to  for the prior year period 
trucking revenues were insignificant during the year ended december  as the acquisition of chapman trucking company was completed in november  production and cost information production volumes  average prices received and cost per equivalent mcf for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended december  onshore offshore onshore offshore production continuing operations oil mbbl gas mmcf production discontinued operations oil mbbl gas mmcf total production mmcfe average price continuing operations oil per barrel gas per mcf costs per mcfe continuing operations hedge effect lease operating expense production taxes transportation costs depreciation  depletion and amortization expense lease operating expense 
lease operating expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period a year earlier 
lease operating expense increased due to our increase in production and due to increased per unit costs 
lease operating expense from continuing operations for onshore properties for the year ended december  was per mcfe as compared to 
table of contents per mcfe for the same period a year earlier 
lease operating expense from continuing operations for offshore properties was per mcfe for the year ended december  and per mcfe for the same period a year earlier 
the increase in onshore per unit lease operating expenses is a result of generally rising field costs due to increased demand for services  and is also affected by overall infrastructure costs for some properties that were still experiencing limited production due to pipeline constraints 
depreciation  depletion and amortization oil and gas 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to million in the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses for our onshore properties increased to per mcfe during the year ended december  from per mcfe for the year ended december  the depletion rate increase is partially due to certain deep  multi stage completion projects in which the majority of our well costs are depleted over completed zones that have not met initial expectations 
also  during the year ended december   a million developmental dry hole in south angleton was added to the depletion pool 
depreciation and amortization drilling and trucking 
depreciation and amortization expense drilling and trucking increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year period 
this increase can be attributed to additional rigs acquired by dhs drilling company 
exploration expense 
exploration expense consists of geological and geophysical costs and lease rentals 
our exploration costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  current year activities include activities in our columbia river basin  washington  grand county  utah and newton county  texas projects 
during the year ended december   our most significant exploration cost was related to the million newton d seismic shoot covering square miles which was completed and processed during in addition  we acquired d data in the gulf coast region and also began acquiring geophysical data on the columbia river basin properties in the state of washington 
dry hole costs 
we incurred dry hole costs of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
during  a significant portion of these costs were related to dry holes that were drilled in utah and california 
for the year ended december   the dry hole costs related primarily to exploratory projects in texas and utah 
abandoned and impaired properties 
during the year ended december   an impairment of million was recorded on certain of the company s eastern colorado properties primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices 
in addition  an impairment of million was recorded on certain oklahoma properties that are held for sale at december  during  we are continuing to develop and evaluate certain properties on which favorable or unfavorable results or commodity prices may cause us to revise in future quarters our estimates of those properties future cash flows 
such revisions of estimates could require us to record an impairment in the period of such revisions 
during the year ended december   a dry hole was drilled on a prospect located in california 
based on drilling results and evaluation of the prospect  we determined that we would not pursue development and accordingly an impairment of million was recorded for the full impairment of the remaining leasehold costs related to the prospect 
drilling and trucking operations 
we had drilling and trucking operations expense of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the significant increase in expenses was due to an increase in the number of rigs in operation  rigs as of december  compared to eight rigs at december  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to an increase in non cash equity compensation of million  a increase in technical and administrative staff and related personnel costs  and the expansion of our office facility 
in addition  million of the increase is related to dhs general and administrative expense 
dhs general and administrative expense has increased with added headcount for dhs growth during the past year and a full year of operations in compared to nine months of operations in 
table of contents gain on sale of oil and gas properties 
during december  delta transferred its ownership in approximately  gross acres  net acres of non operated interests in the columbia river basin to crbp 
in january and march  delta sold a combined minority interest in crbp 
accordingly  the company recorded a million gain million  net of tax and a million reduction to property during the first quarter of as a result of the closing of the transaction 
as a result of the transaction  delta now owns a net interest of  acres in the columbia river basin through its remaining ownership of crbp and a direct interest in  net acres in the columbia river basin from previous transactions 
in november  the company sold certain undeveloped property interests in the columbia river basin for proceeds of million 
the company recorded a gain on the transaction of million 
in march  the company sold approximately of pgr 
this transaction involved both proved and unproved property interests and accordingly  to the extent the sale of pgr related to unproved properties  no gain could be recognized as all of the unproved cost basis was not yet recovered 
the company recorded a gain of million  million net of tax  and a million offset to property during the first quarter of as a result of the transaction 
the company retained a interest in  and is the manager of  pgr 
gain on sale of marketable security

gain on sale of investment in lng project 
on march   the company sold its long term minority interest investment in an lng project for total proceeds of million 
the company recorded a gain on sale of million  net of tax 
gain loss on ineffective derivative instruments  net 
during the year ended december   our gas derivative contracts became ineffective and no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
hedge ineffectiveness results from different changes in the nymex contract terms and the physical location  grade and quality of our oil and gas production 
the change in fair value of our nymex gas contracts is reflected in earnings  as opposed to being recorded in other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
as a result  we recognized an million gain and a million loss in our statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as commodity prices fluctuate  we will record our nymex gas derivative contracts at market value with any changes in market value recorded through unrealized gain loss on derivative contracts in our statement of operations 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the minority investors percentage of their share of income or losses from dhs in which they hold an interest 
during the years ended december  dhs generated a greater profit resulting in increased minority interest expense 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily related to the increase in the average amount outstanding under our credit facility  higher interest rates and the increased long term debt balance related to the dhs credit facility 
in addition  during  dhs incurred a pre payment penalty of  and wrote off deferred financing costs of  to pay off a term loan that was replaced with a lower interest rate term loan 
income tax benefit 
during the year ended december   an income tax benefit of million was recorded for continuing operations at an effective tax rate of compared to an income tax benefit of million and an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the rate was significantly affected by the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the company s deferred tax assets 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations include the deerlick creek field in tuscaloosa county  alabama  which was sold in september  the frisco field in pointe coupee parish  louisiana  which was sold in june  the panola and rusk county  texas properties  which were sold in august  the east texas and pennsylvania properties  which were sold in august  and the kansas field  which was sold in

extraordinary gain 
an extraordinary gain was recorded during the year as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas 
due to the excess fair value of the assets compared to the purchase price of the transaction and the company s intention to sell the oil and gas properties  delta recorded a million extraordinary gain  net of tax  during the year ended december  the oil and gas properties acquired from castle were in fact sold during august six months ended december  compared to six months ended december  unaudited net income 
net income decreased million to a net loss of  or 
per diluted common share for the six months ended december   as compared to net income of million or 
per diluted common share for the six months ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a million loss for ineffective hedges  million of realized losses on effective hedging contracts  higher exploration and dry hole costs  increased general and administrative expenses of million due to the growth in the company s operations and activities  and increased interest and financing costs of million due to higher average debt outstanding 
revenue 
during the six months ended december   oil and natural gas revenue from continuing operations increased to million  as compared to million for the six months ended december  the increase was the result of an average onshore gas price received during the six months ended december  of per mcf compared to per mcf received in the six months ended december   an increase in average onshore oil price received in the six months ended december  of per bbl compared to per bbl during the same period in  an increase in offshore oil price received of per bbl during the six months ended december  compared to during the six months ended december   and a increase in continuing average daily production over the six months ended december  cash payments required on our effective hedging activities impacted revenues during the six months ended december  and the cost of settling our effective hedging activities was million and  during the six months ended december  and  respectively 
contract drilling and trucking fees 
at december  dhs owned eleven drilling rigs with depth ratings of approximately  to  feet 
in early  two additional rigs were acquired 
we have the right to use all of the rigs on a priority basis  although approximately half were working for third party operators at december  drilling revenues for the six months ended december  increased to million compared to  for the prior year period 
drilling revenue is earned under daywork contracts where we provide a drilling rig with required personnel to our third party customers  who supervise the drilling of the well 
we are paid based on a negotiated fixed rate per day while the rig is in use 
during the mobilization period we typically earn a fixed amount of revenue based on the mobilization rate set in the contract 
drilling revenues earned on wells drilled for delta have been eliminated through consolidation 
at december  there were eight dhs rigs in operation compared to four rigs in operation at june  trucking revenues were insignificant during the six months ended december  as the chapman acquisition was completed in november

lease operating expense from continuing operations for offshore properties was per mcfe for the six months ended december  and per mcfe for the same period a year earlier 
this increase in lease operating costs from continuing operations per mcfe can be primarily attributed to the increase in the percentage of wells owned in the gulf coast region  largely due to the manti acquisition in january  as compared to our other regions 
our gulf coast properties typically have higher average lease operating costs 
newton also experienced substantial costs related to compression and salt water hauling and disposal 
depreciation  depletion and amortization oil and gas 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to million in the six months ended december   as compared to million for the six months ended december  depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses for our onshore properties increased to per mcfe during the six months ended december  from per mcfe for the six months ended december  depletion rates have increased based on the higher amounts paid to acquire reserves in the ground and the increase in drilling costs relative to reserve additions 
we also incurred higher depletion rates caused by lower proved developed producing reserves in our south angleton field from unsuccessful drilling results 
depreciation and amortization drilling and trucking 
depreciation and amortization expense drilling and trucking increased to million for the six months ended december  as compared to  for the prior year period 
this increase can be attributed to additional rigs acquired by dhs drilling company 
exploration expense 
exploration expense consists of geological and geophysical costs and lease rentals 
our exploration costs for the six months ended december  were million compared to million for the six months ended december  the increase in exploration costs was primarily related to seismic costs and impairment of prospect acquisition costs 
during the six months ended december   our most significant exploration cost related to the million newton d seismic shoot covering square miles which was completed and processed during and which will assist us in prioritizing our drilling locations and identifying new target formations in in addition  we acquired d data in the gulf coast region and also began acquiring geophysical data on the columbia river basin properties in the state of washington 

table of contents dry hole costs 
we incurred dry hole costs of approximately million for the six months ended december  compared to million for the same period a year ago

abandoned and impaired properties 
during the six months ended december   a dry hole was drilled on a prospect located in orange county  california 
based on drilling results and evaluation of the prospect  we determined that we would not pursue development and accordingly an impairment of million was recorded for the full impairment of the remaining leasehold costs related to the prospect 
drilling and trucking operations 
we had drilling and trucking operations of million during the six months ended december  compared to million during the six months ended december  the significant increase in expenses was due to an increase in the number of rigs in operation  eight rigs as of december  compared to two rigs at december  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the six months ended december  as compared to million for the six months ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to million of stock option compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no

our exploration costs for the year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior year 
fiscal activities include newly acquired seismic information in washington county  colorado  polk county  texas and laramie county  wyoming 
dry hole costs 
we incurred dry hole costs of approximately million for the year ended june  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
a significant portion of these costs relate to our trail blazer prospect in laramie county  wyoming 
included in the dry holes were four non niobrara formation dry holes in washington county  colorado

minority interest represents the minority investors percentage of their share of income or losses from big dog  shark or dhs in which they hold an interest 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily related to the million senior note offering completed in march and the increase in the average amount outstanding under our credit facility primarily as a result of the manti acquisition completed in january and our increased investment in the columbia river basin prospect in washington completed in april liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to access cash 
our cash requirements are largely dependent upon the number and timing of projects included in our capital development plan  most of which is discretionary 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity requirements through the issuance of debt and equity securities when market conditions permit  through cash provided by operating activities and sales of oil and gas properties  and through borrowings under our credit facility 
during the year ended december   we had an operating loss of million  generated cash from operating activities of million and obtained cash from financing activities of million 
during this year we spent million on oil and gas development or million  net of million proceeds from dispositions  million on oil and gas acquisitions  and million on drilling and trucking capital expenditures or million  net of million contributed by minority interest partners 
at december   we had million in cash  total assets of million and a debt to total capitalization ratio of 
long term debt at december  totaled million  comprised of million combined bank debt and million of senior subordinated notes 
in may  dhs closed a new million senior secured credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  of which million was initially drawn 
in june  the borrowing base on delta s credit facility was increased by million to million  and again increased to million in november also in december  we entered into an unsecured term loan with jp morgan chase bank  na for million which was subsequently repaid in january with proceeds from an equity offering 
available borrowing capacity under the delta bank credit facility at december  was approximately million  and million was available for dhs under its credit facility 
beginning with the quarter ending march   we are required to meet certain financial covenants which include a current ratio of to  net of derivative instruments  and a consolidated debt to ebitdax earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and exploration of less than to for the quarters ending march and june   to for the quarters ending september and december   and to for the end of each quarter thereafter 
these financial covenant calculations only reflect wholly owned subsidiaries 
we expect to meet our covenants at march  and for the remainder of the year 
although we expect to continue with development of our properties  a significant portion of our planned capital expenditures are discretionary and can be delayed or curtailed  if necessary  given adequate lead time 
if we do not meet our covenants in the future and we are unable to obtain a waiver from the banks  we would be in default of the terms of our credit facility  our long term debt would be reclassified to a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet and the outstanding principal balance could be called by the banks  thereby becoming immediately due and payable 
during the fourth quarter of  our credit facility was amended to contain covenant requirements that better match our development plans and operating strategy 
during  we have completed several equity  debt  and property transactions as described below 
on february   we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million  a portion of which were used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price in an acquisition of certain oil and gas property interests in central utah from armstrong resources  llc armstrong 
during the first quarter of  we sold minority interests in crbp and pgr for proceeds of million and million  respectively 
in april  the company closed its acquisition of castle energy corporation with the net issuance of million shares of common stock 
the company received approximately million in cash in connection with the castle acquisition 
in june  the company 
table of contents sold its frisco properties for proceeds of million 
in addition  during august  the company sold certain east texas properties and the pennsylvania properties acquired in the castle acquisition for proceeds of million and million  respectively 
our short term liquidity needs at december   were aided by certain cash generating transactions in the first quarter of in january  we sold non core properties in kansas which accounted for bcfe of proved reserves at december   for proceeds of million and in february  we executed a purchase and sale agreement to sell non core gulf coast and permian basin properties which accounted for bcfe of proved reserves at december   for net proceeds of million 
also  in january  we raised net proceeds of million through a public offering of  shares of common stock 
the prices we receive for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production have a significant impact on operating cash flows 
we are unable to predict with any degree of certainty the prices we will receive for our future oil and gas production and the success of our exploration and production activities in generating additions to production 
we believe that borrowings under our revolving credit facility  projected operating cash flows  proceeds from additional debt and equity financings and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet the requirements of our business  however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables  including the level of production and oil and natural gas prices 
we cannot give assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures or that increased capital expenditures will not be undertaken 
most of our capital expenditures are discretionary  and actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to a variety of factors  including but not limited to  drilling results  product pricing and future acquisitions and divestitures of properties 
although we believe we have access to adequate capital to fund our development plans  we continue to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including a restructured debt facility  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of preferred and common stock  the sales of non strategic assets  and joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  our ability to execute our operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
company acquisitions and growth we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and property development opportunities 
during the year ended december   we completed the following transactions on july   dhs purchased a national drilling rig rig for million 
the rig is a  horsepower rig with a depth rating of  feet 
the rig was placed into service in november and is currently under contract to a third party operator in wyoming 
in may  dhs acquired two rigs rig and rig in conjunction with the acquisition of c l drilling company  inc for a purchase price of approximately million 
the rigs are currently under contract to third party operators and working in california and utah 
on april   castle energy corporation shareholders approved the merger agreement between delta and castle energy corporation and subsidiaries collectively  castle 
as of that date  delta  through its subsidiary  dpca  acquired castle for a purchase price of million comprised of million net shares issued  shares issued net of  owned by castle valued at million and million of transaction costs 
delta obtained assets valued at million which were comprised of cash  producing oil and gas properties located in pennsylvania and west virginia  and certain other assets 
due to the excess fair value of the assets compared to the purchase price of the transaction and the company s intention to sell the oil and gas properties  delta recorded a million extraordinary gain  net of tax  during the year ended december  the oil and gas properties acquired from castle were in fact sold during august on february   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with armstrong to acquire a working interest in approximately  gross acres in the central utah hingeline play for a purchase price of million in cash and  shares of common stock

historical cash flow our cash flow from operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period a year earlier 
our net cash used in investing activities decreased by to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period a year earlier 
the decrease in cash used for investing activity can be attributed to a reduction in property acquisitions due to an increased focus on drilling activities 
cash flow from financing activities decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period the prior year 
during the year ended december   we financed our operations  acquisitions  and capital expenditures primarily with net proceeds of million in newly issued equity and million in net debt additions 
our cash flow from operating activities increased to million for the six months ended december  compared to million for the same period a year earlier  primarily as a result of a increase in revenue and a increase in non cash depletion expense 
our net cash used in investing activities increased by to million for the six months ended december  compared to million for the same period a year earlier 
the increase in cash used for investing activity can be attributed to the expansion of our drilling programs in both the rocky mountain and gulf coast regions along with additional drilling rig acquisitions 
cash flow from financing was million for the six months ended december  compared to for the same period the prior year

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas reserves  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes  derivatives  contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
successful efforts method of accounting we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for gas and oil leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially 
table of contents capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit of production amortization rate 
a gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze  and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver gas and oil in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
delineation seismic costs incurred to select development locations within an oil and gas field are typically considered a development cost and capitalized  but often these seismic programs extend beyond the reserve area considered proved and management must estimate the portion of the seismic costs to expense 
the evaluation of gas and oil leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when we are entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding a gas and oil field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
reserve estimates estimates of gas and oil reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas and oil reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future gas and oil prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover gas costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas and oil attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our gas and oil properties and or the rate of depletion of the gas and oil properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
impairment of gas and oil properties we review our oil and gas properties for impairment at least annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
we estimate the expected future cash flows of our developed proved properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the proved properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures and production costs  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 

table of contents given the complexities associated with gas and oil reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the gas and oil markets  events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with gas and oil properties 
for developed properties  the review consists of a comparison of the carrying value of the asset with the asset s expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest costs 
as a result of such assessment  the company recorded no impairment provision attributable to developed properties for the six months ended december  and the years ended june  and however  during the year ended december   an impairment of million was recorded on certain of the company s eastern colorado properties primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices 
in addition  an impairment of million was recorded on certain oklahoma properties that were held for sale at december  for fiscal year  we are continuing to develop and evaluate certain proved and unproved properties on which favorable or unfavorable results or commodity prices may cause us to revise in future quarters our estimates of those properties future cash flows 
such revisions of estimates could require us to record an impairment in the period of such revisions 
commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities we may periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts or fixed price physical contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we primarily utilize future contracts  swaps or options  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counterparties of high credit quality that we believe are minimal credit risks 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
due to the hedge effectiveness dependence upon future cash flows  production and reserve estimates and market price conditions  the hedges are continually re evaluated for effectiveness 
if at any time the hedges are determined to be ineffective  we could lose qualification for hedge accounting which could have a material impact on our statement of operations 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized and realized gains and losses are recorded as other expense or income in the consolidated statement of operations 
asset retirement obligation we account for our asset retirement obligations under sfas no

fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as it is used in sfas no 
the company applied the guidance of fin beginning july   resulting in no impact on its financial statements 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to account for its deferred tax assets and liabilities 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
ultimately  realization of a deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback carryforward period to absorb future deductible temporary differences or a carryforward 
in assessing the realizability of deferred 
table of contents tax assets  management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers all available evidence both positive and negative in determining whether a valuation allowance is required 
such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment  and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence 
as a result of management s current assessment  the company maintains a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets 
the company will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in its reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes will be utilized prior to their expiration 
as a result  the company may determine that the deferred tax asset valuation allowance should be increased or decreased 
such changes would impact net income through offsetting changes in income tax expense 
recently issued accounting standards and pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas aims to improve the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements by creating a single definition of fair value 
the statement emphasizes that fair value is not entity specific  but instead is a market based measurement of an asset or liability 
sfas upholds the requirements of previously issued pronouncements concerning fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate and price risk we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging meaningful portions of our expected production through the use of derivatives  including costless collars  swaps  and puts 
the level of our hedging activity and the duration of the instruments employed depend upon our view of market conditions  available hedge prices and our operating strategy 
we use hedges to limit the risk of fluctuating cash flows that fund our capital expenditure program 
we also may use hedges in conjunction with acquisitions to achieve expected economic returns during the payout period 

table of contents the net fair value of our derivative instruments was a million asset at december  and a million asset on march  the current derivative contracts cover approximately bcfe of our estimated production 
assuming production and the percent of oil and gas sold remained unchanged from the year ended december   a hypothetical decline in the average market price the company realized during the year ended december  on unhedged production would reduce the company s oil and natural gas revenues by approximately million on an annual basis 
interest rate risk we were subject to interest rate risk on million of variable rate debt obligations at december  the annual effect of a ten percent change in interest rates would be approximately million 
the interest rate on these variable debt obligations approximates current market rates as of december
