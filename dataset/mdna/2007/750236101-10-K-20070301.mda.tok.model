overview of business results as a holder of credit risk  our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the credit performance of the underlying insured assets 
we experienced generally positive results throughout the business for the year ended december   led by strong credit performance and good production despite the challenging business production environment for mortgage insurance and financial guaranty insurance 
we believe that the production environment for mortgage insurance has improved in as the industry appears to be recovering some of the business that has been lost to alternative products over the last few years 
although much of the prime mortgage market is still subject to these alternative products  such as mortgages  higher interest rates and bank portfolios that are more concentrated with home equity loans have begun to shift some of that market back to the mortgage insurance industry 
purchase volume in the mortgage industry in remained relatively strong and refinancings decreased to of primary new insurance written in compared to in the persistency rate  which is defined as the percentage of insurance in force that remains on our books after any month period  was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  persistency during increased mostly due to the decline in refinancing activity as discussed above 
although persistency has trended up  the shift in our product mix during the last couple of years to a larger percentage of structured business will likely temper the continued growth in overall persistency rates 
the persistency rate for structured products during the twelve months ended december  was compared to for our flow business 
there is a demand from lenders for structured transactions and non traditional products  although the volume of such business we write typically fluctuates between periods and is driven by market factors such as credit spreads and competition from capital market transactions 
although the volume of structured transactions in the first half of was strong  our volume declined significantly in the second half of due to the lack of opportunities to write this business at adequate returns on equity 
revenues have remained relatively flat from the prior year due mainly to a small amount of growth in our insurance in force  offset by significantly lower premium rates on much of the recently written structured business 
during  we continued to write the majority of our structured primary business in a second loss risk position 
there is a lower average premium rate associated with this business  reflecting the more remote risk associated with this business due to the existence of deductibles in front of our risk position 
premium growth will not mirror the growth in new insurance written from these lower premium products  resulting in what we 
table of contents expect could be a modest  near term reduction in earned premium 
positively  the capital allocation requirements resulting from these transactions are lower  commensurate with the more remote risk  and we believe these products are less directly vulnerable to a decline in housing values than higher premium  first loss products 
in addition  we expect that any premium reduction in will be offset somewhat by premiums from nims and other structured business that closed in the fourth quarter of in  we experienced an increase in mortgage insurance loss reserves  due to  among other things  an increase in older delinquencies and pending claims  which require greater loss reserve amounts due to the increased likelihood of claim payment  and an increase in severity 
approximately million of the increase in reserves at year end is attributable to our share of a second lien structured transaction in which we split losses with our counterparty on a basis 
see results of operations mortgage insurance year ended december  compared to year ended december  provision for losses below 
the factors resulting in an increase in reserves were offset somewhat by a reduction in delinquencies and positive results from our increased loss management efforts  which we ve incorporated into our loss reserve model 
claims paid in our mortgage insurance segment were lower than anticipated in  in part because of the intensified efforts of our loss management area  which has been scrutinizing more claims both first and second lien for which additional information or clarification is required 
we expect that claims paid in the first quarter of will be approximately million as we expect that some of the claims we have held longer as part of our intensified loss management efforts will be worked through 
our expectation  which is subject to change as a result of risks and uncertainties  is for claims paid to be approximately to million and for claims paid to be approximately to million 
we remain cautious about the outlook for the housing market  especially in certain parts of the country including the midwest and the east and west coasts 
in addition  as has been the case for the last several years  much of our business has not yet reached its peak claim period 
the mortgage insurance mix of business has continued to include a higher percentage of non prime business such as alternative a alt a and a minus mortgages and new unproven products such as interest only loans and pay option adjustable rate mortgages arms 
we expect to continue to increase our insurance of new and emerging products with which we have less experience both domestically and internationally  which adds to the uncertainty of future credit performance 
premiums received for these products are usually higher than more traditional products and often have structuring features such as deductibles that benefit our risk position 
we protect against losses that may occur in excess of our expectations on some of the risk associated with non prime and unproven products by reinsuring it through smart home transactions 
in  we developed smart home as a way to effectively transfer risk from our portfolio to investors in the capital markets 
ceded premiums written for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
ceded premiums earned for  and were million  million and million  respectively  related to the smart home transactions 
as of december   there have been no ceded losses as a result of the smart home transactions 
since august  we have completed four smart home arrangements 
details of these transactions aggregated as of the initial closing of each transaction and as of december  are as follows initial as of december  pool of mortgages par value billion billion risk in force par value billion billion notes sold to investors risk ceded principal amount million million smart home protects us against catastrophic loss as we continue to take on higher risk  concentrated positions and unproven products 
as a result  we consider smart home arrangements to be important to our ability to effectively manage our risk profile  especially  in the non prime market 
approximately and of 
table of contents our primary mortgage insurance risk in force was included in smart home arrangements at december  and  respectively 
in these transactions  we reinsure the middle layer risk positions  while retaining a significant portion of the total risk comprising the first loss and most remote risk positions 
in the financial guaranty segment  we are encouraged by s p s affirmation earlier this year of the aa ratings for radian asset assurance and raal and its decision to revise its outlook for these companies upward to stable 
we believe that s p s affirmation and outlook improvement will help validate our business model and present additional opportunities for the business in the future 
new business production was strong during the year considering the relatively low issuances of municipal bonds and a continuation of tight credit spreads  which impacted premium rates as well as our ability to close transactions 
credit performance was generally good during the year 
we also continued to write more of our structured business in a super senior  more remote risk position  albeit at lower premium rates 
we expect that revenues in our financial guaranty segment will remain relatively stable for  excluding unusual items like refundings and the impact of the run off in our trade credit reinsurance business 
for  the financial services segment showed another year of strong earnings and return on investment  which was  in part  a result of the relatively low interest rate and favorable credit environment and a strong demand from investors in asset backed securities  which were issued at more favorable rates 
in addition  both c bass and sherman were positively impacted in the fourth quarter of by certain items sherman incurred a significant gain on sold portfolios during the quarter and c bass recovered most of the hedge losses that had been incurred in prior quarters 
despite the significant credit spread widening that has occurred in the subprime mortgage market during the first quarter of  which could produce mark to market losses for c bass during the first quarter  we expect that both c bass s and sherman s results for will remain fairly consistent with their results  as both companies stand to benefit from recurring sources of earnings 
we expect continued growth in sherman s credit card origination business  and  while the sub prime origination business is currently uncertain  c bass typically looks for opportunities to purchase mispriced assets in such an environment 
on february   c bass entered into an agreement to acquire fieldstone investment corporation  a mortgage banking company that originates  sells  and invests primarily in non conforming single family residential mortgage loans with a current portfolio of over billion  for approximately million in cash 
the transaction  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of  subject to regulatory and other approvals  supports c bass s strategy of aligning with companies that have significant investments in mortgage securities  where c bass s wholly owned subsidiary  litton loan servicing  as servicer  can enhance the underlying value of these securities 
in addition  if approved  the transaction will provide c bass with a platform for loan originations

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income 
other income for was million  a million or decrease from million in other income mostly includes income related to contract underwriting services  which was lower for as compared to due to less demand for this service 
provision for losses 
the provision for losses for was million  compared to million for this decrease is mostly due to a decrease in primary delinquencies and claims received year over year  as well as the incorporation into our loss reserve model of positive results from our heightened loss management efforts throughout on both first and second lien delinquencies 
despite a decrease in delinquencies  there has been a shift in existing delinquencies to the later stages of delinquencies  which requires a higher reserve as these delinquencies are closer to a claim payment or foreclosure

our total net exposure under this second lien structured transaction is approximately million  or half of the million in total gross exposure relating to the transaction

includes approximately  and  defaults at december  and december   respectively  where reserves have not been established because no claim payment is currently anticipated 
the default and claim cycle in the mortgage insurance business begins with our receipt of a default notice from the insured 
generally  the insured notifies us of a default within days after the loan has become days past due 
for reporting and internal tracking purposes  we do not consider a loan to be in default until the loan has been in default for days

table of contents claim activity is not spread evenly throughout the coverage period of a book of business 
relatively few claims on prime business are received during the first two years following issuance of a policy and on non prime business during the first year 
historically  claim activity on prime loans has reached its highest level in the third through fifth years after the year of policy origination  and on non prime loans this level is expected to be reached in the second through fourth years 
approximately of our primary risk in force and approximately of our pool risk in force at december  had not yet reached its highest claim frequency years 
because it is difficult to predict both the timing of originating new business and the cancellation rate of existing business  it is also difficult to predict  at any given time  the percentage of risk in force that will reach its highest claim frequency years on any future date 
direct claims paid for were million compared to million for and million for the average claim paid has fluctuated over the past few years mostly due to differing coverage amounts and loan balances 
in addition  changes in real estate values may also affect the amount of the average claim paid 
claims paid on second lien mortgages continue to increase as a result of an increase in the volume of second lien business written over the past few years on which we have begun paying claims  partially offset by an increase in recoveries 
a significant amount of risk written on second lien business during the year ended december  and  was in a second loss position 
year ended december in thousands  unless specified otherwise states with highest claims paid ohio texas michigan georgia colorado percentage of total claims paid ohio texas michigan georgia colorado a higher level of claims exist in the auto states of ohio  michigan and indiana  as problems with the domestic auto industry and related industries depress economic growth  employment and house prices in these states 
a higher level of claims in texas resulted  in part  from unemployment levels that were higher than the national average and lower home price appreciation 
we believe that claims in the midwest and southeast have been rising and will continue to rise due to the weak industrial sector of the economy 
we also believe that increased claims in michigan and north carolina are a result of declining economic conditions in those areas and that in colorado  increased claims are a result of a significant decline in property values in that area 
a higher incidence of claims in georgia is directly related to what our risk management department believes to be questionable property values 
several years ago  our risk management department implemented several property valuation checks and balances to mitigate the risk of this issue recurring  and now applies these same techniques to all mortgage insurance transactions 
we expect this higher incidence of claims in georgia to continue until loans originated in georgia before the implementation of these preventive measures become sufficiently seasoned 
since august   the date that hurricane katrina first struck and caused extensive property damage to the us gulf coast  we have paid approximately million in claims on mortgage insurance written in areas damaged by hurricanes katrina and rita as designated by freddie mac  the designated areas as of december   including approximately million for claims received after august  
table of contents while we experienced an increase in defaults in mortgage insurance in designated areas in the months following the hurricanes  defaults have been steadily decreasing since then approximately  defaults remain outstanding as of december   which is down from  defaults at december  we remain uncertain as to how many claims we ultimately may have to pay on these defaults 
the organizations servicing these loans have reported defaults  in some cases  despite the existence of forbearance agreements that permit homeowners to defer mortgage payments on these loans 
limitations also exist in our master policy of insurance that could prevent us from paying all or part of a claim 
for example  we are permitted to adjust a claim where the property underlying a mortgage in default is subject to unrestored physical damage 
we have taken a view that these loans will not perform better or worse than any other delinquencies 
as of december   we had established a related mortgage insurance loss reserve of million related to the  hurricane katrina and rita related defaults  including a reserve of million for approximately defaults associated with heavily damaged areas

change in fair value of derivative instruments 
change in the fair value of derivative instruments was a gain of million for compared to a gain of million for in the fourth quarter of  we refined our mark to market model for valuing corporate collateralized debt obligations  to reflect actual credit spreads by individual name  when available  as compared to our previous version of the model which used average spreads for similarly rated names 
while application of the new model resulted in minimal changes for most of our derivative transactions  one high yield synthetic obligation showed a large difference due to greater spread volatility in the high yield corporate names included in this transaction 
at december   our refined model indicated that we had incurred a million loss on this transaction  resulting in a million mark to market adjustment in on march   radian asset assurance and its counterparty to this transaction agreed to terminate this transaction and to amend the one other derivative financial guaranty contract that we have insured with this same counterparty 
as a result  included in the change in the fair value of derivative instruments for  was a million charge in connection with the termination of this derivative contract 
on february   the counterparty also terminated the transaction amended in march  at no cost to either party 
as a result of this termination  we will have a million gain in the fair value of derivative instruments for the first quarter of the remaining change in fair value of derivatives instruments for was mostly a result of the moderate tightening of spreads related to synthetic collateralized debt obligations in  compared to severe tightening in  and a decrease in the duration until maturity on remaining deals

we closely monitor our financial guaranty obligations and we use an internal classification process to identify and track troubled credits 
we classify credits as intensified surveillance credits when we determine that continued performance is questionable and  in the absence of a positive change  may result in a claim 
at december   and  the financial guaranty segment had the following exposure on credits classified as intensified surveillance credits december december december of credits par outstanding of credits par outstanding of credits par outstanding in millions less than greater than total 
table of contents we establish loss reserves on our non derivative financial guaranty contracts as discussed in critical accounting policies reserve for losses in this item and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have allocated non specific reserves of million on five intensified surveillance credits representing an aggregate par amount of million at december  we expect that we will suffer losses with respect to these insured obligations approximately equal to the total amount reserved 
in comparison  we had allocated non specific reserves of million on three credits at december  and million on one credit at december  there is one credit at december  for which we have not allocated a specific reserve that  without a positive change  is likely to default in the near term and could potentially result in a material claim 
based on currently available information  we expect that any claim from this credit  to the extent one arises  would range from a minimal amount up to slightly more than of the million in total par outstanding 
the potential amount of any claim is not estimable at this point  in part  because of the availability of a number of strategic alternatives currently under consideration and other mitigating factors that could reduce or delay any payment from us 
two of the six intensified surveillance credits with million or greater in exposure identified at december  and one of the six intensified surveillance credits with million or greater in exposure identified at december  were derivative financial guaranty contracts 
one of these credits at december   representing million in exposure  was terminated in march as discussed above in change in fair value of derivative instruments 
the second credit at december   which represented million in exposure  expired in november  without claim 
there were no direct derivative financial guaranty contracts on the intensified surveillance list as of december  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we do not establish loss reserves on our derivative financial guaranty contracts 
instead  gains and losses on derivative financial guaranty contracts are derived from internally generated models that take into account both credit and market spreads and are recorded through our consolidated statements of income

singer had been engaged in the purchase  servicing  and securitization of assets  including state lottery awards and structured settlement payments 
singer s run off operations consist of servicing and or disposing of singer s previously originated assets and servicing its non consolidated special purpose vehicles 
the results of this subsidiary are not material to our financial results 
at december   we had approximately million and million of non consolidated assets and liabilities  respectively  associated with singer special purpose vehicles 
our investment in these special purpose vehicles was million at december  contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  including payments under operating lease agreements  are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as liabilities but represent a contractual commitment to pay 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
although the majority of our loss reserves do not represent contractual obligations and commitments under the securities and exchange commission sec definition  they are included in the table because they represent management s estimate of the claims that we will be required to pay on our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty contracts 
the table also reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding debt

this new facility bears interest on any amounts drawn at a rate dependent on our credit rating at the time of borrowing and will be calculated according to  at our option  a base rate or a eurocurrency rate  plus an applicable margin and utilization fee 
if necessary  this facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
there were no drawdowns on the expired facility  and we have not drawn down any amounts under the new facility through december  as part of the equity allocation component of our investment program  we have committed to invest million in alternative investments that are primarily private equity structures 
at december   we had unfunded commitments of million 
these commitments have capital calls over a period of at least six years  and certain fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
we also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur contingent commitments 
we do not currently expect that these contingent commitments will result in any amounts being paid by us 
we also utilize letters of credit to back assumed reinsurance contracts  medical insurance policies and an excise tax exemption certificate used for ceded premiums from our domestic operations to our international operations 
these letters of credit are with various financial institutions  have terms of one year and will automatically renew unless we specify otherwise

new securities regulations became effective in that impose enhanced disclosure requirements on issuers of asset backed including mortgaged backed securities  including most customers in our structured business 
to allow these customers to comply with the new regulations  we may be required in any given transaction  depending on the amount of credit enhancement that we are providing  to provide audited financial statements for the insurance subsidiary participating in the transaction 
we are in the process of producing financial statements and having them audited for each of our primary insurance subsidiaries

to date  we have guaranteed two structured transactions for radian guaranty with approximately million of remaining credit exposure 
off balance sheet arrangements we guarantee the payment of up to million of a revolving credit facility issued to sherman which expires in december our guaranty facilitates the issuance and renewal of the facility  which sherman may use for general corporate purposes 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at december  investments we are required to group assets in our investment portfolio into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
fixed maturity securities for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of tax reported as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
investments classified as trading securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of tax reported as a separate component of income 
during  we began classifying certain new security purchases as trading securities 

table of contents similar securities were classified as available for sale for periods prior to for securities classified as either available for sale or held to maturity  we conduct a quarterly evaluation of declines in market value of the securities to determine whether the decline is other than temporary 
if the fair value of a security is below the cost basis  and it is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value through earnings as a realized loss  and the fair value becomes the new basis 
during  we recorded approximately million of charges related to declines in the fair value of securities mainly small cap value stocks and convertible securities considered to be other than temporary 
there were no such charges in and at december   and  there were no other investments held in the portfolio that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification method and are included in income 
our evaluation of market declines for other than temporary impairment is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
we consider a wide range of factors about the security and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by us in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost or amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi the company s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the full recovery of its value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost  vii unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on asset backed securities  and viii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies

dividends from our subsidiaries  which may include dividends they have received from our affiliates c bass and sherman  and permitted payments to us under our tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  along with income from our investment portfolio  are our principal sources of cash to pay stockholder dividends and to meet our obligations 
these obligations include our operating expenses  taxes and interest and principal payments on debt 
the payment of dividends and other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by insurance laws and regulations 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval 
in addition  although we have expense sharing arrangements in place with our principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their share of holding company level expenses  including interest expense on our long term debt  these expense sharing arrangements may be changed at any time by the applicable state insurance departments 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us  and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  is subject to various conditions imposed by the rating agencies for us to maintain our ratings 
if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to tax and expense sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund our obligations  we may be required to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt  by issuing additional equity or by selling assets  which we may be unable to do on favorable terms  if at all 
the need to raise additional capital or the failure to make timely payments on our obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
during  we received million in dividends from our mortgage insurance operating subsidiaries 
our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount that they may pay in dividends to us during the next months without first obtaining insurance department approval 
we expect to receive modest dividends from our operating subsidiaries throughout and do not currently expect to seek any extraordinary dividends 
c bass paid million and million in dividends to us during and  respectively 
sherman paid million and million of dividends to us during and  respectively 
sherman also paid us a million dividend in january all dividends from c bass and sherman are initially distributed to our insurance subsidiaries  and therefore are subject to regulatory limitations  as discussed above 
we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service irs for the through tax years 
to date  the irs examination remains in the discovery phase and no formal notice of proposed adjustment has been received 
however  the irs has indicated that it opposes the recognition of certain tax losses that were generated through our investment in a portfolio of residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics 
the irs has indicated that it may issue a formal notice of proposed adjustment upon its completion of discovery which is anticipated to conclude during the fourth quarter of we will contest any proposed adjustment relating to the irs s opposition of the tax losses in question 
upon receipt of the irs s proposed adjustment we may make a payment on account with the united states department of the treasury in order to avoid the accrual of the above market rate interest associated with management s estimate of the

we currently anticipate that funding the payment on account could occur during the fourth quarter of or the first quarter of  and we estimate the capital requirement for such payment to be approximately million 
any ultimate overpayment associated with the payment on account would be recovered through a formal claim for refund process 
our insurance subsidiaries are permitted to allocate capital resources within certain insurance department and rating agency guidelines by making direct investments 
in march  radian guaranty contributed approximately million in capital to radian insurance to support the additional risk that has been  and is expected to be  written in that entity  mostly through non traditional products  such as domestic or international credit default swaps

short term liquidity needs our liquidity needs over the next months include funds for the payment of dividends on our common stock  debt service payments on our outstanding long term debt  claim payments on our insured obligations  operating expenses and potentially  to fund a payment on account related to the irs investigation described above 
we expect to fund these requirements with amounts received under our expense sharing arrangements or as dividends from our insurance operating subsidiaries  subject to regulatory requirements  which may include dividends to these subsidiaries from our affiliates c bass and sherman  and from working capital  all of which we expect to be sufficient to make such payments for at least the next months 
based on our current intention to pay quarterly common stock dividends of approximately per share and assuming that our common stock outstanding remains constant at  shares outstanding at december   we would require approximately million to pay our next four quarterly dividends 
we will also require approximately million annually to pay the debt service on our outstanding long term debt 
our sources of working capital consist mostly of premiums written by our insurance operating subsidiaries and investment income at both the holding company and operating subsidiary levels 
working capital is applied mainly to the payment of our insurance operating subsidiaries claims  operating expenses and to fund our stock repurchase programs 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december   were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the lower cash flow from operations in resulted mainly from higher net payments on the settlement of financial guaranty contracts and an increase in prepaid federal income taxes 
in  we paid million as a result of the recapture 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and other expenses 
we believe that the operating cash flows generated by each of our insurance subsidiaries will provide those subsidiaries with sufficient funds to satisfy their claim payments and operating expenses for at least the next months 
in the unlikely event that claim payment obligations and operating expenses exceed the operating cash flows generated by our insurance operating subsidiaries  we believe that we have the ability to fund any excess from sales of short term investments maintained at the holding company 
at december   we had cash and liquid investment securities of million 
in the unlikely event that we are unable to fund excess claim payments and operating expenses through the sale of short term investments  we may be required to incur unanticipated capital losses or delays in connection with the sale of less liquid securities held by us 
in any event  we do not anticipate the need for borrowings  under credit facilities or otherwise  to satisfy claim payment obligations or other operating expenses

radian asset securities in turn entered into a series of three perpetual put options on its own preferred stock on substantially identical terms to the radian asset assurance preferred stock 
the counterparties to the radian asset securities put options are three trusts established by two major investment banks

critical accounting policies sec guidance defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized available information including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below 
reserve for losses we establish reserves to provide for losses and the estimated costs of settling claims in both the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments 
setting loss reserves in both businesses involves significant use of estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
in the mortgage insurance segment  reserves for losses generally are not established until we are notified that a borrower has missed two payments 
we also establish reserves for associated loss adjustment expenses lae  consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process  including legal and other fees and 
table of contents expenses associated with administering the claims process 
sfas no 
 sfas accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises  specifically excludes mortgage guaranty insurance from its guidance relating to the reserve for losses 
we maintain an extensive database of claim payment history and use models  based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by its servicer  and macroeconomic factors such as regional economic conditions that involve significant variability over time  as well as more static factors such as the estimated foreclosure period in the area where the default exists  to help determine the likelihood that a default will result in a claim referred to as the claim rate  the amount that we will pay if a default becomes a claim referred to as claim severity and based on these estimates  the appropriate loss reserve at any point in time 
as a result of our continued evaluation of historical data  in the fourth quarter of  we made adjustments to the claim rate estimates of our model  mostly to incorporate the results of our intensified loss management efforts throughout with respect to delinquent loans that are in an early stage of delinquency  considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels 
adjustments in estimates for delinquent loans in the early stage of delinquency are more volatile in nature than for loans that are in the later stage of delinquency  which generally require a larger reserve 
as the delinquency proceeds toward foreclosure  there is more certainty around these estimates as a result of the aged status of the delinquent loan  and adjustments are made to loss reserves to reflect this updated information 
if a default cures historically  a large percentage of defaulted loans have cured before going to claim  the reserve for that loan is removed from the reserve for losses and lae 
this curing process causes an appearance of a reduction in reserves from prior years if the reduction in reserves from cures is greater than the additional reserves for those loans that are nearing foreclosure or have become claims 
we also reserve for defaults that we believe to have occurred but that have not been reported to us on a timely basis by lending institutions 
all estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are made as they become necessary 
we generally do not establish reserves for loans that are in default if we believe that we will not be liable for the payment of a claim with respect to that default 
for example  for those defaults in which we are in a second loss position  we calculate what the reserve would have been if there had been no deductible 
if the existing deductible is greater than the reserve amount for any given default  we do not establish a reserve for the default 
consistent with gaap and industry accounting practices  we generally do not establish loss reserves for expected future claims on insured mortgages that are not in default or believed to be in default 
our model differentiates between prime and non prime products and takes into account the different loss development patterns and borrower behavior that is inherent in these products  whether we are in a first or second loss position and whether there are deductibles on the loan 
we use actuarial projection methodologies to produce a range of reserves by product and a midpoint for each product based on historical factors such as ultimate claim rates and claim severity 
in determining the amount of reserve to be recorded  we begin with the calculated midpoint and then we evaluate other conditions  such as current economic conditions  regional housing conditions and the reliability of historical data for new products  to determine if an adjustment to the midpoint calculated by the model is necessary 
the following table shows the mortgage insurance range of loss and lae reserves  as determined by our actuaries  and recorded reserves for losses and lae  as of december  and as of december  as of december  loss and lae reserves in millions low high recorded low high recorded mortgage insurance operations 
table of contents at december  and  we made a judgment to reserve at a level above the midpoint  given the uncertainty around the ultimate performance of our defaulted non prime products and the potential overpricing in certain housing markets 
we considered the sensitivity on loss reserve estimates by assessing the potential changes resulting from a hypothetical parallel shift in severity and claim rate 
for example  assuming all other factors remain constant  for every change in claim severity or claim rate  we estimated a million change in our loss reserves 
in the financial guaranty segment  we establish loss reserves on our non derivative financial guaranty contracts 
we establish case reserves for specifically identified impaired credits that have defaulted and allocated non specific reserves for specific credits that we expect to default 
in addition  we establish unallocated non specific reserves for our entire portfolio based on estimated statistical loss probabilities 
as discussed below  the reserving policies used by the financial guaranty industry are continuing to evolve and are subject to change 
our financial guaranty loss reserve policy requires management to make the following key estimates and judgments setting both case reserves and allocated non specific reserves requires us to exercise judgment in estimating the severity of the claim that is likely to result from an identified reserving event  which may be any amount up to the full amount of the insured obligation 
the reliability of this estimate depends on the reliability of the information regarding the likely severity of the claim and the judgments made by management with respect to that information 
even when we are aware of the occurrence of an event that requires the establishment of a reserve  our estimate of the severity of the claim that is likely to result from that event may not ultimately be correct 
at december   we had case reserves and lae reserves on financial guaranty policies of million 
of this amount  million was attributable to a single manufactured housing transaction originated and serviced by conseco finance corp 
we have a high degree of certainty that we will suffer losses with respect to this insured obligation equal to the amount reserved  which equals the total amount of the remaining insured obligation 
the case and lae reserves also include million attributable to reinsured obligations on which our total par outstanding is million 
these reserves are established based on amounts conveyed to us by the ceding companies and confirmed by us 
we do not have any reasonable expectation that the ultimate losses will deviate materially from the amount reserved 
the remaining million of case and lae reserves is attributable to eight insured obligations for which we have case and lae reserves established  partially offset by salvage recoveries on one other insured obligation 
at december   five credits were included in our allocated non specific reserves of million 
we expect that we will suffer losses with respect to these insured obligations approximately equal to the amount reserved of million 
these credits have a par amount of million 
our unallocated non specific reserves are established over time by applying expected default factors to the premiums earned during each reporting period 
the expected lifetime losses for each credit are determined by multiplying the expected frequency of losses on that credit by the expected severity of losses on that credit and multiplying this number  the loss factor  by that credit s outstanding par amount 
the expected frequency and severity of losses for each credit is generated from three sources two that are published by major rating agencies and one that is generated by a proprietary internal model based on the product class  published rating and term to maturity for each credit 
we set the expected lifetime losses for each credit at a point in the range between the highest and lowest expected lifetime loss factors generated by the rating agency and internally generated models 
the default rates published by rating agencies tend to be very low because we mostly insure investment grade obligations that  historically  have a very low probability of default 
although the default rate is low  the amount of losses upon default can be very high because we tend to insure large financial obligations 
because of 
table of contents the low incidence of losses on financial guaranty obligations  it is also very difficult to estimate the timing of losses on our insured obligations for which we have not yet established a case reserve or allocated non specific reserve 
the default factors for the years ended december  and  approximated of earned premiums on public finance credits and of earned premiums on structured finance credits 
our unallocated non specific loss reserve at december   was million 
the range between the unallocated non specific reserves that would have resulted from applying the highest and lowest default factors generated by any of the three models was approximately million to million  which we believe provides a reasonably likely range of expected losses 
none of the product types that we insure accounted for a materially disproportionate share of the variability within that range 
at each balance sheet date  we also evaluate both the model generated default factors and our unallocated non specific reserves against management s subjective view of qualitative factors to ensure that the default factors and the unallocated non specific reserves represent management s best estimate of the expected losses on our portfolio of credits for which we have not established a case reserve or an allocated non specific reserve 
these qualitative factors include existing economic and business conditions  overall credit quality trends resulting from industry  geographic  economic and political conditions  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  changes in underwriting policies and procedures and seasoning of the book of business 
the macroeconomic factors that we evaluate are outside of our control and are subject to considerable variability 
the company specific factors that we evaluate also require us to make subjective judgments 
in addition  a significant change in the size of our portfolio underlying the unallocated non specific reserves  such as through the expiration of policies or the refunding or recapture of insured exposures  could require an adjustment to the default factors or our level of unallocated non specific reserves 
to date  our evaluation of these qualitative factors has not led us to adjust the default factors or our level of unallocated non specific reserves 
our estimates of our reserves for losses and lae for our financial guaranty segment s other lines of business  mainly trade credit reinsurance  depend upon the receipt of accurate information on claims and loss estimates from ceding companies 
in addition  a reserve is included for losses and lae incurred but not reported ibnr  on trade credit reinsurance 
as the business is now in run off  the receipt of information from ceding companies is likely to be more sporadic and the setting of reserves will be more reliant on management estimates 
we use historical loss information and make inquiries to the cedants of known events as a means of validating our loss assumptions 
setting the loss reserves in both business segments involves significant reliance upon estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
the models and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate  especially during an extended economic downturn 
we cannot be certain that we have correctly estimated the necessary amount of reserves or that the reserves established will be adequate to cover ultimate losses on incurred defaults 
in january and february  we discussed with the sec staff  both separately and together with other members of the financial guaranty industry  the differences in loss reserve practices followed by different financial guaranty industry participants 
on june   the fasb added a project to its agenda to consider the accounting by insurers for financial guaranty insurance 
the fasb s objective is to provide guidance with respect to the timing of claim liability recognition  premium recognition and the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  specifically for financial guaranty contracts issued by insurance companies that are not accounted for as derivative contracts under sfas no 
the goal is to reduce diversity in accounting by financial guaranty insurers  thereby enabling users to better understand and more readily compare the insurers financial statements 
the fasb is also expected to examine the appropriate accounting model for other insurance products with similar characteristics  such as mortgage guaranty contracts and trade credit insurance 
proposed and final guidance from the fasb regarding accounting for financial guaranty insurance is expected to be issued in when and if the fasb or the sec reaches a conclusion on these issues  we and the rest of the financial guaranty and mortgage insurance industries may be required to change some aspects of our accounting policies 

table of contents if the fasb or the sec were to determine that we should account for our financial guaranty contracts differently  for example by requiring them to be treated solely as one or the other of short duration or long duration contracts under sfas no 
 this determination could impact our accounting for loss reserves  premium revenue and deferred acquisition costs  all of which are covered by sfas no 
management is unable to estimate what impact  if any  the ultimate resolution of this issue will have on our financial condition or operating results 
derivative instruments and hedging activity we account for derivatives under sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted 
some of the fixed maturity securities included in our investment portfolio and certain of our mortgage and financial guaranty contracts are considered derivatives 
under sfas no 
 the convertible debt and redeemable preferred securities included in our investment portfolio must be characterized as hybrid securities because they generally combine both debt and equity characteristics 
the hybrid classification requires that the convertible security valuation be separated into a fixed income component and an equity derivative component 
valuation changes on the fixed income component are recorded as other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets while valuation changes on the equity derivative component are recorded as net gains and losses on our consolidated statements of income 
we believe that the market valuation of each hybrid convertible security is appropriately allocated to its fixed income and equity derivative components 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments sfas no 
 an amendment of sfas no 
and statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
i permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  ii clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 
 iii establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  iv clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and v amends sfas no 
to eliminate the exemption from applying the requirements of sfas no 
on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
we are required to adjust retained earnings for fair value amounts related to financial instruments now recorded at fair value 
the implementation of sfas no 
 effective january   will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we account for certain mortgage insurance contracts such as nims transactions  as derivative contracts under sfas no 
we have developed a model that estimates the fair value of our nims transactions 
the model is based on various factors such as recent premium levels and the present value of future estimated cash flows 
the gains and losses on direct derivative financial guaranty contracts are derived from internally generated models 
the gains and losses on assumed derivative financial guaranty contracts are provided by the primary insurance companies 
with respect to our direct derivative financial guaranty contracts  estimated fair value amounts are determined by us using market information to the extent available  and appropriate valuation methodologies 
for cdos  credit spreads on individual names in our collateral pool are used to determine an equivalent risk tranche on an industry standard credit default swap index 
we then estimate the price of our equivalent risk tranche based on observable market prices of standard risk tranches on the industry standard credit default swap index 
when credit spreads on individual names are not available  the average credit spread on the credit rating of the name is used 
for certain structured transactions  dealer quotes on similar structured transactions are used 
for certain structured transactions where market data is not available  no gains or losses are recorded 
significant differences may exist with respect to the available market information and assumptions 
table of contents used to determine gains and losses on derivative financial guaranty contracts 
considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts we could realize in a current market exchange due to the lack of a liquid market 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
in the fourth quarter of  we refined our mark to market model to use actual credit spreads by individual name  when available as discussed above  as compared to our previous version of the model  which used average spreads for similarly rated names 
while application of the new model resulted in immaterial changes for most of our derivative financial guaranty transactions  one synthetic cdo showed a large difference due to greater spread volatility in the underlying high yield corporate names included in this transaction 
on march   radian asset assurance paid million to its counterparty in consideration for the termination of this transaction 
a summary of our derivative information as of and for the periods indicated is as follows december in millions balance sheet trading securities amortized cost fair value derivative financial guaranty contracts notional value gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses net unrealized gains the components of the change in fair value of derivative instruments are as follows year ended december in millions income statement trading securities gain on forward contracts gain on termination of treasury rate lock derivative financial guaranty contracts net gains 
table of contents the following table presents information at december  and related to net unrealized gains losses on derivative financial guaranty contracts included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
december december in millions balance at january net losses gains recorded defaults recoveries payments early termination payments balance at end of period the application of sfas no 
 as amended  could result in volatility from period to period in gains and losses as reported on our consolidated statements of income 
these gains and losses are mostly the result of changes in corporate credit spreads  changes in the creditworthiness of underlying corporate entities  and the equity performance of the entities underlying the convertible investments 
any incurred gains or losses on such contracts would be recognized as a change in the fair value of derivatives 
we are unable to predict the affect this volatility may have on our financial condition or results of operations 
we record premiums and origination costs related to credit default swaps and certain other derivative contracts in premiums written and policy acquisition costs  respectively  on our consolidated statements of income 
our classification of these contracts is the same whether we are a direct insurer or we assume these contracts 
in accordance with our risk management policies  we may enter into derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk related to our long term debt 
as of december   we were a party to two interest rate swap contracts relating to our unsecured senior notes due these interest rate swaps are designed as fair value hedges that hedge the change in fair value of our long term debt arising from interest rate increases 
during and  the fair value hedges were effective 
therefore  the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of income was offset by the change in the fair value of the hedged debt 
these interest rate swap contracts mature in february terms of the interest rate swap contracts at december  were as follows dollars in thousands notional amount rate received fixed rate paid floating a maturity date february  unrealized loss a the december  six month libor forward rate at the next swap payment date plus basis points 
deferred policy acquisition costs costs associated with the acquisition of mortgage insurance business  consisting of compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses  are initially deferred and reported as deferred policy acquisition costs 
because sfas no 
specifically excludes mortgage guaranty insurance from its guidance relating to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  amortization of these costs for each underwriting year book of business is charged against revenue in proportion to estimated gross profits over the estimated life of the policies using the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
this includes accruing interest on the unamortized 
table of contents balance of deferred policy acquisition costs 
estimates of expected gross profit including persistency and loss development assumptions for each underwriting year and product type used as a basis for amortization are evaluated regularly  and the total amortization recorded to date is adjusted by a charge or credit to the statement of income if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
considerable judgment is used in evaluating these factors when updating the assumptions 
the use of different assumptions would have a significant effect on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs in our financial guaranty business are comprised of those expenses that vary with  and are principally related to  the production of insurance premiums  including commissions paid on reinsurance assumed  salaries and related costs of underwriting and marketing personnel  rating agency fees  premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses  offset by commission income on premiums ceded to reinsurers 
acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned for each underwriting year 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is adjusted regularly based on the expected timing of both upfront and installment based premiums 
the estimation of installment based premiums requires considerable judgment  and different assumptions could produce different results 
origination costs for derivative mortgage and financial guaranty contracts are expensed as incurred 
as noted under reserve for losses above  the fasb is considering the accounting model used by the financial guaranty industry for deferred policy acquisition costs 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

as required under sfas no 
 our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized under the liability method which recognizes the future tax effect of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of these amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
as a mortgage guaranty and financial guaranty insurer  we are eligible for a tax deduction  subject to certain limitations  under section e of the internal revenue code for amounts required by state law or regulation to be set aside in statutory contingency reserves 
the deduction is allowed only to the extent that we purchase non interest bearing us mortgage guaranty tax and loss bonds t l bonds issued by the treasury department in an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from deducting any portion of our statutory contingency reserves 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service irs for the through tax years and are regularly audited by tax authorities in other countries and states in which we have significant business operations 
to date  the irs examination remains in the discovery phase and no formal notice of proposed adjustment has been received 
however  the irs has indicated that it opposes the recognition of certain tax losses that were generated through our investment in a portfolio of residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics 
the irs has indicated that it may issue a formal notice of proposed adjustment upon its completion of discovery which is anticipated to conclude during the fourth quarter of we will contest any proposed adjustment relating to the irs opposition of the tax losses in question 
we provide tax reserves for federal  state  local and international exposures relating to audit results  tax planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities 
we regularly assess the potential outcome of examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes 
the development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing  and is a subjective significant estimate 
once established  the reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves 
although the outcome of tax examinations is uncertain  in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities emanating from these reviews  including the current irs audit 
if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates  they could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and cash flows

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions 
examples of market risk include changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects of market risk exposures on our financial instruments  including in particular  investment securities and certain financial guaranty insurance contracts 
this analysis is performed by expressing the potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
the results of our sensitivity analysis at december  are as follows interest rate risk the primary market risk in our investment portfolio is interest rate risk  namely the fair value sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
we regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate risk 
as a result of the analysis  we have determined that the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investment assets is materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
we estimate the interest rate risk associated with our fixed income securities by modeling an instantaneous increase and decrease in interest rates 
as of december   hypothetical increases in interest rates of and basis points would cause decreases in the market value of our fixed income portfolio excluding short term investments of approximately from billion to billion and from billion to billion  respectively 
similarly  hypothetical decreases in interest rates of and basis points would cause increases in the market value of our fixed income portfolio excluding short term investments of approximately from billion to billion and from billion to billion  respectively 
in april  we entered into interest rate swaps that  in effect  converted a portion of our fixed rate long term debt to a variable rate based on a spread over the six month libor for the remaining term of the debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the market value and cost of our long term debt at december  was million and million  respectively 
foreign exchange rate risk one means of assessing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments is to model effects on reported earnings using a sensitivity analysis 
we analyzed our currency exposure as of december  by identifying our investment portfolio that is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our investment portfolio foreign currency exposures were remeasured  generally assuming a decrease in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
under this  with all other factors remaining constant  we estimated as of december  that such a decrease would reduce our investment portfolio held in foreign currencies by million 
equity market price exposure to changes in equity market prices can be estimated by assessing the potential changes in market values on our equity investments resulting from a hypothetical broad based decline in equity market prices of 
at december   the market value and cost of our equity securities were million and million  respectively 
there have been no material changes in our equity market price risk during the year ended december  
table of contents credit derivative risk we enter into derivative financial guaranty contracts  which include certain derivative financial guaranty contracts written through our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments 
gains and losses on our derivative financial guaranty contracts are derived from market pricing when available  otherwise  we use internally generated pricing models 
both methods take into account credit and market spreads and are recorded on our consolidated financial statements 
see critical accounting policies derivative instruments and hedging activity for a discussion of how we account for derivatives under sfas no
