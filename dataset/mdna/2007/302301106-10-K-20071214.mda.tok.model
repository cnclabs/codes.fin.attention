table of contents overview we lend or provide credit services to individuals who do not have cash resources or access to credit to meet their short term cash needs 
we offer pawn loans in domestic pawn stores  including fifteen acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  and four mexico pawn stores open at september  pawn loans are non recourse loans collateralized by tangible personal property 
at these stores  we also sell merchandise  primarily collateral forfeited from our pawn lending operations  to customers looking for good value 
in ezmoney stores and of our domestic pawn stores open september   we offer short term non collateralized loans  often called payday loans  or fee based credit services to customers seeking loans collectively  signature loans 
we manage our business as two segments 
the ezpawn operations segment offers pawn related activities in all pawn stores  and offers signature loans in pawn stores and six ezmoney stores 
the ezmoney operations segment offers signature loans in ezmoney stores  and accounts for approximately of our consolidated signature loan revenues 
the following tables present store data by operating segment year ended september  ezpawn ezmoney operations operations consolidated stores in operation beginning of period new openings acquired sold  combined  or closed end of period average number of stores during the period composition of ending stores ezpawn united states ezpawn mexico ezmoney signature loan stores adjoining ezpawns ezmoney signature loan stores free standing total stores in operation total stores offering signature loans year ended september  ezpawn ezmoney operations operations consolidated stores in operation beginning of period new openings acquired sold  combined  or closed end of period average number of stores during the period composition of ending stores ezpawn united states ezmoney signature loan stores adjoining ezpawns ezmoney signature loan stores free standing total stores in operation total stores offering signature loans

while allowable service charges vary by state and loan size  a majority of our pawn loans are in amounts that allow per month  or annually 
our average pawn loan amount typically ranges between and but varies depending on the valuation of each item pawned 
the total loan term  consisting of the primary term and grace period  ranges between and days 
between august and november  we reduced the total loan term on new pawn loans from days to days in of our pawn stores 
forty three stores had previously made the change 
we estimate this change reduced our pawn portfolio approximately for the loans in these stores that were between and days old  with very little or no impact on pawn service charge revenues 
this change also created a one time doubling of forfeitures in fiscal as loans made and days earlier simultaneously forfeited for a day period  resulting in a higher level of inventory available for sale beginning inventory plus forfeitures and purchases 
we experienced this doubling of forfeitures as loans in these stores matured in the first two quarters of fiscal in our pawnshops  we acquire inventory for retail sales through pawn loan forfeitures and  to a lesser extent  through purchases of customers merchandise 
the gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on our assessment of the resale value at the time the property is either accepted as loan collateral or purchased 
improper assessment of the resale value in the lending or purchasing process can result in lower margins or reduced marketability of the merchandise 
at september   of our ezmoney stores and of our pawn stores offered credit services to customers seeking loans from unaffiliated lenders 
we do not participate in any of the loans made by the lenders  but earn a fee for helping customers obtain credit and for enhancing customers creditworthiness by providing letters of credit 
we also offer a free service to all credit service customers to improve or establish their credit histories by reporting their payments to an external credit reporting agency 
in connection with our credit services  the unaffiliated lenders offer customers two types of loans 
in all ezmoney stores offering credit services  customers can obtain short term loans  with principal amounts up to  averaging terms of these short term loans are generally less than days  averaging about days  with due dates corresponding with the customers next payday 
we typically earn a fee of of the loan amount for our short term loan credit services 
in ezmoney stores offering credit services  customers can obtain longer term installment loans from the unaffiliated lenders 
the installment loans typically carry terms of about five months with ten equal installment payments due 
table of contents on customers paydays 
installment loan principal amounts range from  to  averaging about  with each installment payment  we earn a fee of of the initial loan amount 
at september   short term loans comprised of the balance of loans brokered through our credit services  and installment loans comprised the remaining 
we earn payday loan fee revenue on our payday loans 
in stores  we make payday loans subject to state law 
the average payday loan amount is approximately and the term is generally less than days  averaging about days 
we typically charge a fee of to of the loan amount for a to day period 
through december  we also marketed and serviced payday loans made by county bank of rehoboth beach in some of our stores 
we could purchase a participation in the county bank loans we marketed 
as of december   county bank discontinued its payday loan program 
most of our stores previously marketing county bank loans now provide credit services to customers in obtaining loans from unaffiliated lenders 
on june   we completed the acquisition of fifteen pawnshops and one payday loan store from jumping jack cash in colorado for million of cash and direct transaction costs 
results of the acquired stores are included in our consolidated results from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price was allocated as presented in note c  acquisitions  in the consolidated financial statements filed with this annual report 
in fiscal  the ezpawn operations segment contributed million greater store operating income compared to the prior year  primarily from an million increase in pawn service charges and a million increase in gross profit on sales  partially offset by higher operating costs 
our ezmoney operations segment contributed million greater store operating income  comprised of higher fees net of bad debt  somewhat offset by higher operating costs primarily at new stores 
after a million increase in administrative expenses and a million increase in depreciation and amortization  operating income increased million to million 
after increases in net interest income and our equity interest in the income of albemarle bond  a million increase in income taxes  and less material changes in other items  our consolidated net income improved to million in the current year from million in the prior year 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  allowance for losses on signature loans  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  observable trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we use this information to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
you should refer to note a of our consolidated financial statements for a more complete review of other accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
pawn loan and sales revenue recognition we record pawn service charges using the interest method for all pawn loans we believe to be collectible 
we base our estimate of collectible loans on several factors  including recent redemption rates  historical trends in redemption rates and the amount of loans due in the following two to three months 
unexpected variations in any of these factors could change our estimate of collectible loans  affecting our earnings and financial condition 
if a pawn loan is not repaid  we value the forfeited collateral inventory at the lower of cost pawn loan principal or 
table of contents market net realizable value of the property 
we record sales revenue and the related cost when this inventory is sold 
credit service revenue recognition we earn credit service fees when we assist customers in obtaining loans from unaffiliated lenders 
we accrue the percentage of credit service fees we expect to collect 
accrued fees related to defaulted loans reduce credit service fee revenue upon loan default  and increase credit service fee revenue upon collection 
credit service revenue is included in signature loan fees on our statements of operations 
credit service bad debt we issue letters of credit to enhance the creditworthiness of our credit service customers seeking loans from unaffiliated lenders 
the letters of credit assure the lenders that if borrowers default on the loans  we will pay the lenders  upon demand  the principal and accrued interest owed it by the borrowers plus any insufficient funds fee 
although amounts paid under letters of credit may be collected later  we charge those amounts to signature loan bad debt upon default 
we record recoveries under the letters of credit as a reduction of bad debt at the time of collection 
after attempting collection of bad debts internally for days  we generally sell them to an unaffiliated company on a weekly basis as another method of recovery 
we account for the sale of defaulted accounts in the same manner as internal collections of defaulted accounts 
the majority of our credit service customers obtain short term loans with a single maturity date 
these short term loans  with maturity dates averaging about days  are considered defaulted if they have not been repaid or renewed by the maturity date 
other credit service customers obtain installment loans with a series of payments due over as much as a five month period 
if one payment of an installment loan is delinquent  that one payment is considered defaulted 
if more than one installment payment is delinquent at any time  the entire loan is considered defaulted 
credit service allowance for losses we also provide an allowance for losses we expect to incur under letters of credit for loans that have not yet matured 
the allowance is based on recent loan default experience adjusted for seasonal variations 
it includes all amounts we expect to pay to the unaffiliated lenders upon loan default  including loan principal  accrued interest and insufficient funds fees  net of the amounts we expect to collect from borrowers expected loc losses 
changes in the allowance are charged to signature loan bad debt expense 
we include the balance of expected loc losses in accounts payable and other accrued expenses on our balance sheet 
at september   the allowance for expected loc losses was million 
at that date  our maximum exposure for losses on letters of credit  if all brokered loans defaulted and none was collected  was million 
this amount includes principal  interest and insufficient funds fees 
based on the expected loss and collection percentages  we also provide an allowance for the credit service fees we expect not to collect  and charge changes in this allowance to signature loan fee revenue 
the accuracy of our allowance estimates is dependent upon several factors  including our ability to predict future default rates based on historical trends and expected future events 
actual loan losses could vary from those estimated due to variance in any of these factors 
increased defaults and credit losses may occur during a national or regional economic downturn  in response to regulatory changes or for other reasons  resulting in the need to increase the allowance 
we believe we effectively manage these risks through our underwriting criteria and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio 
payday loan revenue recognition we accrue fees on the percentage of payday loans we believe to be collectible using the interest method 
accrued fees related to defaulted loans reduce fee revenue upon loan default  and increase fee revenue upon collection 
payday loan fee revenue is included in signature loan fees on our statements of operations 
payday loan bad debt we consider a loan defaulted if it has not been repaid or renewed by the maturity date 
although defaulted loans may be collected later  we charge the loan principal to signature loan bad debt upon default  leaving only active loans in the reported balance 
we record collections of principal as a reduction of signature loan bad debt when collected 
after attempting collection of bad debts internally for days  we generally sell them to an unaffiliated company on a weekly basis as 
table of contents another method of recovery 
we account for the sale of defaulted loans in the same manner as internal collections of defaulted loans 
payday loan allowance for losses we provide an allowance for losses on payday loans that have not yet matured and related fees receivable  based on recent loan default experience adjusted for seasonal variations 
we charge any changes in the principal valuation allowance to signature loan bad debt 
we record changes in the fee receivable valuation allowance to signature loan fee revenue 
at september   the combined allowances for uncollectible principal and interest on payday loans were million 
inventory if a pawn loan is not redeemed  we record the forfeited collateral at cost 
we do not record loan loss allowances or charge offs on the principal portion of pawn loans  as they are fully collateralized 
in order to state inventory at the lower of cost specific identification or market net realizable value  we record an allowance for shrinkage and excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory 
the allowance is based on the type and age of merchandise and recent sales trends and margins 
at september   the inventory valuation allowance was million  or of gross inventory 
we record changes in the inventory valuation allowance as cost of goods sold 
the accuracy of our inventory allowance is dependent on our ability to predict future events based on historical trends 
unexpected variations in sales margins  inventory turnover  or other factors  including fluctuations in gold values could increase or decrease our inventory allowance 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this involves estimating the actual current tax liability and assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that we include in our balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we determined we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to the income tax provision in that period 
likewise  if we determined we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  a decrease to the valuation allowance would decrease the tax provision in that period 
we assess the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance quarterly 
our valuation allowance was million at september  share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we estimate the grant date fair value of options using the black scholes merton option pricing model and amortize that fair value to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the options vesting periods 
certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
off balance sheet arrangements we issue letters of credit to enhance the creditworthiness of our credit service customers seeking loans from unaffiliated lenders 
the letters of credit assure the lenders that if borrowers default on the loans  we will pay the lenders  upon demand  the principal and accrued interest owed it by the borrowers plus any insufficient funds fee 
we do not record on our balance sheet the loans related to our credit services as the loans are made by unaffiliated lenders 
we do not consolidate the unaffiliated lender s results with our results as we do not have any ownership interest in the lenders  do not exercise control over them and do not otherwise meet the criteria for consolidation as prescribed by fasb financial interpretation no 
regarding variable interest entities 
we include an allowance for expected loc losses in accounts payable and other accrued expenses on our balance sheet 
at september   the allowance for expected loc losses was million 
at that date  our maximum exposure for losses on letters of credit  if all brokered loans defaulted and none was collected  was million 
this amount includes principal  interest and insufficient funds fees 

table of contents we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of adopting a new accounting principle for share based compensation prior to october   we accounted for our share based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
for periods prior to october   share based employee compensation cost was recognized in the statement of operations for only restricted stock grants and options granted at prices below market price on the date of grant 
effective october   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method  as more fully described in note i of the financial statements included in this report 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition provisions  we have not restated results for prior periods 
our net income includes the following compensation costs related to our share based compensation arrangements years ended september  in thousands gross compensation costs stock options restricted stock total gross compensation costs income tax benefits stock options restricted stock total income tax benefits net compensation expense at september   the unamortized fair value of share based awards to be amortized over their remaining vesting periods was approximately million 
these costs will be amortized over a weighted average period of years

our current year pawn service charge revenue increased  or million from the prior year to million 
this was due to a four percentage point increase in loan yields to  coupled with a higher average pawn loan balance 
same store pawn service charges increased from the prior year  with the remaining increase coming from new stores 
in the last two years  we have periodically raised our loan values on gold jewelry in response to increases in gold market values and similar changes by our competitors 
this contributed about million to the increase in pawn service charges in the current year 
the higher yield resulted largely from the fiscal mid year conversion of most of our pawn stores from offering day loan terms to offering day terms 

table of contents in the current year  million of recorded pawn service charge revenue was collected in cash  and million was due to an increase in pawn service charges receivable related to the larger ending portfolio in the current year 
in the prior year  million of recorded pawn service charge revenue was collected in cash  offset by a million decrease in pawn service charges receivable 
the decrease in the prior year accrual was primarily due to shortening the loan term in most of our pawn stores in that period 
the accrual of pawn service charges is dependent on the size of the loan portfolio  the loan term and our estimate of collectible loans in the portfolio at the end of each period

this was due to a million  or increase in same store merchandise sales and a million increase in new store sales  reduced by a percentage point decrease in gross margins 
in the prior year  we benefited from the doubling of loan forfeitures due to the reduction of loan terms in the majority of our stores 
this provided a greater amount of fresh inventory in the second and third quarters of fiscal to fuel sales at a better margin 
more aggressive discounting of electronics and jewelry and increased jewelry loan values in response to market increases in gold values also led to lower margins in the current year 
the gross profit on jewelry scrapping sales increased million from the prior year to million 
this was due to an million  or increase in jewelry scrapping sales on more volume  and a percentage point decrease in margins 
the jewelry scrapping sales include the current year sale of approximately million of loose diamonds removed from scrapped jewelry  compared to approximately million in fiscal the proceeds refiners pay us for jewelry has increased in the last year in response to higher gold values 
we also increased the amount we loan on jewelry and pay to purchase jewelry from customers  increasing the cost of these items
