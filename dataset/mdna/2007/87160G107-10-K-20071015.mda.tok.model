our business the company designs  manufacturers and markets medical devices for use in ophthalmic and vitreoretinal surgery and neurosurgery 
its products are designed and manufactured to support micro or minimally invasive surgical procedures 
in addition to such surgical devices and equipment  we also design and manufacture disposable and non disposable supplies and accessories for use with such devices and equipment 
for a more detailed description  see item business overview 
we sell our products primarily to hospitals  clinics and surgeons in approximately countries 
sales outside the united states are primarily through local distributors 
as used in this discussion  the company or synergetics usa means the company and its subsidiaries 
new product sales the company s business strategy has been  and is expected to continue to be  the development and marketing of new technologies for the ophthalmic surgery  neurosurgery markets and ent 
new products  which management defines as products first available for sale within the prior month period  accounted for approximately of total sales for the company for fiscal  or approximately million 
for fiscal  new products accounted for approximately of total sales for the company  or approximately million 
this growth was primarily in our capital equipment products both in the ophthalmic and neurosurgery markets 
synergetics past revenue growth has been closely aligned with the adoption by surgeons of new technologies introduced by synergetics 
since august   synergetics has introduced new catalogue items to the ophthalmic and neurosurgery markets 
we expect adoption rates for the company s new products in the future to have a similar effect on its operating performance 
growth in minimally invasive surgery procedures minimally invasive surgery is surgery performed without making a major incision or opening 
minimally invasive surgery generally results in less patient trauma  less likelihood of complications related to the incision and a shorter recovery time 
a growing number of surgical procedures are performed using minimally invasive techniques  creating a multi million dollar market for the specialized devices used in the procedures 
the company has benefited from the overall growth in this market and expects to continue to benefit as it continues to introduce new and improved technologies targeting this market  such as its and gauge instrumentation and photon tm ii gas arc light source for the ophthalmic surgical market and our new electrosurgical generator  the malis advantage tm 
demand trends volume and mix improvements contributed to the majority of sales growth for the company during the fiscal years ended july   and ophthalmic and neurosurgical procedures volume on a global basis continues to rise at an estimated growth rate driven by an aging global population  new technologies  advances in surgical techniques and a growing global market resulting from ongoing improvements in healthcare delivery in third world countries  among other factors 
in addition  the demand for high quality products and new technologies  such as the company s innovative instruments and disposables  to support growth in procedures volume continues to positively impact growth 
the company believes innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly impact the ophthalmic and neurosurgery market 

table of contents pricing trends through its strategy of delivering new and higher quality technologies  the company has generally been able to maintain the average selling prices for its products in the face of downward pressure in the healthcare industry 
however  competition in the markets for our electrosurgical generators and ultrasonic aspirators has negatively impacted the company s selling prices on these medical devices 
our business strategy our goal is to become a global leader in the development  manufacture and marketing of precision engineered  microsurgical instruments  capital equipment and devices for use in ophthalmic surgery and neurosurgical applications and to grow our product lines in other specialty surgical markets 
our strategy includes introducing new technology that easily differentiates our products from our competition by capitalizing on our combined successes in delivering minimally invasive products that enable concentrated application to a surgical area with decreased impact beyond the specific desired surgical effects  resulting in improved recovery times and shorter hospital stays  identifying microsurgical niches that may offer the prospect for substantial growth and higher profit margins that allow us an opportunity to build upon our existing technologies  such as expanding the use of our products in ent  spine surgery  plastic surgery and other forms of microsurgery  accelerating our international growth by continuing to build on our recent successes supported by valley forge s long established relationships and reputation in global markets  utilizing the full breadth and depth of knowledge  experience and resources of our research and development department to deliver precision engineered capital equipment  instruments  acessories and disposables based on our own proprietary technologies and innovations  branding and marketing a substantial portion of our neurosurgical and ent products with the malis trademark  continuing to develop our distribution channels  including the expansion of our domestic ophthalmic  neurosurgical and ent sales forces  development of an international direct ophthalmic sales force and continued expansion of our international neurosurgical distributor relationships to assure that our products and their associated benefits are seen by those making or influencing the purchasing decisions  continuing to grow our disposables revenue stream across our product lines by focusing on the development of a full offering of disposable adjuncts  such as instruments  adapters and fiber optics  to our capital equipment offerings and emphasizing disposables designed to eliminate hospital repair costs and minimize patient to patient disease transfer  expanding the photon tm product line into other surgical markets such as neurosurgery  ent and general surgery markets  
table of contents continuing the penetration of the malis advantage tm  our newest multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical generator  into the neurosurgery market  developing the malis advantage tm applications with our new proprietary single use  hand switching bipolar instruments with enhanced features and functionality further into the neurosurgical market and into other surgical markets such as spine  ent and plastic markets  expanding the use of the malis advantage tm into other surgical markets as its increased power and functionality allows the surgeon to perform functions similar to traditional monopolar systems  without the inherent safety limitations  expanding the use of the omni  our ultrasonic aspirator  into other surgical markets such as spine and the ent markets as its torsional bone cutting capability allows the surgeon to perform delicate procedures safely  exploring opportunities for growth through strategic partnering with other companies  such as our current relationships with codman  and exploring opportunities for growth through strategic  accretive mergers or acquisitions which would further expand our product offerings  distribution channels or research and development capabilities

revenue recognition the company records revenue from product sales when the revenue is realized and the product is shipped from its facilities 
this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident  usually through receipt of a purchase order  the sales price is fixed and determinable  delivery to the carrier has occurred  and collectibility is reasonably ensured 
freight and shipping billed to customers is included in net sales  and the cost of shipping is included in cost of sales 
service revenue substantially relates to repairs of products and is recognized when the service has been completed 
revenue from licenses  extended warranty contracts and royalty fees is recorded when earned 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
the company s inventory is very dynamic and new products are added frequently 
thus  the company reviews the valuation of its inventory on a quarterly basis and determines if a valuation allowance is necessary for items that have not been valued or for items that have not had their values updated recently 
in addition  the company evaluates inventories for excess quantities and identified obsolescence quarterly 
its evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand  as well as estimates of quantities required to support warranty and other repairs 
to the extent that it determines there are some excess quantities based on its projected levels of sales and other requirements  or obsolete material in inventory  it records valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related parts or products 
if future cost valuations  future demand or market conditions are different from the company s projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 

table of contents amortization periods the company records amortization of intangible assets using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets 
it bases the determination of these useful lives on the period over which it expects the related assets to contribute to its cash flows or in the case of patents  their legal life  whichever is shorter 
if the company s assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  it may change future amortization expense see impairment of long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to the company  the company records an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that management reasonably expects to collect 
for all other customers  the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment  its historical experience and credit insurance 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  the company may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 
patents and research and development incremental legal and other costs to obtain the patent are capitalized to a patent asset 
salaries  benefits and other direct costs of product development are expensed as operating expenses in research and development costs 
patents are amortized to operations under the straight line method over the remaining statutory life of the patent 
goodwill and other intangibles absent any impairment indicators  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis 
the company has performed its impairment tests during the fourth fiscal quarter 
management analyzed the valuation of our valley forge acquisition by utilizing current business operations and a market multiple method 
based on this analysis  we believe the enterprise value of our acquisition continues to be greater than our investment 
as a result  we have determined that no impairment of our goodwill has occurred 
while the annual impairment tests did not indicate goodwill impairment  we would be subject to future impairment if the operating results and cash flows of our valley forge acquisition would not support the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets including goodwill 
intangibles assets  consisting of patents  licensing agreements and proprietary know how are amortized to operations under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives or statutory lives whichever is shorter 
these periods range from two to ten years 
the life of a trademark is inextricably related to the life of the product bearing the mark or the life of the business entity owning the trademark 
the company intends to use the trademark indefinitely  and therefore  its useful life is not limited to any specific product 
the trademark constitutes an indefinite lived intangible that will be used in perpetuity 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the group of assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
deferred tax assets and liabilities the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when a determination is made that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized

the company has utilized in this calculation 
the company has elected to use the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  an entity uses the fair value based accounting method for all employee awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date 
as of the effective date  compensation costs related to the nonvested portion of awards outstanding as of that date are based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under the original provisions of sfas no
