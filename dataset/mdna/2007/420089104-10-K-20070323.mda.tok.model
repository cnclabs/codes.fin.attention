item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included in part ii  item of this form k 
management s discussion and analysis may contain forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  this performance involves risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
some of the important factors that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ from those discussed are listed under item a  risk factors 
results of operations through our subsidiaries  we operate in two reportable segments friction products and performance racing 
our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including but not limited to  general customer demand for our products  competition  raw material pricing and availability  labor relations with our personnel  political conditions in the countries in which we operate and general economic conditions 
we sell a wide range of products that have a corresponding range of gross margins 
our consolidated gross margin is affected by product mix  selling prices  material and labor costs as well as our ability to absorb overhead costs resulting from fluctuations in demand for our products 
in the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell our precision components segment to focus our corporate resources on the friction products and performance racing segments 
the precision components segment manufactured powder metal component parts and had operations in the united states and china 
on february  we completed the sale of this segment for approximately million consisting of million in cash and the assumption by the purchaser of million in debt 
the cash portion of the purchase price includes proceeds from a preliminary working capital adjustment which remains subject to further adjustment by the parties 
we restated our results of operations for this segment to reclassify its net operations  assets and liabilities as discontinued for all periods presented in this report and their results are not included in this discussion of our results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell our motor segment  with operations in monterrey  mexico and alton  illinois 
this segment  which manufactures die cast aluminum rotors for fractional and subfractional horsepower electric motors  failed to achieve a certain level of profitability and  after completing an extensive analysis  we determined that a divestiture of this segment would allow us to concentrate on our major lines of business 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold certain fixed assets of our alton  illinois facility  which had been previously adjusted to their fair market value as of december  in addition  we sold the land and building of this facility  and recognized a million million  net of tax fair market value adjustment loss in the results of discontinued operations 
on march  we entered into an agreement to sell the monterrey  mexico operations 
the transaction was finalized in the fourth quarter of as a result  there are no remaining assets or liabilities of the motor segment classified as discontinued operations in the december  balance sheet 
also in the fourth quarter of  we committed to a restructuring program to achieve cost savings in our friction products segment by moving operations at our brook park  ohio location to a new production facility in tulsa  oklahoma 
manufacturing in the oklahoma facility began in late and the facility became operational in additionally  we completed the closure of our brook park  ohio operation during the fourth quarter of in connection with the closure of the ohio facility  we reported pre tax restructuring costs of million million is included in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  related to relocation and employee severance expenses 
in  our income from operations increased million to million  or  from the prior year 
this increase in operating income was primarily the result of pricing actions taken during the last half of  product mix and operating improvements at the company s tulsa facility compared to our operating income was negatively affected by a million non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of by our performance racing segment 
non gaap financial measure in our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations  we may refer to financial measures which are considered to be non gaap financial measures under the rules and regulations of the sec 
the non gaap financial measure used by us is adjusted income from operations 
this measure is reconciled to the most comparable gaap financial measure in tables presented in this section of this form k 
this non gaap financial measure is defined by us as income from operations as presented in our consolidated statements of operations plus a goodwill impairment charge  restructuring and loan forgiveness costs  less income from a reversal of a post retirement benefit liability 
we use this measure to more accurately gauge the ongoing day to day operating activities of our business 
in the fourth quarter of  based on an independent assessment of our performance racing segment and its present and future operations  we recognized a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million 
as a result of our decision to relocate one of our friction products manufacturing facilities to tulsa  oklahoma from ohio  we incurred significant restructuring costs related to this event that impacted our financial results for this restructuring program was completed as of december  the loan forgiveness expense resulted from a one time  non recurring action taken by our compensation committee on january  approving the forgiveness of the shareholder notes of two of our senior executive officers 
the action required the full forgiveness of the shareholder notes by july  if specific operating targets were met 
based on our performance  the remaining outstanding loan balance was forgiven in march additionally  we reported income in the third quarter of as a result of a reduction in an actuarially computed post retirement benefit liability no longer owed by us 
there were no comparable restructuring costs  loan forgiveness costs  or other non cash income relating to the reversal of a pension liability during we have presented this non gaap financial measure because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of isolated factors underlying that performance 
in addition  our chief operating decision makers use this measure in monitoring and evaluating both our overall performance and the ongoing performance of each of our business segments 
this non gaap financial measure should not be considered an alternative to measures required by gaap 
outlook for based on our current view of the markets we serve  and new business awarded by customers during  we believe that our net sales will increase between and to between million and million compared to net sales of million 
we expect that we will continue to see strength through in the majority of our end markets including  construction and mining  aerospace and specialty friction 
however  this strength will be partially offset by the expected slowdown in our heavy truck market as a result of the market strength in advance of the implementation of new truck emission standards 
furthermore  we expect that our net sales will be positively impacted by new business awards in both the friction products and performance racing segments  increased sales in the friction products segment s direct aftermarket and continued strong performance from our international operations 
we expect our income from operations  which for is the same as adjusted income from operations  to increase to a range of million and million from adjusted income from operations of million reported for the full year our adjusted income from operations in excludes goodwill impairment charges of million related to the impairment of goodwill in our performance racing segment 
given the numerous potential applications of the net cash generated by the sale of our precision components segment  which include the stock repurchase program  reduction of our senior notes  acquisitions and the resulting impact that all or some of these actions might have on our results  we will not be providing guidance on earnings per share for the year 
critical accounting policies some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by us in the preparation of our financial statements 
in applying these policies  we use our best judgment to determine the underlying assumptions that are used in calculating the estimates that affect the reported values on our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we consider relevant 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
however  historically our estimates have not been materially different from actual results 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when products are shipped and title has transferred to our customer 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of companies we acquired over the fair value of their net assets as of the date of acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  our policy is to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually  or more frequently if there is a significant adverse event or change in the environment in which one of our business unit operates 
we will record any impairment loss identified in the period such determination is made 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future discounted cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on our experience and knowledge of operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation and competitive trends 
if actual results are materially different than the assumptions used  impairment could result 
we recorded an impairment charge of million for the period ended december  as of december   we have no remaining goodwill in our continuing operations on our consolidated balance sheet 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets excluding goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on our experience and knowledge of our operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation and competitive trends 
if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we did not record any impairment charges to our tangible or indefinite lived intangible assets in the periods ended december    or pension benefits 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the most significant elements in determining our pension income expense in accordance with sfas are the expected return on plan assets and appropriate discount rates 
we assumed that the expected weighted average long term rate of return on plan assets would be for based on our existing and forecasted asset allocation and related long term investment performance results  we believe that our assumption of future returns is reasonable 
however  should the rate of return differ materially from our assumed rate we could experience a material adverse effect on the funded status of our plans and our future pension expense 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income expense 
net periodic benefit cost was million for the period ended december  and million for the period ended december  see note employee benefits in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of this form k for details regarding the action taken on one of our defined benefit plans as of may  we determine the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities at their measurement date  december the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
at december   we determined this rate to be 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income expense  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  has been deferred as permitted by sfas income taxes 
our effective tax rate  taxes payable and other tax assets and liabilities reflect the current tax rates in the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for reporting and income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate is substantially driven by the impact of the mix of our foreign and domestic income and losses and the federal and local tax rate differences on each 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  provides certain guidelines to follow in making the determination of the need for a valuation allowance 
we must demonstrate that taxable income is expected to be available for future periods sufficient to realize the benefits of temporary differences and carryforwards to avoid recording a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
we have announced the sale of the powdered metal segment which along with the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities will more likely than not enable the company to realize the aforementioned tax benefits  and therefore  we have determined that no valuation allowance is necessary as of december on january   the fasb affirmed its previous decision to make fin effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  fin is effective for hawk corporation and its subsidiaries for the year beginning january  we do not expect the interpretation to have a material impact on our results from operations of financial position 
foreign currency translation and transactions 
assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated using period end exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates as determined throughout the year 
gains or losses resulting from translation are included in a separate component of our shareholders equity 
other comprehensive income includes a translation gain of million for the year ended december  gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are translated to local currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
sales or purchases in foreign currencies  other than the subsidiary s local currency  are exchanged at the date of the transaction 
the effect of transaction gains or losses is included in other expense income  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the results of operations in and recent accounting developments

section of the sarbanes oxley act of section contains provisions requiring an annual assessment by management  as of the end of the fiscal year  of the effectiveness of internal control for financial reporting 
section also requires attestation and reporting by independent auditors on management s assessment as well as other control related matters 
on september   the sec published a ruling extending for one year the compliance dates for non accelerated filers to report on internal control over financial reporting 
for these issuers  including the company  section will be effective for fiscal years ending on or after july  on august   the sec published a new rule that would extend the compliance date for the report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting until fiscal years ending on or after december  for non accelerated filers 
the rule would also extend the non accelerated filer compliance date for the auditor attestation report on internal control over financial reporting until fiscal years ending on or after december  at this time  we continue to qualify for non accelerated filer status and therefore  will not need to comply with section until december  our compliance initiatives are proceeding 
we anticipate being compliant with the requirements of section as of december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  our continuing operations are organized into two strategic segments 
these segments include friction products and performance racing 
in the third quarter of we committed to selling our precision components segment 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of we committed to selling our motor segment 
as a result  we have classified these business segments as discontinued operations in our financial results 
net sales 
our consolidated net sales in were million  an increase of million or from the same period in we experienced sales increases in our friction products segment  primarily as a result of pricing actions  continued new product introductions  strong economic conditions in our end markets and market share gains during the year

our sales to the truck market increased by in compared to as our customers supported the continued growth in new truck builds and aftermarket service requirements to existing truck fleets during the year as well

these measures were taken to meet increased competition in the transmission market 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million to million during  a increase compared to gross profit of million in our gross profit margin improved to of our net sales in compared to of our net sales in the increase is primarily the result of pricing actions taken in the last half of  operating improvements in the last half of at our friction products facility in tulsa and margin improvement from volume related absorption of fixed overhead

capitalization is defined as debt plus shareholders equity 
as part of our working capital management program  we review certain working capital measures on a continuous basis 
the million increase in our net working capital from december  resulted primarily from the classification of all discontinued operations assets and liabilities as current in the balance sheet due to its anticipated disposition within months as comparied to presenting current and long term assets and liabilities of discontinue operations in the balance sheet 
in addition  we experienced increased receivables and inventory levels to support our increased sales volumes during the period 
our accounts receivable and inventory levels are reviewed through the computation of days sales outstanding and inventory turnover  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable at december  was days compared to days at december  the increase is mainly attributable to the sales increases during recent months in addition to a reduction of a receivable factoring program at our italian facility during average inventory days decreased to days at december  as compared to days at december  our overall inventory investment has increased approximately million at december  as compared to december  levels  primarily to support our increased sales volumes during the recent period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in seeking to minimize the risks and costs associated with market risk  we manage our exposures to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financial activities and through foreign currency hedge contracts 
we had no foreign currency hedge contracts outstanding as of december  we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
at december   approximately  or million  of our total outstanding debt bore interest at a variable rate 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from floating rate debt 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from december  rates  and assuming no changes in debt from december  levels  our additional annual interest expense would be less than million 
the interest rates on our long term debt reflect market rates and therefore  the carrying value of long term debt approximates fair value 
an analysis of our obligations is further discussed in note financing arrangements and note lease obligations in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the following table presents our total contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  dollars in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations short term debt bank facility senior notes capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations other commercial commitments stand by letters of credit this contractual obligation table does not include our defined benefit pension obligations 
an analysis of our obligations under our defined benefit plans is contained in note employee benefits in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of this form k 
variable rate obligations the senior notes due november   accrue interest at a fixed rate of per annum or million per year 
purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for inventory purchases  services and capital expenditures under purchase order 
inflation risk 
we manage our inflation risks by ongoing review of product selling prices and production costs 
in spite of the recent surcharges and prices increases on a number of our raw materials  we historically have been able to pass these increased costs to our customers  though we do experience a delay between our cost increases and sales price increases 
currently  we do not believe that inflation risks are material to our business  its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the majority of our receipts and expenditures are contracted in us dollars  and we do not consider the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange to be material at this time 
we have operations outside the united states with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily denominated in euros  canadian dollars  and chinese yuan 
because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  financial exposure may result  primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates 
we do not expect that our unhedged foreign currency balance sheet exposure as of december  will result in a significant impact on our earnings or cash flows 
we also monitor exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each country in which hawk operates  and have periodically entered into forward contracts to mitigate that exposure 
as of december   we have no derivative instruments outstanding
