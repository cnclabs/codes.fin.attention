item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item  note significant accounting policies and note segment information for financial and other information concerning our business segments and geographic areas 
our executive corporate headquarters is located at theodore fremd avenue  rye  ny  and our telephone number is item a 
risk factors the ownership of our common stock involves a number of risks and uncertainties 
potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this form k and annual report before deciding whether to invest in our securities 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to our business our sales are highly dependent on purchases from several large customers and any significant decline in these purchases or pressure from these customers to reduce prices could have a negative effect on our future financial performance 
due to consolidation in the us retail industry  our customer base has become relatively concentrated 
in  one customer accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 

table of contents although we have long established relationships with many of our customers  we do not have any long term supply or binding contracts or guarantees of minimum purchases 
purchases by our customers are generally made using individual purchase orders 
as a result  these customers may cancel their orders  change purchase quantities from forecast volumes  or delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond our control 
significant or numerous cancellations  reductions  or delays in purchases by customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  because many of our costs are fixed  a reduction in customer demand could have an adverse effect on our gross profit margins and operating income 
we depend on a continuous flow of new orders from our large  high volume retail customers  however  we may be unable to continually meet the needs of our customers 
furthermore  on time delivery and satisfactory customer service are becoming increasingly important to our customers 
retailers are increasing their demands on suppliers to reduce lead times for product delivery  which may require us to increase inventories and could impact the timing of reported sales  improve customer service  such as with direct import programs  whereby product is supplied directly to retailers from third party suppliers  and adopt new technologies related to inventory management such as radio frequency identification  otherwise known as rfid  technology  which may have substantial implementation costs 
we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to successfully meet the needs of our customers 
a substantial decrease in sales to any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
seasonality and weather conditions may cause our operating results to vary from quarter to quarter 
sales of certain of our products are seasonal 
sales of our outdoor solutions products increase during warm weather months and decrease during winter 
additionally  sales of our home canning products generally reflect the pattern of the growing season  sales of our home improvement products are concentrated in the spring and summer months  sales of our firelogs and firestarters are concentrated in the fall and winter months and sales of our consumer solutions products generally are strongest in the fourth quarter preceding the holiday season 
weather conditions may also negatively impact sales 
for instance  we may not sell as many of certain outdoor recreation products such as lanterns  tents and sleeping bags as anticipated if there are fewer natural disasters such as hurricanes and ice storms  mild winter weather may negatively impact sales of electric blankets  heaters  firelogs and firestarters  some health products and smoke or carbon monoxide alarms  and the late arrival of summer weather may negatively impact sales of outdoor camping equipment and grills 
additionally  sales of our home canning products and our home improvement products may be negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions and other market trends 
periods of drought  for example  could adversely affect the supply and price of fruit  vegetables and other foods available for home canning  and inclement weather may reduce the amount of time spent on home improvement projects 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operations are dependent upon third party suppliers whose failure to perform adequately could disrupt our business operations 
we currently source a significant portion of parts and products from third parties 
our ability to select and retain reliable vendors who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact our success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products 
we typically do not enter into long term contracts with our primary vendors and suppliers 
instead  most parts and products are supplied on a purchase order basis 
as a result  we may be subject to unexpected changes in pricing or supply of products 
any inability of our suppliers to timely deliver quality parts and products or any unanticipated change in supply  quality or pricing of products could be disruptive and costly to us 

table of contents our reliance on manufacturing facilities and suppliers in asia could make us vulnerable to supply interruptions related to the political  legal and cultural environment in asia 
a significant portion of our products are manufactured by third party suppliers in asia  primarily the people s republic of china  or at our owned facility in southern china 
our ability to continue to select reliable vendors who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact our success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products 
furthermore  the ability of our owned facility to timely deliver finished goods  and the ability of third party suppliers to timely deliver finished goods and or raw materials  may be affected by events beyond their control  such as inability of shippers to timely deliver merchandise due to work stoppages or slowdowns  or significant weather and health conditions such as sars affecting manufacturers and or shippers 
any adverse change in  among other things  any of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition our relationship with third party suppliers  the financial condition of third party suppliers  our ability to import products from these third party suppliers or our owned facility  or third party suppliers ability to manufacture and deliver outsourced products on a timely basis 
we cannot assure you that we could quickly or effectively replace any of our suppliers if the need arose  and we cannot assure you that we could retrieve tooling and molds possessed by any of our third party suppliers 
our dependence on these few suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to react quickly and effectively to changes in the market for our products 
in addition  international manufacturing is subject to significant risks  including  among other things labor unrest  political instability  restrictions on transfer of funds  domestic and international customs and tariffs  unexpected changes in regulatory environments  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
labor in china has historically been readily available at relatively low cost as compared to labor costs in north america 
china has experienced rapid social  political and economic change in recent years 
we cannot assure you that labor will continue to be available to us in china at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on our operations in china 
a substantial increase in labor costs in china could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although china currently enjoys most favored nation trading status with the united states  the us government has in the past proposed to revoke such status and to impose higher tariffs on products imported from china 
we cannot assure you that our business will not be affected by the aforementioned risks  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results can be adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials 
pricing and availability of raw materials for use in our businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control  including general  domestic and international economic conditions  labor costs  production levels  competition  consumer demand  import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates 
this volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for us  and may  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents during periods of rising prices of raw materials  there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers 
conversely  when raw material prices decline  customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and  to the extent we have existing inventory  lower margins 
as a result  fluctuations in raw material prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
some of the products we manufacture require particular types of glass  paper  plastic  metal  wax  wood or other materials 
supply shortages for a particular type of material can delay production or cause increases in the cost of manufacturing our products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  we rely on wax for certain products in our branded consumables segment and resin for many of the products in our consumer solutions and outdoor solutions business segments and the plastics solutions part of our process solutions business segment 
wax and resin prices have risen in response to  among other things  higher oil prices 
if wax prices  resin prices or other material prices rise further in the future we can expect the cost of goods for our businesses to increase 
given that only some of this increase relates to contracts where we have pass through pricing  the effect of the remainder of the increase could have a material adverse effect on our margins 
we also rely on glass for certain of the products in our branded consumables business segment 
glass prices have risen in response to higher natural gas prices 
if glass prices rise further in the future  we can expect the cost of goods to increase  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
with the growing trend towards consolidation among suppliers of many of our raw materials  especially resin  glass and steel  we are increasingly dependent upon key suppliers whose bargaining strength is growing 
in addition  many of those suppliers have been reducing production capacity of those raw materials in the north american market 
we may be negatively affected by changes in availability and price of raw materials resulting from this consolidation and reduced capacity  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we are subject to several production related risks which could jeopardize our ability to realize anticipated sales and profits 
in order to realize sales and operating profits at anticipated levels  we must manufacture or source and deliver in a timely manner products of high quality 
among others  the following factors can have a negative effect on our ability to do these things labor difficulties  scheduling and transportation difficulties  management dislocation  substandard product quality  which can result in higher warranty  product liability and product recall costs  delays in development of quality new products  changes in laws and regulations  including changes in tax rates  accounting standards  and environmental and occupational laws  health and safety laws  and changes in the availability and costs of labor 
any adverse change in the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because we manufacture or source a significant portion of our products from asia  our production lead times are relatively long 
therefore  we often commit to production in advance of firm customer orders 
if we fail to forecast customer or consumer demand accurately we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or 
table of contents in liquidating excess inventories  or may find that customers are canceling orders or returning products 
additionally  changes in retailer inventory management strategies could make inventory management more difficult 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy  achieve profitability  or maintain relationships with existing customers 
we operate in some highly competitive industries 
in these industries  we compete against numerous other domestic and foreign companies 
competition in the markets in which we operate is based primarily on product quality  product innovation  price and customer service and support  although the degree and nature of such competition vary by location and product line 
in our branded consumables segment  we have direct competitors in most of our niche markets 
in addition  in the market for home canning  we compete with companies who specialize in other food preservation mediums  such as freezing and dehydration 
the market for plastic cutlery is extremely price sensitive and our competitors include far east and domestic suppliers 
our competition in the market for rope  cord and twine includes mibro and private label brands 
our key competitors in the home safety business include kidde  invensys and universal security instruments inc in the market for playing cards  our competition includes angel  cardinal carta mundi  copag  gaming partners international  gemaco  patch products and a number of other manufacturers located in china 
in our consumer solutions segment  our foodsaver and seal a meal appliances and bags compete with marketers of conventional food storage solutions  such as non vacuum plastic bags and containers 
in addition  our competitors include other manufacturers of home sealing appliances that heat or vacuum seal bags 
as household penetration of home vacuum packaging systems has increased  more competitors have entered the market 
as such  the market has become more price and feature sensitive 
there are also several companies that manufacture industrial and commercial vacuum packaging products 
in more mature small household appliance categories outside of home vacuum packaging  including blenders  toasters and irons  among others  our key competitors in the united states and canada include applica incorporated  cuisinart  kitchen aid  nacco and salton  inc in heated bedding products  our primary competitor is microlife biddeford 
in scales  our key competitors include homedics metro taylor and private label brands 
our key competitors for clippers  trimmers and accessories for professional users include andis  wahl and conair 
our primary competitor to our hospitality business is proctor silex 
in portable air cleaning products  our primary competitors are delonghi  honeywell kaz  hunter  ionic breeze and ionic pro llc 
in vaporizers and humidifiers  our key competitors are honeywell kaz  hunter and lasko 
our key competitors in portable heaters are honeywell kaz  lakewood  lasko and soleus 
our primary competitors in fans are honeywell kaz  hunter  king of fans and lasko 
in the outdoor solutions segment  our largest competitors include igloo corporation  intex corporation  vf corporation  johnson outdoors  kellwood company and rubbermaid 
we also face competition from the manufacturing operations of some of our current and potential customers with private label brands 
some of our competitors are more established in their industries and have substantially greater revenue or resources than we do 
our competitors may take actions to match new product introductions and other initiatives 
since many of our competitors source their products from third parties  our ability to obtain a cost advantage through sourcing is reduced 
certain of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with us 
further  retailers often demand that suppliers reduce their prices on existing products 
competition could cause price reductions  reduced profits or losses or loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents to compete effectively in the future in the consumer products industry  among other things  we must maintain strict quality standards  develop new products that appeal to consumers  and deliver products on a reliable basis at competitive prices 
our inability to do any of these things could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to develop new or expand existing customer relationships  our ability to grow our business will be impaired 
our growth depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop new customer relationships and to expand existing relationships with current customers 
we cannot guarantee that new customers will be found  that any such new relationships will be successful when they are in place  or that business with current customers will increase 
failure to develop and expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we cannot continue to develop new products in a timely manner  and at favorable margins  we may not be able to compete effectively 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to continue to introduce innovative design extensions for our existing products and to develop  manufacture and market new products 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the introduction  manufacturing and marketing of any new products or product innovations  or develop and introduce  in a timely manner  innovations to our existing products that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
our failure to develop new products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner  and at favorable margins  would harm our ability to successfully grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to risks related to acquisitions  and our failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have achieved growth through the acquisition of companies  including the acquisitions of ahi and holmes  and tuck in acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully these businesses or future acquisitions into our existing business without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial difficulties 
there is also no assurance that we will be able to successfully leverage synergies among our businesses to increase sales and obtain cost savings 
additionally  the failure of these businesses to achieve expected results  diversion of our management s attention and failure to retain key personnel at these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions we pursue as part of our business strategy may be financed through a combination of cash on hand  operating cash flow  availability under our senior credit facility and new capital market offerings 
if new debt is added to current debt levels  or if we incur other liabilities  including contingent liabilities  in connection with an acquisition  the debt or liabilities could impose additional constraints and requirements on our business and financial performance  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
our results could be adversely affected if the cost of compliance with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations becomes too burdensome 
our operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations including those that impose workplace standards and regulate the discharge of pollutants into the 
table of contents environment and establish standards for the handling  generation  emission  release  discharge  treatment  storage and disposal of materials and substances including solid and hazardous wastes 
we believe that we are in material compliance with such laws and regulations and that the cost of maintaining compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
however  due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology  we cannot assure you that future material capital expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
in january  the european union eu issued two directives relating to chemical substances in electronic products 
the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive requires producers of electrical goods to pay for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
eu governments were required to enact and implement legislation that complies with this directive by august  such legislation  together with the directive  the weee legislation  and certain producers are to be financially responsible under the weee legislation beginning in august the eu has issued another directive that requires electrical and electronic equipment placed on the eu market after july  to be free of lead  mercury  cadmium  hexavalent chromium above a threshold limit and brominated flame retardants 
eu governments were required to enact and implement legislation that complies with this directive by august  such legislation  together with this directive  the rohs legislation 
if we do not comply with these directives  we may suffer a loss of revenue  be unable to sell in certain markets and or countries  be subject to penalties and enforced fees and or suffer a competitive disadvantage 
similar legislation could be enacted in other jurisdictions  including in the united states 
costs to comply with the weee legislation  rohs legislation and or similar future legislation  if applicable  could include costs associated with modifying our products  recycling and other waste processing costs  legal and regulatory costs and insurance costs 
we may also be required to take reserves for costs associated with compliance with these regulations 
we cannot assure you that the costs to comply with these new laws  or with current and future environmental and worker health and safety laws  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental remediation obligations 
in addition to operational standards  environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation  often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination 
accordingly  we may be liable  either contractually or by operation of law  for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us  is a landfill or other location where we have disposed wastes  or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property 
given the nature of the past industrial operations conducted by us and others at these properties  there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified  even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted 
we do not believe that any of our existing remediation obligations  including at third party sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party  will have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations or financial condition 
however  future events  such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement  or the discovery of currently unknown contamination  may give rise to additional remediation liabilities that may be material 
see environmental matters under note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in our annual report on form k for a discussion of these and other environmental related matters 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of our executive officers and the inability to attract and retain appropriately qualified replacements or the diversion of our chief executive officer s time and energy to permitted outside interests  including with respect to his obligations to a special purpose acquisition company 
we are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our executive officers  particularly martin e 
franklin  our chairman and chief executive officer  ian gh ashken  our vice chairman and chief financial officer  and james e 
lillie  our president and chief operating officer 
we believe these officers experience in the 
table of contents branded consumer products industry and our business  and with strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses within our primary business segments  has been important to our historical growth and is important to our future growth strategy 
we currently have employment agreements with all of these executive officers 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain any of these executive officers 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of these executive officers and the inability to attract and retain appropriately qualified replacements 
we do not maintain key man insurance on any of our executive officers 
messrs 
franklin and ashken have other interests and engage in other activities beyond their positions at jarden something they are permitted to do under the terms of their employment agreements with us provided such other activities do not interfere with their duties as an executive of jarden or directly compete with us 
in particular  mr 
franklin is chairman of the board of directors of freedom acquisition holdings inc freedom  a special purpose acquisition company formed to acquire one or more operating businesses within months of becoming a public company 
marlin equities ii  llc  an investment vehicle majority owned by its managing member  mr 
franklin  and mr 
ashken  the other principal member  is one of the principal stockholders of freedom 
freedom s registration statement on form s previously filed with the commission in late was declared effective by the commission on december  freedom consummated its initial public offering on december   but has not announced any specific merger  acquisition  or other strategic transaction under consideration 
freedom s operations will be dependent upon a relatively small group of key officers and directors  including mr 
franklin  at least until freedom has consummated a business combination 
because mr 
franklin will have an obligation to assist freedom in actively sourcing and acquiring target businesses  he will be required to spend time and energy such time and energy may be potentially significant that he might otherwise devote to jarden on behalf of another enterprise  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
mr 
franklin has committed to our board of directors that freedom will be seeking transactions outside of those that fit within jarden s publicly announced acquisition criteria and that freedom will not interfere with mr 
franklin s or mr 
ashken s obligations to jarden 
mr 
franklin also committed to the board that in order to avoid the potential for a conflict  prior to freedom s pursuing any acquisition transaction that jarden might consider  mr 
franklin would first confirm with an independent committee of our board of directors that jarden was not interested in pursuing the potential acquisition opportunity 
if the independent committee concludes that jarden was interested in that opportunity  freedom would not continue with that transaction 
however  we cannot assure you that freedom will not choose to pursue transactions that jarden would have considered 
if freedom pursues transactions that jarden would have considered  this could negatively impact jarden s growth from future acquisitions 
our failure to generate sufficient cash to meet our liquidity needs may affect our ability to service our indebtedness and grow our business 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness  including our notes and amounts borrowed under our senior credit facility  and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and strategic acquisitions we may make in the future  if any  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  together with available cash and available borrowings under our senior credit facility will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  that our currently anticipated growth in revenues and cash flow will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service indebtedness  including the debt securities  grow our business or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

table of contents changes in foreign  cultural  political and financial market conditions could impair our international operations and financial performance 
some of our operations are conducted or products are sold in countries where economic growth has slowed  such as japan  or where economies have suffered economic  social and or political instability or hyperinflation or where the ability to repatriate funds has been delayed or impaired in recent years  such as mexico and venezuela 
the economies of other foreign countries important to our operations  including other countries in europe  latin america and asia  could also suffer slower economic growth or economic  social and or political instability in the future 
international operations  including manufacturing and sourcing operations and the international operations of our customers  are subject to inherent risks which could adversely affect us  including  among other things new restrictions on access to markets  lack of developed infrastructure  inflation  fluctuations in the value of currencies  changes in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  including tax laws  accounting standards  environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws  political and economic instability  increases in duties and taxation  restrictions on transfer of funds  restrictions on foreign ownership of property and or expropriation of foreign owned assets  and other adverse changes in policies  including monetary  tax and or lending policies  encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries 
should any of these risks occur  our ability to export our products or repatriate profits could be impaired and we could experience a loss of sales and profitability from our international operations 
currency fluctuations may significantly increase our expenses and affect our results of operations  especially where the currency is subject to intense political and other environmental pressure  such as in the case of the venezuelan bolivar and the chinese renminbi 
while we transact business predominantly in us dollars and most of our revenues are collected in us dollars  a substantial portion of our costs  such as payroll  rent and indirect operational costs  are denominated in other currencies  such as the european euro  british pound  mexican peso  canadian dollar  venezuelan bolivar  japanese yen and chinese renminbi 
changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect our sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses 
for example  a devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar would impact our results of operations because the earnings of our venezuelan operations would be reduced when translated into us dollars 
a stronger mexican peso would mean our products assembled or produced in mexico would be more expensive to import into the united states or other countries  thereby reducing profitability of those products 
likewise  if the government of china allowed the chinese renminbi to rise substantially versus the us dollar  the cost of our products produced in china would rise 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
there can be no assurance that the us dollar foreign exchange rates will be stable in the future or that fluctuations in financial markets will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in the retail industry and markets for consumer products affecting our customers or retailing practices could negatively impact existing customer relationships and our results of operations 
we sell branded consumables  consumer solutions and outdoor solutions products to retailers  including club  department store  drug  grocery  mass merchant  sporting goods and specialty retailers  as well as direct to 
table of contents consumers 
a significant deterioration in the financial condition of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we regularly monitor and evaluate the credit status of our customers and attempt to adjust sales terms as appropriate 
despite these efforts  a bankruptcy filing by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels  there is a growing trend among retailers to make purchases on a just in time basis 
this requires us to shorten our lead time for production in certain cases and more closely anticipate demand  which could in the future require us to carry additional inventories 
with the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation  we are increasingly dependent upon key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
we may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailer customers  such as inventory destocking  limitations on access to shelf space  use of private label brands  price demands and other conditions  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
our business involves the potential for product recalls  product liability and other claims against us  which could affect our earnings and financial condition 
as a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products  we are subject to the consumer products safety act  which empowers the consumer products safety commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous 
under certain circumstances  the consumer products safety commission could require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products 
additionally  laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some cities and states  as well as in other countries in which we sell our products  and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 
any repurchase or recall of our products could be costly to us and could damage our reputation 
if we were required to remove  or we voluntarily removed  our products from the market  our reputation could be tarnished and we might have large quantities of finished products that we could not sell 
we also face exposure to product liability claims in the event that one of our products is alleged to have resulted in property damage  bodily injury or other adverse effects 
although we maintain product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are reasonable  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms  if at all  in the future or that product liability claims will not exceed the amount of insurance coverage 
additionally  we do not maintain product recall insurance 
as a result  product recalls or product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we face potential exposure to unusual or significant litigation arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise 
we spend substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental and other applicable standards 
however  compliance with these standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits  which can entail significant cost and risk 
we do not maintain insurance against many types of claims involving alleged defects in our products that do not involve personal injury or property damage 
as a result  these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our product liability insurance program is an occurrence based program based on our current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance 
we currently either self insure or administer a high retention insurance program for product liability risks 
historically  product liability awards have rarely exceeded our individual per occurrence self insured retention 
we cannot assure you  however  that our future product liability experience will be consistent with our past experience 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for a discussion of these and other regulatory and litigation related matters 

table of contents if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours  which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations 
our success with our proprietary products depends  in part  on our ability to protect our current and future technologies and products and to defend our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours 
our principal intellectual property rights include our trademarks 
in our branded consumables segment  these include the ball  bee  bernardin  bicycle  brk  crawford  diamond  first alert  forster  hoyle  kerr  kem  lehigh  leslie locke  loew cornell  pine mountain and storehorse brand names 
in the consumer solutions segment  the principal trademarks consist of bionaire  crock pot  foodsaver  health o meter  holmes  mr 
coffee  oster  patton  rival  seal a meal and sunbeam 
our other brands used include health at home  mixmaster  osterizer  hydrosurge and blanket with a brain 
the principal trademarks in outdoor solutions are coleman and campingaz 
other trademarks in that segment include coleman exponent and roadtrip 
we also hold numerous design and utility patents covering a wide variety of products 
we cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our patent applications or that any existing or future patents that we receive or license will provide competitive advantages for our products 
we also cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge  invalidate or avoid the application of any existing or future patents that we receive or license 
in addition  patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing  using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products 
we may not be able to implement or operate successfully and without interruptions the operating software systems and other computer technologies that we depend on to operate our business  which could negatively impact or disrupt our business 
we are in the process of selecting or implementing new operating software systems within a number of our business segments and complications from these projects could cause considerable disruptions to our business 
while significant testing will take place and the rollout will occur in stages  the period of change from the old system to the new system will involve risk 
application program bugs  system conflict crashes  user error  data integrity issues  customer data conflicts and integration issues among our legacy systems all pose potential risks 
implementing data standards such as rfid  which our largest customers are requiring that we use  involves significant effort across the entire organization 
any problems with or delays of this implementation could impact our ability to do business and could result in higher implementation costs and reallocation of human resources 
we rely on other companies to maintain some of our information technology infrastructure 
should they fail to perform due to events outside our control  it could affect our service levels and threaten our ability to conduct business 
in addition  natural disasters such as hurricanes may disrupt our infrastructure and our disaster recovery process may not be sufficient to protect against loss 
additionally  our business operations are dependent on our logistical systems  which include our order management systems and our computerized warehouse systems 
any interruption in our logistical systems could impact our ability to procure our products from our factories and suppliers  transport them to our distribution facilities  store them and deliver them to our customers on time and in the correct amounts 
failure to successfully implement our reorganization and acquisition related projects timely and economically could materially increase our costs and impair our results of operations 
we are in the process of significant reorganization and acquisition related projects 
there can be no assurance that these projects can be completed on time or within our projected costs 
furthermore  these projects will result in an increased reliance on sourced finished goods from third parties  particularly international vendors 
our failure to implement these projects economically and successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents a deterioration of relations with our labor unions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
approximately union workers are covered by four collective bargaining agreements at four of our us facilities 
these agreements expire at our jar closure facility muncie  indiana in october  at our kitchen match and toothpick manufacturing facility cloquet  minnesota in february  at our metals facility greeneville  tennessee in october  and at our fire extinguisher plant aurora  illinois in may additionally  approximately employees at our legutiano  spain manufacturing facility  employees at our lyon  france facility  employees at our barquisemeto  venezuela facility and employees at our acuna  mexico facility are unionized 
we have not experienced a work stoppage during the past five years except for brief work stoppages in in lyon  france in connection with our restructurings at that location 
however  we cannot assure you that there will not be a work stoppage in the future 
any such work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new securities and exchange commission the commission regulations and new york stock exchange market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity 
as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
furthermore  our board members  chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which could harm our business 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed 
our indebtedness imposes constraints and requirements on our business and financial performance and our compliance and performance in relationship to these could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
our significant indebtedness and other liabilities could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 

table of contents the terms of our senior credit facility and the indenture governing the notes allow us to issue and incur additional debt upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions we pursue as part of our business strategy or potential stock repurchase programs may be financed through a combination of cash on hand  operating cash flow  availability under our existing credit facilities and new capital market offerings 
if new debt is added to current debt levels  the related risks described above would increase 
our senior credit facility and the indenture related to our notes contain various covenants which limit our management s discretion in the operation of our business and the failure to comply with such convents could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our senior credit facility and the indenture related to our notes contain various provisions that limit our management s discretion by restricting our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  capital stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  incur liens  transfer or sell assets  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  our senior credit facility requires us to meet certain financial ratios 
any failure to comply with the restrictions of our senior credit facility and the indenture related to our notes or any other subsequent financing agreements may result in an event of default 
an event of default may allow the creditors  if the agreements so provide  to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
in addition  the lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds 
furthermore  substantially all of our domestic assets including equity interests are pledged to secure our indebtedness under our senior credit facility 
if we default on the financial covenants in our senior credit facility  our lenders could foreclose on their security interest in such assets  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

h ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  is presented in this annual report on form k because the company s credit facility and senior subordinated notes contain financial and other covenants which are based on or refer to the company s ebitda 
in this regard  gaap refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
additionally  ebitda is a basis upon which our management assesses financial performance and the company believes it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in measuring the operating performance and creditworthiness of companies with comparable market capitalization to the company  many of which present ebitda when reporting their results 
furthermore  ebitda is one of the factors used to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees 
ebitda is widely used by the company to evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
while ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements  it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered a primary measure of the company s performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with  and not as substitute for  financial measurements prepared in accordance with gaap that are presented in this annual report on form k
