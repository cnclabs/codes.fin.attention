overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions 
we provide comprehensive electronics design  production  product management and after market services to companies in the aerospace  automotive  computing  consumer  defense  industrial  instrumentation  medical  networking  peripherals  storage and telecommunications industries 
the industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of manufacturing and design services to companies that utilize electronics components in their products 
the industry experienced rapid change and growth through the s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion  and  in some cases  all of their manufacturing requirements 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements  which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn at the time 
in response to this industry and global economic downturn  we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers 
during the third quarter of our fiscal year  we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure due to the global economic downturn 
this restructuring program included reductions in workforce  re sizing of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites 
the macroeconomic conditions for us  and the electronic manufacturing services industry as a whole  continued to deteriorate during our fiscal year  resulting in additional restructuring programs being implemented during our fiscal year 
these restructuring programs included reductions in workforce  re sizing of facilities and the closure of facilities 
industry revenues generally began to stabilize in and companies continued to turn to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing 
during our fiscal year we initiated a restructuring program to realign our manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size our manufacturing sites with perceived market conditions 
over the last three years we have made concentrated efforts to diversify our industry sectors and customer base through acquisitions and organic growth 
we believe further growth opportunities exist for the industry to penetrate the worldwide electronics markets 
on september   we reorganized our manufacturing business into a consumer electronics division and an ems division 
our ams division will continue to provide warranty and repair services to certain of our manufacturing customers  but principally to other customers 
we believe that these divisions will provide cost effective solutions for our customers by grouping business units with similar needs together into divisions  each with full accountability for design  operations  supply chain and delivery 
the consumer electronics division has dedicated resources designed to meet the particular needs of the consumer products industry 
the division focuses on cell phones and mobile products  televisions  set top boxes and peripheral products such as printers 
we intend that the consumer electronics division  as a result of its dedicated design resources combined with its vertically integrated supply chain solutions and certain existing and planned manufacturing operations  will provide a focused complement of assets to provide low cost solutions for consumer electronics customers 
the ems division focuses on the traditional and emerging electronic manufacturing services business sectors 
traditional sectors  characterized by longer historical use of the electronics outsourcing model  include networking  computing  storage and telecommunications businesses 
emerging sectors are newer to the outsourcing model and include the automotive  medical  industrial  instrumentation  defense and aerospace sectors 

table of contents we derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we recognize revenue  net of estimated product return costs  generally when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors  including variation in demand for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategies  and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers 
demand for our customers products depends on  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins 
as our capacity has grown during recent years through the construction of new greenfield facilities  the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in r d of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expenses of these r d activities are reflected in the research and development line item in our consolidated statement of earnings 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the united states are denominated in local currencies 
we economically hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings 
see risk factors we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations 
we currently depend  and expect to continue to depend  upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with 
table of contents us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see risk factors because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue and note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
summary of results net revenue for fiscal year increased approximately to billion compared to billion for fiscal year our sales levels during fiscal year improved across most industry sectors  demonstrating our continued trend of industry sector and customer diversification 
the increase in our net revenue base year over year primarily represents stronger market share with our existing programs  organic growth from new and existing customers as vertical companies continue to convert to an outsourcing model  and additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions 
see note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our recent business acquisitions 
additionally  we continue to enhance our business model by adding services in the areas of collaborative design  system integration  order fulfillment and after market 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size our manufacturing sites with perceived current market conditions the restructuring plan 
based on the analysis completed to date  we currently expect to recognize approximately million in restructuring and impairment charges as a result of the restructuring plan 
the restructuring charges include pre tax employee severance and benefit costs  contract termination costs and other related restructuring costs 
the impairment charges include pre tax fixed asset impairment costs  as well as valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets 
we recognized a significant portion of these costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and during fiscal year and currently expect to recognize the remaining portion primarily over the course of fiscal year with certain contract termination costs to be incurred through fiscal year the exact timing of the remaining estimated range of restructuring and impairment costs  as well as the remaining estimated cost ranges by category type is subject to revision 
this information will be subject to the finalization of the timetables for the transitional functions  consultation with employees and their representatives  as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted 
the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors 
for further discussion of this restructuring program and the restructuring and impairment costs recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and during fiscal year  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges and note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements

fiscal year ended august  net revenue gross profit operating income net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share 
table of contents key performance indicators management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the company s operating results 
the following table sets forth  for the quarterly periods indicated  certain of management s key financial performance indicators 
three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days the sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory  less the days in accounts payable  accordingly  the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators 
days in accounts receivable decreased one day to days during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter and decreased one day to days during the three months ended may  from the prior sequential quarter 
the decrease in both of these periods was primarily due to timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarters 
during the three months ended february   days in accounts receivable decreased one day to days as a result of both timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter and related seasonality factors 
days in accounts receivable increased three days to days during the three months ended november  primarily due to the same factors 
days in inventory decreased four days to days during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter and decreased three days to days during the three months ended may  from the prior sequential quarter 
inventory turns remained consistent at eight turns during both of these three month periods 
the decrease in days in inventory during the fourth fiscal quarter and third fiscal quarter was primarily due to a reduction in inventory levels as a result of improved inventory management 
during the three months ended february   days in inventory increased four days to days in anticipation of forecasted demand and due to inventory acquired in the green point acquisition  while inventory turns decreased one turn to turns 
days in inventory decreased one day to  while inventory turns remained consistent at turns during the three months ended november  the decrease in days in inventory was primarily a result of increased sales during the quarter and related seasonality factors 
days in accounts payable increased one day to days during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter and remained consistent at days during the three months ended may  from the prior sequential quarter 
during the three months ended february  and the three months ended november   days in accounts payable decreased three days to days and decreased seven days to days  respectively  from the prior sequential quarter as a result of timing of purchases and payments for purchases during the quarter 
the sales cycle was days during the three months ended august  and was days during the three months ended august  this increase was due to changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from after market services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from product sales and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on management s assessment of specific customer balances  considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer 
if there is an adverse change in the financial condition of our customers  or if actual defaults are higher than provided for  an addition to the allowance may be necessary 
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage and other lower of cost or market considerations 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy 
for further discussion of our current restructuring program  refer to note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the allocation of amortizable intangible assets 
table of contents impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  we are required to perform a goodwill impairment test at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
we completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
the impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level  which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments as defined in note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
the impairment analysis is based on assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections at the reporting unit level 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill or intangible assets include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand  and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy 
for further information on our intangible assets  including goodwill  refer to note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment charges we have recognized restructuring and impairment charges related to reductions in workforce  re sizing and closure of facilities  and the transition of production from certain facilities into other new and existing facilities 
these charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management 
the recognition of restructuring and impairment charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with these plans 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs 
for further discussion of our restructuring programs  refer to note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
pension and other postretirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities  which are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates and return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data 
the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
this rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
when considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we take into account current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits  refer to note pension and other postretirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased 
table of contents or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in either income tax expense or goodwill 
for further discussion related to our income taxes  refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payment  sfas r and the security and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  we began recognizing stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of earnings on september  based on the fair value of our stock based awards 
the fair value of options granted prior to september  were valued using the black scholes model while the stock appreciation rights granted after this date were valued using a lattice valuation model 
option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the option or stock appreciation right and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock awards that are expected to vest as a result of satisfaction of time based vesting schedules or the achievement of certain performance conditions 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation could increase or decrease 
for further discussion of our stock based compensation  refer to note stockholders equity to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data as a percentage of net revenue

our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase was due to increased sales levels across most industry sectors  as well as additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions 
see note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on our recent business acquisitions 
specific increases include a increase in the sale of networking products  a increase in the sale of other products  principally related to after market services  a increase in the sale of peripheral products  a increase in the sale of 
table of contents instrumentation and medical products  and an increase in the sale of computing and storage products 
the level of sales of automotive products and consumer products remained consistent with the prior year while telecommunication sales decreased 
the increased sales levels were due to the addition of new customers and organic growth in these industry sectors  as well as additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions as discussed above 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
the distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to the following increased business from new and existing customers  fluctuations in customer demand  seasonality  especially in the automotive and consumer industry sectors  and increased growth in the automotive  consumer  and instrumentation and medical products industry sectors as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas 
fiscal year ended august  automotive computing and storage consumer instrumentation and medical networking peripherals telecommunications other total foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year we currently expect our foreign source revenue to slightly increase as a percentage of net revenue over the course of fiscal year due to expansion in asia  eastern europe and india 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to of net revenue in fiscal year from in fiscal year the percentage decrease from the prior fiscal year was partially due to having a higher portion of materials based revenue  driven in part by growth in our networking sector 
in addition  due to the inefficiencies in our current consumer model which has adversely impacted margins  we are shifting to a more integrated model with one customer and shifting to a more vertical solution that will integrate our green point services for another significant customer 
in addition  we have exited production of targeted products in the consumer sector 
in absolute dollars  gross profit for fiscal year increased million versus fiscal year due to the increased revenue base 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue in fiscal year the absolute dollar increase was largely due to increased costs primarily in eastern europe and asia to support our operational growth and expansion within those areas  the acquisition of green point in april  incremental stock based compensation expense associated with our annual grant of stock based awards to employees  legal and accounting expenses incurred during fiscal year related to the independent stock option review that was performed  and incremental costs in fiscal year due to the acquisition of celetronix in march r d 
r d expenses in fiscal year increased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue in fiscal year the increase is attributed to growth in our product development activities related to new platform designs  including cell phone modules  wireless and broadband 
table of contents access products  consumer entertainment products  and enterprise storage products 
we also continued efforts in new product technologies and the related production design processes  and the development of new advanced manufacturing technologies 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year  offset by certain fully amortized intangible assets 
for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets  note goodwill and other intangible assets and note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment charges 
as mentioned in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary of results  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we initiated the restructuring plan 
the restructuring plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million for fiscal year consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million  fixed asset impairments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of approximately million  primarily related to the repayment of government provided subsidies that resulted from the reduction in force in certain locations 
during fiscal year  the restructuring plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million  consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million  fixed asset impairments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of approximately million  offset by million of proceeds received in connection with facility closure costs 
these restructuring and impairment charges related to the restructuring plan incurred through august  of million include cash costs totaling million  of which million was paid in the fourth fiscal quarter of and million was paid in fiscal year the cash costs consist of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million and other restructuring income of million 
non cash costs of approximately million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities 
at august   liabilities of approximately million related to these restructurings activities are expected to be paid out in fiscal year the remaining liability of million is related to certain lease commitments and employee severance and termination benefit payments and is expected to be paid out primarily during fiscal years through by the end of fiscal year  as a result of the restructuring activities completed through august  related to the restructuring plan  we expect to avoid annual costs of approximately million that would otherwise have been incurred if the restructuring activities had not been completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and in fiscal year the expected avoided annual costs consist of a reduction in employee related expenses of approximately million  a reduction in depreciation expense associated with impaired fixed assets of approximately million  and a reduction in rent expense associated with leased buildings that have been vacated of approximately million 
the majority of these annual cost savings will be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue  with a small portion being reflected as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expense 
these annual costs savings are expected to be offset by decreased revenues associated with certain products that are approaching the end of life stage  decreased revenues as a result of shifting production to plants located in lower cost regions where competitive environmental pressures require that we pass those cost savings onto our customers  and incremental employee related costs expected to be 
table of contents incurred by those plants to which the production will be shifted 
after considering these cost savings offsets  we currently expect to realize net annualized cost savings of approximately to million by the end of fiscal year for further discussion of the current restructuring program  see overview summary of results above  and note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made the final cash payment related to our historical restructuring program 
a liability balance of approximately thousand remained after remittance of the final payment 
this remaining liability was recorded as a reduction of the fiscal year restructuring charge 
other expense 
we recorded other expense on the sale of accounts receivable under our securitization program totaling million and million for the fiscal years ending august  and  respectively 
the increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in the amount of receivables sold under the program during the fiscal year ended august  for further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program  see note accounts receivable securitization to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower levels of operating cash  cash deposits and cash equivalents due to the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our debt agreements 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility  as well as borrowings under our bridge facility that was entered into on december   primarily to fund the tender offer and merger with green point 
income taxes 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the decrease is primarily a result of the absence of tax expense associated with recording valuation allowances in fiscal year of million on net deferred tax assets as a result of our restructuring plan 
for further discussion of the restructuring plan  see note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements 
the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the united states  primarily due to tax incentives  including tax holidays  granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  india  malaysia and poland that expire at various dates through such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase was due to increased sales levels across most industry sectors 
specific increases include a increase in the sale of consumer products  a increase in the sale of instrumentation and medical products  a increase in the sale of computing and storage products  a increase in the sale of networking products  and a increase in the sale of peripheral products 
the level of sales of automotive products and telecommunications products remained consistent with the prior year 
the increased sales levels were due to the addition of new customers and organic growth in these industry sectors 
the increase in the consumer industry sector was primarily attributable to new and existing program growth resulting from our product diversification efforts within the sector 
the increase in the instrumentation and medical industry sector was primarily attributable to increased sales levels as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
the distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to the following increased business from new and existing customers  fluctuations in customer demand  seasonality  especially in the automotive and consumer industry sectors  and increased growth in the automotive  consumer  and instrumentation and medical products industry sectors as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas

gross profit decreased to of net revenue in fiscal year from in fiscal year the percentage decrease from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a higher portion of materials based revenue driven in part by growth in the consumer industry sector 
in addition  certain higher than anticipated expenses were incurred during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year these included delays in our ramp up of our electromechanical tooling operations due to resolvable technical issues  management process software and a change in a customer s timing needs for tools  which resulted in excess costs  certain material and labor costs associated with the higher than anticipated rate of needed repair on a new program for an existing customer in our after market services operations in the americas region  and various operational execution issues in one of our us operations  some of which was associated with strong demand and the commencement of new programs 
in absolute dollars  gross profit for fiscal year increased million versus fiscal year due to the increased revenue base

restructuring and impairment charges 
as mentioned in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary of results  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we initiated a restructuring program to realign our manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size our manufacturing sites with perceived current market conditions 
this current restructuring program resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million for fiscal year consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million  fixed asset impairments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of approximately million  primarily related to the repayment of government provided subsidies that resulted from the reduction in force in certain locations 
these restructuring and impairment charges included cash costs totaling million  of which million was paid in the fourth fiscal quarter of the cash costs consist of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of million 
non cash costs of approximately million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made the final cash payment related to our historical restructuring program 
a liability balance of approximately thousand remained after remittance of the final payment 
this remaining liability was recorded as a reduction of the fiscal year restructuring charge 
there were no restructuring and impairment charges incurred during fiscal year other expense 
we recorded other expense on the sale of accounts receivable under our securitization program totaling million and million for the fiscal year ending august  and  respectively 
the increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in the amount of receivables sold under the program during the fiscal year ended august  subsequent to january  several amendments increased the net cash proceeds available at any one time under the program from million to million 
for further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program  see note accounts receivable securitization to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher interest yields on higher levels of operating cash  cash deposits and cash equivalents 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of higher borrowing levels under our unsecured revolving credit facility and under other revolving credit facilities and debt agreements in place at a subsidiary level 
additionally  we incurred higher interest on our fixed senior notes issued in july of due to the termination of the interest rate swap agreement in june the interest rate swap effectively converted the fixed interest rate of the senior notes to a variable rate during the nine months ended may   which was more favorable than the fixed rate of interest incurred subsequent to may  see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements

income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the increase is primarily a result of the tax expense associated with recording valuation allowances of million on net deferred tax assets as a result of our 
table of contents restructuring plan 
for further discussion of the restructuring plan  see note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements 
this increase was partially offset by the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation expense realized in accordance with sfas r  which we adopted in the first quarter of fiscal year the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the united states  primarily due to tax incentives  including tax holidays  granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  india  malaysia and poland that expire at various dates through such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply
