table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the partnership is a producer and marketer of nitrogen products for use in agricultural and industrial markets 
nitrogen is a commodity chemical and prices are established based on global supply and demand conditions 
the nitrogen products industry has cycles of oversupply  resulting in lower prices and idled capacity  followed by supply shortages  resulting in high selling prices and higher industry wide production rates 
to be viable under these market conditions  a producer must be among the low cost producers to markets it serves and have a financial position that can sustain it during periods of oversupply 
during  the partnership determined that market conditions did not justify the ongoing investment in maintenance and replacement capital necessary to extend operations for the remainder of the established useful life at its blytheville  arkansas facility 
accordingly  the partnership recorded a million charge in as an impairment of long lived assets and permanently halted production at the facility in may during the third quarter of  the blytheville facility was disposed 
the partnership continues to produce nitrogen products at its verdigris  oklahoma facility 
natural gas is the most significant raw material in the production of nitrogen products 
during periods of significant increases in natural gas prices  the partnership may curtail or shut down its production facilities if finished goods prices do not increase to levels allowing the partnership to cover variable production costs 
the partnership s cost of natural gas increased to unprecedented levels in the third quarter due to supply disruptions caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
this trend continued into during the second quarter of  natural gas prices decreased to pre hurricane prices 
imports  most of which are produced at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies  account for a significant portion of us nitrogen product supply 
imported products natural gas costs have been and could continue to be substantially lower than the delivered cost of natural gas to the partnership s facilities 
offshore producers are most competitive in regions close to north american points of entry for imports  including the gulf coast and east coast 
the partnership s sales volumes primarily depend upon the operating rates for its plants 
the partnership may purchase product from other manufacturers or importers for resale  but historic gross margins on these volumes are rarely significant 
the profitability and cash flows from the partnership s operations are affected by its ability to manage its costs and expenses other than natural gas  most of which do not materially change for different levels of production or sales 
other factors affecting the partnership s operating results include the number of planted acres  transportation costs  weather conditions particularly during the planting season  grain prices and other variables described in item business and item properties section of this report 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the partnership s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different amounts being reported under different assumptions and conditions 
the partnership s critical accounting policies are described below 
derivatives and financial instruments the partnership accounts for derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period that the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the general partner enters into derivative instruments including future contracts  swap agreements  put and call options to cap or fix prices for a portion of the partnership s natural gas production requirements 
the general partner also uses similar derivative instruments to fix or set floor prices for a portion of the partnership s nitrogen sales volumes 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or estimated net realizable value 
the partnership performs a monthly analysis of its inventory balances to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value 
the analysis of estimated realizable value is based on customer orders  market trends and historical pricing 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated net realizable value  the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated net realizable value 
production costs include the cost of direct labor and materials  depreciation and amortization  and overhead costs related to manufacturing activities 
the cost of inventories is determined using the first in  first out method 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a transaction exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  no obligations remain and collectibility is probable 
the partnership classifies any discounts and trade allowances as a reduction in revenue 
gains or losses associated with settled nitrogen derivative contracts are classified as revenue 
the partnership classifies amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling as revenue 
factors that affect operating performance factors that may affect the partnership s operating results include the relative balance of supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers  the availability and cost of natural gas  the number of planted acres which is affected by both worldwide demand and government policies  the types of crops planted  the effects general weather patterns have on the timing and duration of fieldwork for crop planting and harvesting  the effect of environmental legislation on supply and demand for the partnership s products  the availability of financing sources to fund seasonal working capital needs and the potential for interruption to operations due to accidents or natural disasters 
the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen products is natural gas 
natural gas costs in accounted for approximately of total costs and expenses for the partnership 
a significant increase in the price of natural gas that is not covered by forward pricing arrangements or recovered through an 
table of contents increase in the price of related nitrogen products would have an adverse effect on the partnership s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a portion of global nitrogen products is manufactured at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies that have been  and could continue to be  priced substantially lower than the partnership s natural gas 
prices for nitrogen products are influenced by the world supply and demand balance for ammonia and other nitrogen based products 
long term demand is affected by population growth and rising living standards that influence food consumption 
short term demand is affected by world economic conditions and international trade decisions 
supply is affected by increasing worldwide capacity and the availability of nitrogen product exports from major producing regions such as the former soviet union  the middle east and south america 
weather can significantly affect demand for the partnership s products 
weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt fieldwork during the planting season may cause agricultural customers to use forms of nitrogen fertilizer that are more or less favorable to the partnership s sales 
weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall 
weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields  which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to pay for crop inputs purchased from the partnership s dealer customers 
conversely  low crop yields often increase the planted areas in the subsequent growing season  which  in turn  increases the demand for nitrogen fertilizer 
the partnership s business is highly seasonal  with the majority of its products used during the second quarter in conjunction with spring planting 
due to the business seasonality and the relatively brief periods during which products can be used by customers  the partnership and its customers generally build inventories during the second half of the year to ensure product availability during the peak sales season 
for its current level of sales  the partnership maintains lines of credit  which can be used to fund inventory increases and to support customer credit terms 
the partnership believes that its credit facilities are adequate for expected sales levels 
the partnership s operations may be subject to significant interruption if its facility were to experience a major accident or natural disaster 
the partnership currently maintains insurance  including business interruption insurance  which it believes is sufficient to cover major damage to any of its facilities 
results of operations compared with the partnership s sales volumes and prices for and follow quantities in thousands of tons sales volumes avg 
unit price sales volumes avg 
unit price ammonia uan after deducting outbound freight costs revenues for decreased million  or  to million compared to million in the decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower uan sales prices and volumes  offset by increased ammonia prices 
uan prices decreased in as compared to due to lower natural gas costs and lower demand as a result of a decrease in planted corn acres 
the gross profit for was million  as compared to million in the million decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a million reduction to sales prices and million from lower sales volumes  offset by million in lower natural gas costs 
sales volumes decreased due to lower planted corn acres and drought conditions in the southwest united states 
natural gas prices 
table of contents declined due to increased levels of natural gas in storage 
natural gas costs in included the effects of forward pricing contracts that were million higher than natural gas spot prices 
operating expenses of million increased million  primarily as the result of increased management  selling and administrative expenses charged by terra to the partnership that included higher expenses for long term compensation programs that are tied to shareholder returns

unit price sales volumes avg 
unit price ammonia uan urea after deducting outbound freight costs revenues for increased million  or  to million compared with million in as the result of higher selling prices partly offset by lower sales volumes 
sales prices were higher primarily as the result of lower nitrogen fertilizer supplies caused by industry wide production curtailments since mid and higher natural gas costs 
price increases also reflected higher imported product costs as the result of increased delivery costs to us markets 
sales volumes in were lower than the previous year primarily due to the blytheville production facility s permanent closure in may gross profits during were million  an increase of million from higher selling prices contributed million to gross profits  but were offset by higher natural gas costs 
the cost of natural gas purchases increased million  over as unit costs  net of forward pricing gains and losses 
natural gas costs in were million higher than spot prices as the result of forward price contracts 
gross profits in also benefited from lower operating costs and higher production rates than at the verdigris facility 
operating expenses of million decreased million  or  primarily as the result of lower management  selling and administrative expense allocations from terra to the partnership  reflecting a december acquisition that expanded terra s base of operations over which its expenses are allocated 
liquidity and capital resources partnership cash receipts are generally received by terra capital  inc  terra capital the indirect parent of the general partner 
cash receipts  net of cash payments made by terra capital  are transferred to the partnership from terra capital on a weekly basis 
as a result of this cash collection and distribution arrangement  terra capital is a creditor to the partnership 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million  composed of million from operations and million from working capital changes 
the working capital changes were primarily due to a million increase in customer prepayments and accounts payable 
at december   the partnership had received million of customer order prepayments that it expects to fulfill during the first half of capital expenditures of million during were used primarily to fund replacement and stay in business additions to plant and equipment 
plant turnaround costs represent cash used for the periodic scheduled maintenance of the partnership s continuous process production facilities  generally every two 
table of contents years 
the partnership funded million of plant turnaround costs during the partnership expects capital expenditures and plant turnaround costs to be approximately million 
contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments  other than notes due to affiliates  were as follows at december  payments due in in thousands thereafter operating leases purchase obligations total the partnership s principal funding needs are to support its working capital and capital expenditures 
the partnership intends to fund its needs primarily from cash provided by operating activities and  to the extent required  from funds borrowed under the partnership s revolving bank credit facility 
the partnership has a million revolving bank credit facility that expires in february see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under the credit facility  the partnership may borrow an amount generally based on eligible cash balances  of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible finished goods inventory  less outstanding letters of credit 
at december   the partnership had million of borrowing availability under this credit facility 
the partnership s borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of its working capital 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the facility 
management expects the facility to be adequate to meet the partnership s operating cash needs 
under the credit facility  the partnership is subject to the covenants which impose certain limitations on additional debt  capital expenditures  acquisitions  liens  asset sales  investments  prepayments of subordinated indebtedness  changes in lines of business and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  if the partnership s aggregate borrowing availability falls below million  it is required to have generated million of operating cash flows or earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash items as defined in the credit facility for the preceding four quarters 
the partnership is also required to maintain a minimum aggregate unused borrowing availability of million at all times 
the partnership s ability to continue to meet the covenants under the credit facility in the future will depend on market conditions  operating cash flows  working capital needs  receipt of customer prepayments and trade credit terms 
failure to meet these covenants  or to obtain a waiver from the lenders  would result in a default by the partnership such that all outstanding amounts could become immediately due and payable and the partnership would be unable to borrow additional amounts under the credit facility 
because access to adequate bank facilities may be critical to funding the partnership s operating cash needs and purchase of financial derivatives to manage the partnership s exposure to natural gas commodity price risk  any default or termination of the joint revolving bank credit facility could have a material adverse effect on the partnership 
expenditures related to environmental  health and safety regulation compliance are primarily composed of operating costs that totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because environmental  health and safety regulations are expected to continue to change and generally to be more restrictive than current requirements  the costs of compliance will likely increase 
the partnership does not expect its compliance with such regulations will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position or net cash flows 
in addition  the partnership incurred million  million and million of capital expenditures in  and  respectively  related to capital improvements to ensure compliance with environmental  health and safety regulations 
the partnership may be required to install additional air and 
table of contents water quality control equipment  such as low nitrous oxide burners  scrubbers  ammonia sensors and continuous emission monitors to continue to achieve compliance with the clean air act and similar requirements 
these equipment requirements typically apply to competitors as well 
the partnership estimates that the cost of complying with these existing requirements in and beyond will be less than million 
quarterly distributions to the partnership s partners are based on available cash for the quarter as defined in the partnership agreement of limited partnership 
available cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements  adjusted for changes in certain reserves established as the general partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary 
distributions paid to the partners in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
prior to the restructuring of the partnership in the third quarter of  distributions of available cash were made to the limited partners and to the general partner 
subsequent to the restructuring of the partnership  distribution of available cash is made to the limited partners and to the general partner 
an affiliate of the general partner is entitled  as an incentive  to larger percentage interests to the extent that distributions of available cash exceed specified levels 
the specified levels are increased by the amount of quarterly distributions to holders of common units that are less than per unit 
as of december   the cumulative shortfall on quarterly distributions to holders of common units that must be paid before the general partner affiliate receives an incentive payment was million  or per unit 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas provides a single definition for fair value that is to be applied consistently for all accounting applications  and also generally describes and prioritizes according to reliability the methods and input used in valuations 
sfas also prescribes various disclosures about financial statement categories and amounts which are measured at fair value  if such disclosures are not already specified elsewhere in gaap 
the statement is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by the partnership in the first quarter of fiscal the partnership does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement and balance sheet approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
if prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial now are considered material based on either approach  no restatement in required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered 
if prior year s financial statements are not restated  the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
sab is effective for the fiscal year ending after november  the partnership adopted the provisions of sab on december  the partnership s adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the partnerships financial statements 

table of contents general partner option to effect mandatory redemption of partnership units at december   the general partner and its affiliates owned of the partnership s outstanding units 
when less than of the issued and outstanding units are held by non affiliates of the general partner  as is the case at december   the partnership  at the general partner s sole discretion  may call  or assign to the general partner or its affiliates its right to acquire  all such outstanding units held by non affiliated persons 
if the general partner elects to acquire all outstanding units  the partnership is required to give at least but not more than days notice of its decision to purchase the outstanding units 
the purchase price per unit will be the greater of the average of the previous trading days closing prices as of the date five days before the purchase is announced and the highest price paid by the general partner or any of its affiliates for any unit within the days preceding the date the purchase is announced 
dependence on terra industries the partnership is dependent on terra industries inc terra in a number of respects 
terra provides all of the partnership s management services and operates all of its facilities through its wholly owned subsidiary tngp  the general partner and tnc  the prior general partner 
terra and its wholly owned subsidiaries have more debt and debt service requirements than the partnership 
although terra is affected by most of the factors that affect the partnership  its higher level of debt could put a greater risk on terra in the event business conditions deteriorate materially 
while the restructuring was undertaken to reinforce the structural independence of the partnership from terra  the partnership s results of operations and financial condition might be materially adversely affected by financial difficulties at terra  default by it or its subsidiaries on their debt or their bankruptcy 
information regarding terra can be obtained in the various filings with the securities and exchange commission  including form k  form q and form k 
forward looking precautions information contained in this report  other than historical information  may be considered forward looking 
forward looking information reflects management s current views of future events and financial performance that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  the following changes in the financial markets  general economic conditions within the agricultural industry  competitive factors and price changes principally  nitrogen products selling prices and natural gas costs  changes in product mix  changes in the seasonality of demand patterns  changes in weather conditions  changes in agricultural regulations  and other risks detailed in the factors that affect operating results section of this discussion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and financial instruments market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the partnership due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the partnership uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk in the area of changes in natural gas prices 
the partnership has no foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the general partner s policy is to avoid unnecessary risk and to limit  to the extent practical  risks associated with operating activities 
the general partner may not engage in activities that expose the partnership to speculative or non operating risks 
management is expected to limit risks to acceptable levels 
the use of derivative financial instruments is consistent with the overall business objectives of the partnership 
derivatives are used to manage operating risk within the limits established by the general partner s board of directors  and in response to identified exposures  provided they qualify as hedge 
table of contents activities 
as such  derivative financial instruments are used to hedge firm commitments and forecasted commodity purchase transactions 
the use of derivative financial instruments subjects the partnership to some inherent risks associated with future contractual commitments  including market and operational risks  credit risk associated with counterparties  product location basis differentials and market liquidity 
the general partner continuously monitors the valuation of identified risks and adjusts the portfolio based on current market conditions 
natural gas is the principal raw material used to manufacture nitrogen 
natural gas prices are volatile and the general partner manages some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
the partnership s hedging policy is described under the previous heading  factors that affect operating performance 
the partnership has hedged approximately of anticipated requirements and none of its requirements beyond december  the fair value of these instruments is estimated based on published referenced prices and quoted market prices from brokers 
these instruments fixed natural gas prices at million higher than published prices for december  forward markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical price change 
changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
based on the partnership s derivatives outstanding at december   which included swaps  basis swaps and put options  a per mmbtu increase in nymex pricing would increase the partnership s natural gas costs by approximately million and a per mmbtu decrease in nymex pricing would decrease the partnership s natural gas costs by approximately million
