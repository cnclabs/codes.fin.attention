item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  and for each of the three years in the period then ended should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth elsewhere in this report 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  including our expectations of future industry conditions  strategic plans and forecasts of operational results 
various risks may cause our actual results to differ materially 
a list and description of some of the risks and uncertainties is contained below and in the summary of risk factors included in item a 
overview headquartered in reykjavik  iceland  decode is a biopharmaceutical company applying its discoveries in human genetics to develop drugs and diagnostics for common diseases 
our population approach and resources enable us to isolate genes and drug targets directly involved in the development of many of the diseases which pose the biggest challenges to public health 
we are turning these discoveries into a growing pipeline of therapeutics and diagnostic tests taking aim at the causes of disease  not just the signs and symptoms 
as these diseases are common and current therapies are of limited effectiveness  we believe that our strategy represents a significant opportunity to create better medicine with major potential in the global marketplace 
we believe that decode s advantage derives from our population approach to human genetics and the ability to apply this approach directly to drug and diagnostic development 
in iceland  we have comprehensive population resources that enable our scientists to isolate key genes and gene variants contributing to common diseases 
the proteins encoded by these genes  and other proteins with which they interact in the disease pathway  offer drug targets that we believe are directly involved in the onset and progression of disease 
our work indicates that these genes confer risk by increasing or decreasing the activity of common biological pathways  placing individuals on a spectrum of risk that encompasses the population as a whole 
small molecule drugs that can modulate the activity of the pathway in question may therefore have broad potential utility  not only to those at highest risk but perhaps also to those at average risk  which in the common diseases may be unacceptably high 
moreover  these pathways often provide biomarkers that can be used to assess the efficacy of a compound from preclinical to mid stage clinical testing 
we are also applying our findings to create dna based diagnostics 
because such tests analyze the same links between genetic variation and disease that we have used to identify drug targets  they can be employed as an aid in developing more effective disease prevention strategies by helping individuals to better understand their inherited risk of a given condition  as well as to identify patients likely to respond well to a given drug 
we expect to begin offering dna based diagnostic testing early in the second quarter of through our chemistry and structural biology units  based in the united states  we are able to discover novel small molecule therapeutic compounds  take candidate compounds through pre clinical testing  and manufacture sufficient quantities for early stage clinical trials 
our product development group  which has expertise in drug and disease modeling  designs and implements our clinical trials 
we also actively explore in licensing and co development opportunities  and in certain programs have brought directly into clinical trials compounds that address targets we have identified through our genetics research  but were originally developed by other companies for other indications 
decode has demonstrated its ability to discover novel therapeutic targets and compounds in major indications 
the company has also shown that it can efficiently advance these compounds into and through mid stage clinical trials providing a clear and detailed association to the biology of disease 
at the beginning of  we have completed and are analyzing the results of a phase iia clinical trial for dg  our developmental anti platelet compound for arterial thrombosis 
phase i studies showed dg to be well tolerated and to effectively reduce platelet aggregation without increasing bleeding time 
the phase ii study is examining safety  tolerability  dosing  and the effect of various dose levels on biomarkers of platelet activation in patients with peripheral artery disease  and we expect to initiate a second phase ii study in patients with other vascular disease by year end 
in decode s program targeting the leukotriene pathway for the prevention of heart attack  we recently completed a phase i single dose ranging study for one of its developmental compounds  dg  showing it to be safe and well tolerated in the doses tested  to have a pharmacokinetic profile that supports its suitability for once a day dosing  and to lower  in a dose dependent manner  levels of leukotriene b  the pro inflammatory biomarker that decode believes confers the increased risk of heart attack through this pathway 
decode began a multiple dose phase i trial for dg early this year and expects to begin phase ii testing by year end 
we are currently reformulating the tablets for dg  our phase iii compound for the prevention of heart attack  and expect to be in a position to restart our phase iii testing by year end or the first quarter of decode is conducting preclinical drug discovery work on its targets in stroke and vascular disease  which are the most advanced of its preclinical programs 
decode has a partnership with roche focused on the discovery and development of pde inhibitors for vascular disease  and a partnership with merck in obesity 
decode and illumina  inc are working together to develop dna based diagnostic kits utilizing decode s gene discoveries in heart attack  type diabetes and breast cancer and illumina s platform for snp genotyping 
the company is also actively exploring drug development partnerships in its most advanced therapeutic programs  in order to spread risk and cost  and to focus resources on the advancement of its drug discovery work and preclinical candidates 
decode also leverages its capabilities to provide services to fee paying customers 
our services and products include medicinal chemistry  process chemistry  structural biology  clinical trials  genotyping  and instruments and software 
revenue from these activities helps to support our drug discovery and development infrastructure  and conserve our cash resources for use in our proprietary therapeutics programs the goal of our business strategy is to maximize the creation of value from our human genetics  drug discovery and diagnostics work and to capture that value for us and our stockholders 
our product development pipeline now includes drug development programs in heart attack  and arterial thrombosis  and are advancing our diagnostics programs in type diabetes  arterial fibrillation  heart attack and prostate and breast cancer 
executing on our strategy advancing these programs swiftly while continuing our discovery work in a broad range of common diseases requires us to spread risk and manage cost 
we are constantly evaluating the optimal balance between proprietary and partnered product development  the level of our investment in research and development  the deployment of cash resources for product development  and the financing environment 
as we invest in proprietary programs  we leverage our capabilities to form corporate alliances and to provide services to fee paying customers 
we also receive contract and grant funding from various governmental agencies 
we have formed drug and other product development alliances with roche  merck  and illumina  among others 
our chemistry subsidiary provides drug discovery and contract manufacturing services to fee for service customers  and our other service offerings include protein crystallography products and instruments as well as protein structure analysis contract services through our structural biology subsidiary  clinical trials services through our encode cro  and dna analysis services through our genotyping laboratory in reykjavik 
we derive revenues primarily from research funding and other fees from our service customers and collaborative partners  as well as from research grants 
milestone payments and upfront  exclusivity  technology access and technology development fees under our collaboration agreements constitute another source of our revenues 
our expenses consist primarily of research and development expenses such as  salaries and related employee costs  materials and supplies  and contractor services 
we believe that our ongoing work in genetics  the advancement of our drug and diagnostic programs  and in particular the conduct of clinical trials  will require significant ongoing expenditures 
in  we completed our phase i dose ranging  pharmacokinetic and safety clinical program for dg  our developmental anti platelet compound for arterial thrombosis and concluded a phase iia trial  filed an ind and conducted a single dose ranging phase i study for dg for the prevention of heart attack  concluded our phase ii trial of cephalon s developmental compound cep in asthma  and designed and initiated a phase iii trial for dg for the prevention of heart attack  a trial that we voluntarily suspended in october in order to address a formulation problem with the tablets 
we are also developing reference laboratory diagnostic testing services 
we anticipate incurring additional net losses at least through the next several years  due to  in addition to the above mentioned factors  depreciation and amortization  as well as stock based compensation and other non cash charges 
we expect that our revenues and losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial  especially because progress in our scientific work and milestone payments that are related to progress can fluctuate between quarters 
we do not believe that comparisons of our quarter to quarter performance are a good indication of future performance 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and as we advance and broaden our drug development pipeline we will require significant additional capital for product development and so we will continue to investigate additional avenues of financing 
our ability to obtain capital in the future will be affected by conditions in the global financial markets and in the pharmaceutical industry 
we expect that more favorable conditions in those markets will present opportunities for us  while downturns in the market valuations of biotechnology companies and of the equity markets more generally will restrict our ability to raise additional capital on attractive terms 
the difficulties facing the pharmaceutical industry present for us both near term challenges and significant longer term opportunities 
one of the main issues confronting big pharmaceutical companies is their lack of promising new drugs to treat major indications 
as many leading brand name drugs come off patent and face generic competition  developing successful new medicines will become critical for filling the gap 
we believe that companies such as ours may be well positioned to play an important role in filling the gap in the pipeline of new drugs  either alone or as partners of pharmaceutical companies 
recent announcements demonstrate that the industry is already investing in the development of new therapeutics based on our approach 
drug development programs the following is a summary of the development of our drug candidates in late pre clinical or clinical development 
because of uncertainties involved in the drug development process  the actual timing for the events described below may differ materially from that provided in this summary 
we have two compounds in development for the prevention of heart attack 
these programs come out of our discovery of major risk variants in two genes encoding proteins in the leukotriene pathway 
these variants in the genes that code for lipoxygenase activating protein flap and leukotriene a hydrolase ltah appear to confer risk in the same way by causing an upregulation in the production of leukotriene b  a potent pro inflammatory molecule that is the end product of one branch of the pathway 
the therapeutic goal of both compounds is to inhibit the activity of the pathway  lowering the production of ltb and thereby decreasing the inflammatory activity in atherosclerotic plaques and reducing the risk of heart attack 
dg  discovered by decode s chemistry unit  is a small molecule inhibitor of ltah  which is directly involved in the synthesis of ltb the results of our development work to date on dg indicates that it is well tolerated  provides potent inhibition of ltb production  is orally bioavailable  has potential for once daily dosing  and appears to have minimal potential for drug interaction 
we completed a single dose ranging phase i study for dg in december and have initiated a multiple dose ranging phase i study 
the results from this study demonstrated well characterized pharmacokinetic parameters and a reduction of ltb in a dose dependent manner 
in may we began a phase iii clinical trial for dg  an inhibitor of flap which we licensed from bayer ag  but temporarily suspended this trial in october due to an unexpected formulation problem with the tablets 
in routine testing of clinical supplies we discovered that  over time  the drug tablets appeared to dissolve more slowly  potentially providing lessening amounts of active drug the longer they were stored 
this raised the possibility that as the trial progressed patients would be receiving too little drug  undermining the trial s chances of success 
we are currently reformulating the compound to resolve this issue and expect to be able to resume phase iii testing by year end or the first quarter of dg is being developed as a lesion specific anti platelet compound for the prevention of arterial thrombosis 
dg is a first in class small molecule inhibitor of the ep receptor for prostaglandin e  a g protein coupled receptor gpcr encoded by a gene we have shown to be associated with increased risk of arterial disease 
we believe that pge may have additive stimulatory effects on platelet aggregation beyond those of other potent agonists such as adp or thromboxane a  targeted by clopidogrel and aspirin  respectively 
in early  we concluded the phase i clinical program for dg nearly healthy subjects were exposed to dg in these studies 
the results of the phase i program showed dg to be well tolerated across the entire dose range studied  and that dg can effectively inhibit platelet aggregation in a dose dependent manner without increasing bleeding time 
in the second quarter of  we began a phase iia clinical trial that examined the effect of dg on certain plasma biomarkers 
we concluded this trial at the end of and expect to present the data during the second quarter of based on the results of our clinical trials thus far  we believe that dg may offer a focused means of preventing the formation of thrombi  with anti platelet activity specifically at the site of atherosclerotic lesions 
in asthma  we completed a phase iia trial of cephalon s compound cep  originally developed for treatment of parkinson s disease 
this compound inhibits mapk  a kinase encoded by a gene we have linked to risk of asthma 
in the phase iia trial we found that the compound had a dose related effect on both lung function and biomarkers associated with lung inflammation and severity of disease in patients with asthma who were already being treated with inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta agonist laba 
cephalon is currently reviewing clinical development plans for this compound 
among our most advanced preclinical programs  we are pursuing a pde inhibitor program for vascular disease stroke pursuant to our agreement with roche and are working on identifying and advancing a lead pre clinical compound 
we use many of our employee and infrastructure resources across several programs  and many of our research and development costs are indirectly attributable to an individually named program or are directed broadly to applicable research programs 
however  taking into account costs that are specifically attributable to individual programs and allocations of our research and development program costs based upon those direct costs  we have cumulatively invested million  million  million and million in our heart attack myocardial infarction  or mi  pad  stroke and asthma programs  respectively  from the beginning of to date 
inception to date costs are not available as these costs were not historically tracked by program 
we have not applied for or received marketing approval from the applicable regulatory authorities in any country for any of our drug candidates 
in order for us to achieve marketing approval in the united states  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish the safety and efficacy of our drug candidate 
other countries have similar requirements 
historically  the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials through phase ii have often not been predictive of success in later clinical trials 
many new compounds have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary marketing approvals 
additional risks and uncertainties involved in the development and commercialization of any products are described above under the caption risk factors 
we expect that it will be several years  if ever  before we receive revenues from the commercial sale of our therapeutic products 
furthermore  our strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products 
entering into a collaboration with a partner at any point in the development or commercialization of a product is a business decision 
when making this decision we do and will consider  among other matters  the complexity of the indication  the size  complexity and expense of necessary development and or commercialization efforts  competition in the market and size of the applicable market  an assessment of our own resources financial and operational  and an assessment of the resources of a potential partner 
in the event that we do collaborate on any of the above programs in the future  a partner will have a level of control  which may be significant  over the pre clinical development or clinical trial process for a product 
as a result the completion date of such a partnered program could largely be under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary drug candidate will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
acquisitions  joint development programs and in licensing as part of our business strategy  we continue to consider joint development programs and merger and acquisition opportunities that may provide us with products in late stage development  intellectual property or financial resources or with capabilities that will help accelerate our downstream drug discovery efforts 
uvs 
in january  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of urdur verdandi skuld ehf 
uvs  a privately held cancer research firm  from iceland genomics corporation  inc igc  both companies having their principal offices in reykjavik  iceland 
as consideration for the purchase  we issued  shares of decode common stock valued at  to igc 
this acquisition has enabled us to broaden our cancer program by applying our gene discovery and drug development efforts to a larger set of population resources 
illumina 
in may  we entered into a strategic alliance with illumina  inc illumina to develop and commercialize molecular diagnostic products 
under the terms of the agreement  decode and illumina will share development costs equally and split operating profits from the sales of diagnostic tests 
our initial focus will be developing diagnostics for heart attack  breast cancer and type diabetes 
also as part of the agreement  we have installed illumina s snp genotyping platform to carry out high density  whole genome studies utilizing our comprehensive population genetics resources in iceland  thereby  enabling us to expand our contract genotyping business to offer illumina s platform and assay technologies together with our proprietary analytical services for customers 
in certain programs we have taken advantage of the fact that drug targets we have identified through our genetics research have already been employed by other companies to make developmental compounds for other indications 
by licensing these compounds or entering into co development arrangements we have been able to leapfrog over several steps of drug discovery  entering directly into phase ii clinical trials 
dg  our most advanced compound for the prevention of heart attack  was licensed from bayer healthcare ag  which was initially developing it for asthma 
we also recently concluded a phase ii trial in asthma  working with cephalon on their compound cep  originally developed for parkinson s disease 
we continue to investigate additional such possibilities for co development of promising existing compounds that may effectively act against targets we have identified through our gene discovery work 
results of operations from the years ended december   and our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon  among other things  the pace and progress of our proprietary research and clinical development efforts  the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  and the progress of our own research and development efforts 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon collaborative partners  development by us or our competitors of new technological innovations  ability to market products or services  dependence on key personnel  dependence on key suppliers  protection of proprietary technology  ability to obtain additional financing  ability to negotiate collaborative arrangements  and compliance with governmental and other regulations 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct pre clinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic or diagnostic products for a period of years  if at all 
financial highlights as of and for the year ended december  include at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments compared to million at december  the net utilization of our cash and investments in reflects principally the costs associated with the advancement of our drug development programs as reflected in the million of cash we used in operating activities together with two financing campaigns raising a combined net total of approximately million 
research and development expense was million in as compared to million in and million in these increases are principally the result of costs associated with the advancement of our product development programs 
in may  we began a phase iii clinical trial for dg our lead developmental compound for the prevention of heart attack  and then in october we voluntarily suspended the trial in order to address an unexpected formulation problem with the tablets 
in august we began enrolling patients in a phase i clinical trial for dg  our follow on development compound for the prevention of heart attack 
earlier in  we initiated a phase iia trial for dg  our developmental compound in peripheral artery disease 
additionally  we have progressed proprietary pre clinical programs in stroke  obesity  and pain  among other indications 
in august we installed the illumina snp genotyping platform and have begun our high density  whole genome studies utilizing the platform together with our comprehensive population genetics resources in iceland 
our revenue was million in as compared to million in and million in the decline of our revenue is due principally to lower alliance revenues in  chiefly on account of the completion of the merck obesity research program in september and the more recent completion of research funding under the agreement with roche june 
in july we completed the sale of  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share for aggregate net proceeds  after costs of the transaction  of million 
in november we completed the sale of  principal amount of senior convertible notes due at a price of of par pursuant to rule a under the securities act of after the discount on the notes and the offering costs we received million in cash 
the notes are convertible into decode common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share 
decode may redeem the notes beginning april  the notes have the same interest rate and initial conversion price as the existing senior convertible notes due issued in april and otherwise have substantially similar terms 
revenue revenue for the years ended december   and is as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except revenue our business strategy is focused on turning our discoveries into new drugs and diagnostics for the treatment of common diseases 
at the same time  we leverage our capabilities to generate revenue through corporate alliances  through service contracts and increasingly through research grants 
in the majority of our programs we are pursuing drug development on our own 
in certain others  we have formed alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms through which we can cover some of the cost of conducting basic research and spread the risk and investment involved in product development 
increasingly  we have also sought and received research grant funding 
we have entered into research  development  commercialization  and fee for service alliances and contracts across our business 
depending on the nature of each prospective business opportunity  the key components of the commercial terms of such arrangements typically include one or more of the following research funding  up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees  fees for particular services  milestone payments  license or commercialization fees  and royalties or profit sharing from the commercialization of products 
collaborations with our most significant partners include f 
hoffmann la roche roche therapeutics 
in  we entered into an agreement with roche to collaborate on four diseases that had been the subject of an earlier collaboration with roche 
during and through january  we collaborated with roche on two of those diseases 
under this agreement we discovered genes linked to diabetes and roche continues drug discovery based on one of these discoveries 
under the agreement  which expired on february   we received million in research funding and we are entitled to receive royalties on the sales of any drugs that are developed coming out of work conducted under this agreement 
in november  we signed a new three year agreement with roche to co develop inhibitors of pde for the prevention and treatment of vascular disease  including stroke 
this agreement continues work advanced under the agreement  and we will focus on optimizing lead compounds identified under the previous agreement and beginning clinical development 
under this agreement  as of the end of  we received million of research funding 
we will share drug discovery and clinical trials costs under this new agreement  and we may receive an additional million of research funding over the remaining term of the agreement as well as milestone payments and royalties based on drug sales 
diagnostics 
in june  we signed a five year alliance with roche s diagnostics division and through june we collaborated to develop and market dna based diagnostics for major diseases 
during the term of the alliance  which has now expired  we received million in research funding  up front fees and milestone payments under the agreement and we may receive additional milestone payments upon the achievement of research and development milestones by roche and royalties on the sales of diagnostic products developed by roche 
revenues from these alliances with roche amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs incurred with these collaborative programs with roche amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
merck co  inc merck obesity 
in september  we entered into a three year alliance with merck aimed at developing new treatments for obesity 
under the alliance  we combined research efforts with merck in the genetics of obesity to identify  validate and prioritize a series of drug targets to take into development 
during the three year research program  which has now expired  we have received research funding  technology access fees and milestone payments in the aggregate amount of million 
in addition  we may receive further technology access fees in the total aggregate amount of million 
subject to merck s developing products based on collaboration discoveries  we may also receive development milestones and royalties 
we have discovered three genes linked to obesity under this alliance  and merck has generated a lead series of compounds against one of the targets we validated through our genetics research 
revenues from this alliance with merck amounted million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs incurred in connection with this alliance with merck amounted to  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
information rich clinical trials 
in february  we entered into an agreement with merck which provides that decode will conduct information rich clinical trials on a range of merck s developmental compounds that merck selects for inclusion in the program 
the term of the alliance is seven years  subject to termination by merck after five years 
the collaboration involved three agreements a a license and research collaboration agreement  b a stock and warrant purchase agreement  and c a warrant agreement 
under the terms of the license and research collaboration agreement  we will receive royalties on sales of drugs and diagnostics developed as part of the alliance  will receive milestone payments as compounds or pharmacogenomic tests reach the market  will receive research funding for the clinical development of compounds and pharmacogenomic analysis  and received a one time technology access fee of million 
a contingency clause on the technology access fee provides that if decode rejects the first two non exclusive development compounds that merck presents to the collaboration  then merck has the right to request a refund of  of the technology access fee 
the remaining amount of the technology access fee is non refundable 
to date  merck has not selected any compounds for development under the agreement 
revenues from this alliance with merck amounted to  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs incurred in connection with this alliance with merck amounted to  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
government research contracts and grant funding we have received various research grants from divisions of the united states national institutes of health nih  the commission of the european communities ec and other government agencies and private foundations 
research grants for multiple years are based on approved budgets with budgeted amounts subject to approval on an annual basis 
nih grants generally provide for reimbursement of allowable expenditures while grants under the ec generally provides for fifty percent reimbursement of allowable research and development related expenditures 
our significant research contracts include national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases niaid 
in september  decode was awarded a five year  contract by the niaid  a division of nih 
under the contract  decode will apply its population approach and resources to discover genetic factors associated with susceptibility to certain infectious diseases and with responsiveness to vaccines targeting such diseases 
decode may receive million in additional research funding over the remaining term of the agreement 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized revenue of million  million and million from research grants 
costs incurred with research grants amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
significant elements of our revenue are summarized as follows for the year ended december  in thousands research funding and service fees milestone payments up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees government research contracts and grant funding other our revenue for the periods presented generally reflects our strategic focus on proprietary drug discovery and development  including that performed under contracts and grants with the nih and ec  and also a shift away from corporate funded research broadly 
the decline in revenue in is due principally to lower alliance revenues  principally on account of the completion of the merck obesity research program in and the more recent completion of research funding under the agreement with roche june 
at december  we had million in deferred revenue  compared to million at the close of the of this deferred revenue  million relates to our agreement with merck to conduct information rich clinical trials in iceland and  to date  merck has not selected any compounds for development under the agreement 
we expect that our revenues will fluctuate from period to period and that such fluctuations may be substantial especially because progress in our scientific work  including milestone payments that are related to progress  can fluctuate between periods 
cost of revenue cost of revenue for the years ended december   and is as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists of the costs of services provided to customers and collaborators and the costs of programs under research contracts and grants  including i the entirety of the costs incurred in connection with programs that have been partnered and on which we receive research funding  ii costs associated with other service fee revenues  and iii the total amount of those costs incurred in connection with discovery and development work performed under research contracts and grants 
at times  we invested in addition to costs covered by research funding received in such collaborative programs and in addition to monies received under research contracts and grants 
increases in our cost of revenue for as compared to are largely on account of i the shift away from corporate funded research broadly  but specifically the completion of the merck obesity research program and more recently the completion of research funding under the agreement with roche  and also ii the growing amount of discovery and development work performed under ongoing contracts and grants with the nih and ec  including those obtained in connection with the acquisition of uvs in january of late  some of the growth in the cost of discovery and development work performed under contracts and grants with the nih and ec is due to the beginnings of our high density  whole genome studies utilizing the illumina snp genotyping platform and our comprehensive population genetics resources in iceland 
further  in we conducted a phase ii trial in asthma for a compound developed by cephalon and we have stepped up our continuing efforts in the pde inhibitor program for vascular disease stroke pursuant to our agreement with roche 
our cost of revenue for as compared to has increased principally due to the greater usage of chemicals and consumables million primarily related to beginning our high density  whole genome studies  offset somewhat by a decrease in contractor services million and depreciation and amortization million 
also  our cost of revenue for now includes stock based compensation expense under sfas r million 
our cost of revenue  including costs incurred in connection with collaborative programs in as compared to included i an overall decrease in direct salary and employee related expenses million  ii less in chemicals and consumables million  which drove iii lower allocation of overheads million and depreciation and amortization million and also an increase in contractor services million 
the lower depreciation and amortization was also due to the sale leaseback of our facilities in iceland during which reduced our depreciation expense 
research and development research and development for the years ended december   and is as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except research and development the increase in our research and development expenses results from our emphasis on and increasing expenditures in product development  including pre clinical and clinical work on our lead drug discovery and development programs and dna diagnostics 
in may  we began a phase iii clinical trial for dg  our lead developmental compound for the prevention of heart attack  and then in october voluntarily suspended the trial in order to address an unexpected formulation problem with the tablets 
in august we began enrolling patients in a phase i clinical trial for dg  our follow on development compound for the prevention of heart attack 
earlier in  we initiated  and have substantially concluded  a phase iia clinical trial for dg  our lead anti platelet compound for the prevention of arterial thrombosis 
additionally  we have progressed proprietary pre clinical programs in stroke  inflammation  obesity and pain  among other indications 
more recently  we have installed the illumina snp genotyping platform and have begun our high density  whole genome studies utilizing the platform together with our comprehensive population genetics resources in iceland 
based upon the range of our current research and development activities but excluding any significant new collaborations  we believe that our overall investment in research and development for the fiscal year may be in the range of to million 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and consist of the following salaries and other personnel costs materials and supplies contractor services and other third party costs overhead expenses depreciation and amortization stock based compensation increases in research and development costs of our proprietary programs eg  contractor services and other third party costs  salaries and related costs  and usage of materials and supplies may continue  particularly as we advance our clinical development and proprietary drug development programs 
however  we have voluntarily suspended our phase iii clinical trial for dg and are beginning re formulation work 
this suspension may serve to reduce the rate of acceleration of the increases in our research and development costs  and even reduce the overall cost of our research and development expenses as we enter into additionally  in we began our high density  whole genome studies utilizing the illumina snp genotyping platform  we granted salary increases to our personnel and during added clinical development executives to our staff  actions which would generally contribute to future increases in our research and development costs 
further  our cost of research and development for proprietary programs in now also includes stock based compensation expense under sfas r 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except selling  general and administrative increases in our selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to is the result principally of legal fees incurred in relation to our lawsuit to protect intellectual property million 
in addition  our selling  general and administrative expenses include a million gain on the sale of property 
further  our selling  general and administrative expense now also includes stock based compensation expense under sfas r million 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to were essentially unchanged  with relatively small increase in some cost categories offset with decreases in other cost categories but with no general or specific trend thereof 
interest income interest income for the years ended december   and is as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except interest income our interest income has increased in as compared to and our interest income is a function of both the balance of our cash and investments which generally have been declining as resources are deployed in operations but then added to with two financing campaigns in and the rate of return we are able to garner under our investment policy which average rate of return has been increasing in 
we expect to use our cash and investments principally for advancing our discovery and development programs 
in the meantime  we will invest the monies received in accordance with our policy  having the objective of preserving principal and maintaining a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtaining competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
we expect to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including auction rate securities  commercial paper  money market funds  mutual fund investments and government and non government debt securities 
interest expense interest expense for the years ended december   and is as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except interest expense our interest expense has increased in as compared to and decreased as compared to our interest expense is primarily attributable to interest on our senior convertible notes due in that we issued in april million of principal at a full par price and then again in november a further million of principal at a price of of par 
with the additional million of notes added in  our future cash interest payments will be approximately million on an annual basis for the senior convertible notes 
taking into account also the accretion of the discount of the notes and the amortization of offering costs  our total interest expense related to the senior convertible notes is expected to be approximately million for other non operating income and expense  net other non operating income and expense for the years ended december   and is as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except other non operating income and expense  net our other non operating income and expense  includes the net impact of foreign exchange in in and other non operating income and expense  net consists of the net impact of foreign exchange  unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments and  in  loss on early extinguishment of debt and a realized loss on the sale of investments 
as a consequence of the nature of our business and operations  our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
the net impact of foreign exchange on the translated amount of our non us dollar denominated liabilities  net together with transaction gains and losses  amounted to a gain loss of million  million and million in  and  respectively our losses on derivative financial instruments in million resulted from three forward foreign currency exchange options we entered into as economic hedges against foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our isk denominated operating expenses but that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
our losses on derivative financial instruments in stem from the two cross currency swaps we entered into as economic hedges against foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our foreign currency debt but that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
in march  we liquidated our two cross currency swaps receiving million in proceeds 
we realized a loss on this early termination that  together with unrealized losses on the swaps during the  amounted to million 
as a result of having prepaid the short and long term debts that were secured by mortgages on sturlugata we recorded a loss on early extinguishment debt during amounting to million and consisting of i prepayment fees million  ii write off of remaining unamortized finance costs million  and iii remaining unamortized discount on the long term debt million 
in december  we sold investments and realized a loss on the sale of million 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funding from research and development collaborative agreements  and the issuance of equity securities and long term financing instruments million from the beginning of to date 
future funding under terms of our existing agreements is approximately million excluding milestone payments  royalties and other payments that we may earn under such collaborations 
of the million  approximately million is expected to be received in  with the remaining amount due through we make significant investments in proprietary research and development and we incur the costs of such activities 
in the near term  this requires us to devote resources to our in house drug and clinical development which we believe will better position us to capture the most value to us in our discoveries 
as we identify promising discoveries for further development  we may choose to continue the development ourselves into and through clinical trials  regulatory approvals  manufacturing  distribution and marketing 
in other cases we are or will be working to varying degrees with partners 
the decisions we make as to these matters will affect our cash requirements 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including the level and timing of our research and development expenditures  our ability to access the capital markets  to obtain new research and development collaboration agreements  to obtain and maintain contract service agreements in our pharmaceuticals  biostructures  clinical research trials and genotyping service groups  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the purchase of additional capital equipment  and capital expenditures at our facilities 
changes in our research and development plans  notably the entry into clinical trials of drugs based on our discoveries  or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
excluding any significant new alliances or financing activities  we believe that our overall use of cash resources in may be in the range of to million 
as we advance and broaden our drug development pipeline we will require significant additional capital for product development and so we will continue to investigate additional avenues of financing  such as further public or private equity offerings  additional debt financing  other forms of financing or added collaborations and licensing arrangements 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing or collaborations and licensing arrangements will be available when needed  or that if available  will be obtained on favorable terms 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we may have to curtail operations or attempt to raise funds on unattractive terms 
for the year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash and cash equivalents  at end of period cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
together with our investments at december  million  this balance million is million less than at december  significant cash flows during the year ended december  include  the net proceeds from the sale of senior convertible debt million  net proceeds from the sale of million shares of our common stock million  capital expenditures million  the net proceeds from the sale and leaseback financing of equipment and other equipment financings million and costs associated with the advancement of our drug development programs as reflected in the million of cash we used in operating activities during the year ended december  available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy having primary objectives of liquidity and safety of principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our cash is deposited only with financial institutions in iceland  the united kingdom and the united states having a high credit standing a a or better 
we expect to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including auction rate securities commercial paper  money market funds  mutual fund investments and government and non government debt securities 
at december   our cash is largely invested in us dollar denominated money market and checking accounts and also in icelandic krona denominated accounts 
at december   our investments are in auction rate securities  a municipal bond  us government securities and a corporate bond 
operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as more fully described above  the increase in use of cash in operating activities is most importantly attributable to the significant research and development investments being made in advancing our drug and clinical development programs 
the balance of our deferred revenue has decreased during as we recognize revenue as work progresses under collaborative contracts with significant up front monies paid 
investing activities 
our investing activities have consisted of short term investments in marketable securities consisting mainly of auction rate securities  us government securities and in an intermediate term bond mutual fund and capital expenditures 
additionally  in  we purchased uvs and  in doing so  we acquired million of cash to be used to fund the acquired liabilities of uvs 
also  in we completed the sale and leaseback of our reykjavik  iceland facilities at sturlugata and krokhals d and e 
in july  we commenced installation of illumina snp genotyping platform and financed the equipment purchased million with a thee year capital lease with an icelandic financial institution 
with the exception of the illumina equipment purchase  we principally made replacement capital expenditures during  and and invested in certain computer and laboratory equipment 
we have experienced an increase in the pace of necessary capital expenditures and this trend may continue 
although we believe we will continue to make largely replacement capital expenditures in the near term  net cash used in investing activities may in the future fluctuate significantly from period to period due to timing of our capital expenditures and other investments as well as changing business needs 
financing activities 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities in the year ended december   as compared to million that was used in the year ended december  and million that was provided in the year ended december  more significant financing activities for the year ended december   include our sale of  principal amount of senior convertible notes due at a price of of par netting million  our sale of  shares of common stock netting million  the sale and leaseback of illumina and other equipment and proceeds from other equipment financings million and debt service million 
financing activities for the year ended december  largely consisted of prepayments of short and long term debts secured by mortgages on sturlugata million  prepayments of long term debts secured by mortgages on krokhals d and e million refinancing of the mortgage on our woodridge  il facility million which freed up million of previously restricted cash reflected above in investing activities  the sale and leaseback of certain equipment million and other debt service million 
in february  we entered into an agreement regarding the sale and leaseback of our property land and facility in woodridge  illinois 
pursuant to the agreement and subject to the satisfaction of contingencies including  without limitation  negotiation of a satisfactory lease  we will sell the woodridge property for  in cash and lease the property back under a year lease at an initial rent of  per month  subject to annual rent increases of 
under the lease contemplated by the agreement  we will have two year renewal options with rent at the then prevailing market rate 
the lease will be an absolute net lease and we will continue to pay all expenses relating to the property  including taxes  utilities  insurance and maintenance 
our obligations under the lease are to be secured by a letter of credit in the amount of  the agreement regarding the sale and leaseback of the property is subject to the satisfaction of various contingencies  including  without limitation  the negotiation of a satisfactory lease  the buyer s ability to obtain financing for its purchase of the property and the buyer s satisfaction with its due diligence review of the property 
the transaction is expected to close in may if such contingencies are satisfied  however  in light of the contingencies  there can be no assurance that the closing will occur 
contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period total less than year years years years years more than years in thousands senior convertible notes  including interest long term debt  including interest capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases total balance includes a  mortgage loan at december   which has a variable interest rate of libor at december  
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in the interest rate would result in an increase of our interest payments related to this amount of approximately million per year 
balance includes  of icelandic krona isk denominated lease obligations which are variable based on the exchange rate of the isk versus the us dollar and also this amount is subject to periodic adjustments based on the icelandic consumer price index icpi 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the isk and us dollar exchange rate would result in an increase or decrease of our annual lease payments of million 
a hypothetical basis point increase of the icpi would result in an increase or decrease of our annual lease payments of million 
under the terms of certain technology licensing agreements  decode is obligated to make payments upon the achievement of established milestones leading to the discovery of defined products 
these payments could total million  with the timing of payments not determinable at the current time 
these potential payments are not included in the above table 
all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
we do not have any other significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
additionally  holders of our senior convertible notes may elect to convert their notes into shares of our common stock at any time at a price of per share 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  which include  among others  those related to revenue recognition  property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  materials and supplies  derivative financial instruments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the impact and any associated risks related to these and our other accounting policies on our business or operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please refer to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from the estimates referred to above 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
collaborations and revenue our collaborative arrangements and the recognition of revenue in such arrangements is the accounting policy most critical to us 
a substantial portion of our revenues relate to funded research collaborations 
our revenues from research and development collaboration agreements are recorded and recognized in accordance with the applicable performance requirements and terms of the respective contracts  generally either i as contract research costs are incurred  usually ratably over the period of effort  ii according to the level of efforts expended based on the ratio of contract research costs incurred to expected total costs  or iii upon the achievement of substantive milestones 
our accounting recognition policies with respect to each significant element of our revenue is summarized as follows research funding and other service fees 
research funding is recognized as earned  typically ratably over the period of effort 
funding payments are not refundable in the event that the related efforts are not successful 
other service revenues from negotiated rate contracts are recognized based upon the terms of the underlying contract generally either i on a per diem basis as services are rendered  ii on the basis of efforts expended  generally upon the ratio of costs incurred to total expected costs of providing the service  or iii upon completion of the service rendered 
any losses on contracts are provided for when they are determinable 
included in revenue are billings to customers for the cost of materials purchased by decode 
milestone payments 
under the substantive milestone method decode records revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and decode recognizes revenue when acknowledgement of achievement of applicable performance requirements is received from the collaborator 
milestone payments without the above characteristics are recognized on a retrospective basis over the contractual term of the underlying agreement 
in arrangements with multiple elements  if the milestone is substantive in nature and there is uncertainty in the achievement of the milestone and there is no further obligation on the part of decode  decode records revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and decode recognizes revenue when acknowledgement of achievement of applicable performance requirements is received from the collaborator milestone payment method 
if the milestone is earned and there is further obligation under the contract for performance by decode  then decode will record revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and decode retroactively recognizes revenue through the current period based on the total contractual term and amortizes the balance over the remaining contractual term 
up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees 
we recognize revenue from non refundable fees not specifically tied to a separate earnings process ratably over the expected customer relationship period or estimated period of performance 
changes in estimates could impact revenue in the period the estimate is changed 
if our estimate of the period of performance shortens or lengthens  the amount of revenue we recognize from such non refundable fees not specifically tied to a separate earnings process could increase or decrease in the period the change in estimate becomes known  future related revenues would be adjusted accordingly 
revenue estimates are reviewed and revised throughout the lives of our contracts and are made based upon current facts and circumstances 
if changes in these estimates or other material adjustments to revenue are identified  the adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions will be recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
long lived assets  goodwill and intangibles we periodically review property and equipment  goodwill and intangibles for potential impairments and to assess whether their service lives have been affected by continued technological change and development 
there were no events in  and that triggered an impairment review nor did our annual review of goodwill indicate any recoverability issues 
should we determine that there has been an impairment of our fixed assets  goodwill or other intangible assets in the future we would suffer an increase to our net loss or a reduction of our net income in the period such a determination is made 
in light of experience and the current technological environment  in we changed certain of our salvage value and useful life estimates for equipment and furniture and fixtures for purposes of depreciation 
these changes in estimates had the effect of increasing depreciation expense in by million 
should we determine that the pace of technological change or other matters dictate that we change the service lives or other estimates inherent in determining the carrying values of our long lived assets  there will be an impact on depreciation expense from the date of the change 
litigation and other contingencies we consider litigation and other claims and potential claims or contingencies in preparing our financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
we maintain accruals for litigation and other contingencies when we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimated 
in doing so  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes with respect to legal and other matters as well as potential of probable losses 
we base our accruals on information available at the time of such determination 
changes or developments in the relevant action or our strategy in such proceedings could materially affect our results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
since the recognition of a loss is dependent upon factors not completely in the control of management  timing of a charge  if any  is difficult to predict with certainty 
share based payments we grant stock options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our and equity incentive plans 
the benefits provided under these plans are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which we adopted effective january  we elected to use the modified prospective application in adopting sfas r and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the adoption date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
our results of operations for the year ended december  were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of our share based compensation awards 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was million 
stock option awards and restricted stock units generally vest over a three to four year period and expense is ratably recognized over those same time periods 
the determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price  as well as the input of other assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected term of stock options and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation expense in the period the actual forfeitures occur or when options vest 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
fin requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority 
if a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition criteria  fin requires the tax position be measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  decode is evaluating the impact of fin on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements and liabilities in interim and annual reporting periods subsequent to initial recognition 
prior to the issuance of sfas  which emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement and not an entity specific measurement  there were different definitions of fair value and limited definitions for applying those definitions under generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas is effective for the company on a prospective basis for the reporting period beginning january  decode is evaluating the impact of sfas on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in february the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
expands opportunities to use fair value measurement in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  decode has not decided if it will early adopt sfas or if it will choose to measure any eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab which provides guidance on quantifying and evaluating the materiality of unrecorded misstatements 
sab was effective for fiscal years ending after november  sab did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made primarily in high grade corporate bonds  asset backed debt securities and us government agency debt securities 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  due to the nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s convertible notes  because they bear interest at a fixed rate 
the market value of the senior convertible notes was approximately million on december  as a consequence of the nature our business and operations our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
we continue to monitor our exposure to currency risk 
a hypothetical decrease in value of the us dollar against the icelandic krona would result in a loss of approximately million on our icelandic krona denominated non us dollar assets and liabilities 
we have historically purchased instruments to hedge these general risks through the use of derivative financial instruments  however  we have no derivative instruments outstanding as of december  as of december  we did not have any financing arrangements that were not reflected in our balance sheet
