infinity follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
see organization and summary of significant accounting policies  included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
infinity and its operating subsidiaries infinity texas and infinity wyoming are engaged in identifying and acquiring oil and gas acreage  exploring and developing acquired acreage and oil and gas production  with a focus on the acquisition  exploration and development of and production from its properties in the fort worth basin of north central texas and greater green river  sand wash and piceance basins of southwest wyoming and northwest colorado 
infinity has also been awarded a million acre concession offshore nicaragua in the caribbean sea  which it intends to explore over the next few years 
on december   infinity sold its oilfield services business for approximately million 
infinity has reflected the results its oilfield services business as discontinued operations in its statements of operations and balance sheet 
the company s discussion in management s discussion and analysis is presented on a continuing operations basis 
infinity  through infinity texas  continued its exploration and production operations in the fort worth basin of texas during the year ended december  infinity texas successfully drilled ten horizontal and four vertical exploratory wells during as such  infinity significantly increased natural gas production from infinity texas during as compared to infinity texas operations benefit from year round access to exploration and development locations  ease of permitting  better weather  and less restrictive government and environmental laws and regulations 
meanwhile  infinity wyoming continued to explore and develop the various projects and prospects in the rocky mountain region  but continues to be hampered by weather  governmental and environmental restrictions and regulations  as well as various operational issues at the labarge  pipeline and sand wash fields 
infinity expects to continue to explore and develop its fort worth basin acreage and its rocky mountain prospects 
infinity expects its rocky mountain projects to proceed more slowly  due in part to governmental restrictions 
infinity raised incremental debt and equity capital to fund its exploration operations from the net proceeds from the sale of senior secured notes and from the proceeds of option and warrant exercises during in addition to expected increases in cash flows from operating activities  infinity will likely require external financing during and beyond to fund its exploration operations 
the type  timing  cost and amounts of such financing  if any  will depend upon general energy and capital markets conditions and the success of infinity s operations 

table of contents the company engaged netherland  sewell associates  inc to prepare its december   and third party reserve evaluations 
results of these evaluations are disclosed in the supplemental oil and gas disclosures in infinity s consolidated financial statements and in the oil and natural gas reserves section of item and item business and properties 
the following table sets forth infinity s production and other financial data for the years ended december   and production natural gas mmcf oil thousands of barrels total mmcfe financial data in thousands total revenue production expenses production taxes financial data per mcfe total revenue production expenses production taxes under full cost accounting rules  infinity reviews  on a quarterly basis  the carrying value of its oil and gas properties 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future revenue at the prices in effect as of the end of each fiscal quarter  and a write down for accounting purposes is required if the ceiling is exceeded 
during the first nine months of  the company recognized aggregate ceiling writedowns of  as a result of the carrying amount of oil and gas properties subject to amortization exceeding the full cost ceiling limitation 
at december   the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by approximately  based upon a natural gas price of approximately per mcf and an oil price of approximately per barrel in effect at that date 
however  based on subsequent pricing of approximately per mcf of gas and approximately per barrel of oil at the march  measurement date  the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by approximately  therefore  the company recorded an additional ceiling writedown of  at december  in and  the company also recorded ceiling writedowns of  and  respectively 
a decline in prices received for oil and gas sales or an increase in operating costs subsequent to the measurement date or reductions in estimated economically recoverable quantities could result in the recognition of additional ceiling write downs of oil and gas properties in future periods 
operational and financial objectives infinity wyoming plans to focus on optimizing production from existing wells and the advancement of its prospects through additional geological and geophysical analysis 
infinity wyoming anticipates capital expenditures will be approximately million to million to deepen an oil well  reenter and recomplete a gas well previously abandoned by another operator  conduct additional geological and geophysical analysis  and increase its acreage positions 
infinity texas plans to focus on increasing its production and acreage position in the fort worth basin of central texas 
infinity texas anticipates its capital expenditures will be approximately million to million to drill between and wells  complete one vertical well awaiting completion at december   conduct additional geological and geophysical analysis on its acreage and acquire additional acreage 
the company s ability to complete these activities is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to the availability of the capital resources required to fund the activity  
table of contents the availability of third party contractors for drilling rigs and completion services although the company has one rig under contract and operating in texas  and the approval by regulatory agencies of applications for permits to conduct exploration activities in a timely manner 
corporate activities infinity plans to conduct an environmental study and the development of geological information from reprocessing and additional evaluation of existing d seismic data to be acquired over its perlas and tyra concession blocks offshore nicaragua 
infinity has issued letters of credit of approximately  for this initial work on the leases 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  on december   infinity sold its oilfield services business for approximately million 
infinity has reflected the results its oilfield services business as discontinued operations in its statements of operations and balance sheet 
the company s discussion of its results of operations is presented on a continuing operations basis 
net loss infinity incurred a net loss after taxes of million  or 
per diluted share  in compared to a net loss after taxes of million  or per diluted share  in the change between periods was the result of the items discussed below 
revenue infinity achieved total oil and gas revenue of million in compared to million in the increase in oil and gas revenue was the result of improved price realizations combined with higher oil and natural gas sales volumes 
the increase in sales volumes was due primarily to successful developmental drilling in the sand wash basin in northwest colorado and successful exploratory drilling in the fort worth basin 
production expenses oil and gas production expenses increased to million  or per mcfe  during  from million  or per mcfe  in the prior year 
the increase in production expenses during was attributable to a full year of costs incurred at the company s sand wash basin property  which began producing in march  and fort worth basin properties  which began producing in the second quarter of the increase in production cost on a per mcfe basis was the result of a year over year increase in oilfield services costs 
production taxes oil and gas production taxes for decreased slightly to million from million in as a result of a decrease in production from the pipeline field located in wyoming where production taxes are higher than the company s other producing locations 
in addition  oil and gas production taxes for include a credit of approximately  recorded in the period to reflect estimated refunds of production taxes paid in prior periods 
the estimated refunds result from the june designation of the barnett shale in erath county  texas as an area eligible for a reduced production tax rate 
as a result of this designation  the company reflects the payments of severance tax for the eligible wells as a prepayment rather than as production tax expense 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for  from million in the prior year 
the increase was largely due to costs associated with the company s efforts to refinance its debt in the period  
table of contents an increase in personnel and personnel related costs and stock based compensation expense recorded during the period 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion infinity recognized depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion dd a expense of approximately million during  an increase of approximately million compared to dd a expense of approximately million in the prior year 
the increase in dd a expense was due to an increase in finding costs associated with the company s exploration and development program and increased oil and gas production 
ceiling write down during the first nine months of  the company recognized aggregate ceiling writedowns of  as a result of the carrying amount of oil and gas properties subject to amortization exceeding the full cost ceiling limitation 
at december   the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by approximately  based upon a natural gas price of approximately per mcf and an oil price of approximately per barrel in effect at that date 
however  based on subsequent pricing of approximately per mcf of gas and approximately per barrel of oil at the march  measurement date  the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by approximately  therefore  the company recorded an additional ceiling writedown of  at december  at december   the carrying amount of the company s oil and gas properties subject to amortization exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by approximately  based upon an average natural gas price of per mcf and an average oil price of per barrel in effect at that date 
other income expense other income and expense was a net expense of million in compared to a net expense of million in the prior year 
the change of million was principally due to i a million increase in interest expense due to an increase in average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates during  ii million of additional amortization costs resulting from higher debt issuance costs recorded in connection with the company s issuance of senior secured notes in and  and iii million of additional early extinguishment of debt expense resulting from amendments to and repayment of the company s senior secured notes  partially offset by a million increase in income resulting from the decrease in the fair value of derivative liabilities 
income tax infinity reflected no net tax benefit or expense from continuing operations in and the net operating losses generated in those periods increased infinity s net deferred tax asset 
included in gain on sale of discontinued operations for is million of estimated alternative minimum taxes 
due to uncertainty as to the ultimate utilization of the company s net deferred tax asset  as of december  and  the company recorded a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset 
discontinued operations on december   the company completed the sale of its oilfield services subsidiaries for approximately million in cash 
in connection with the sale  the company recognized a gain of  net of taxes of million 
results from the company s oilfield subsidiaries are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods 
included in income from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and are revenues of  and  respectively 

table of contents results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net loss infinity incurred a net loss after taxes of million  or per diluted share  in compared to a net loss after taxes of million  or per diluted share  in the change between periods was the result of the items discussed below 
revenue infinity achieved total oil and gas revenue of million in compared to million in the increase in oil and gas revenue was the result of improved price realizations for both oil and gas combined with higher oil sales volumes  partially offset by lower gas sales volumes 
the increase in oil sales volumes was due primarily to successful developmental drilling in the sand wash basin in northwest colorado 
declines in gas sales volumes from the company s pipeline field were partially offset by new production from exploratory drilling in the fort worth basin 
production expenses oil and gas production expenses increased to million  or per mcfe  during  from million  or per mcfe  in the prior year 
the increase in production expenses was attributable to costs incurred at the company s sand wash basin property  which began producing in march  and fort worth basin properties  which began producing in the second quarter of the increase in production cost on a per mcfe basis was the result of the increase in production from the company s sand wash basin oil property  which has higher operating costs 
production taxes oil and gas production taxes for increased to 
million from million in as a result of the increase in revenue discussed above 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for  from million in the prior year 
the increase was largely due to an increase in personnel and personnel related costs  costs associated with the company s sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and increased cost of being incorporated in delaware  partially offset by an increase in capitalized general and administrative expenses in as a result of increased drilling and acquisition activity 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion infinity recognized depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion dd a expense of approximately million during  an increase of approximately million compared to dd a expense of approximately million in the prior year 
the increase in dd a expense was due to an increase in finding costs associated with the company s exploration and development program and increased oil and gas production 
ceiling write down at december   the carrying amount of the company s oil and gas properties subject to amortization exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by approximately  based upon an average natural gas price of per mcf and an average oil price of per barrel in effect at that date 
at december   the carrying amount of the company s oil and gas properties subject to amortization exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by approximately  based upon an average natural gas price of per mcf and an average oil price of per barrel in effect at that date 
however  due to subsequent price increases to approximately per mcf of gas and per barrel of oil at the march  measurement date  the company was only required to record a ceiling writedown of  in the quarter and year ended december  
table of contents other income expense other income and expense was a net expense of million in compared to a net expense of million in the prior year 
the change of million was principally due to i a million increase in interest expense due to an increase in average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates during  and ii million of additional early extinguishment of debt expense resulting from additional debt retired during  partially offset by a million decrease in amortization costs resulting from loan costs written off in connection with debt retirement in and million of income resulting from the decrease in the fair value of derivative liabilities see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
income tax infinity reflected no net tax benefit or expense in and the net operating losses generated in those periods increased infinity s net deferred tax asset 
due to uncertainty as to the ultimate utilization of the company s net deferred tax asset  as of december  and  the company recorded a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset  as further described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations on december   the company completed the sale of its oilfield services subsidiaries for approximately million in cash 
results from the company s oilfield subsidiaries are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods 
included in income from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and are revenues of  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources infinity s primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and debt and equity financings 
infinity s primary needs for cash are for the operation  development  production  exploration and acquisition of oil and gas properties and for fulfillment of working capital obligations 
as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of million  compared to a working capital surplus of million at december  excluding current assets and liabilities of discontinued operations at december   the company would have had a working capital deficit at december  of million 
the million change in working capital excluding the effects of current assets and liabilities of discontinued operations is largely the result of a significant increase in vendor payables incurred and cash used in connection with the company s drilling program 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to improved gross profit  partially offset by increased interest expense and cash expenses paid in connection with early extinguishment of debt 
during  cash provided by investing activities was million  compared to million used in excluding net proceeds of million from the sale of the company s oilfield services business  cash used in investing activities during was million 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities of million was primarily attributable to a million decrease in exploration and development capital expenditures resulting from the suspension of exploration and development activities in mid  partially offset by an increase of million in oilfield services capital expenditures 
during  cash used in financing activities was million  compared to million provided by financing activities during the net change of million was principally due to the repayment of a net million of debt during including million of increased principal resulting from covenant violations under the company s then outstanding senior secured notes compared to net debt proceeds of million 
table of contents received in and proceeds from issuance of common stock of million  partially offset by million of debt and equity issuance costs incurred in on december   infinity completed the sale of its oilfield services subsidiaries  consolidated oil well services  inc and cis oklahoma  inc for approximately million in cash 
infinity s former oilfield services business is reported as a discontinued operation in the accompanying statements of operations and balance sheets  however  cash flows from the former oilfield services business are not reflected separately in the accompanying statements of cash flows 
the following table quantifies cash flows from the discontinued operation by category in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities historically  a significant portion of cash flows from infinity s former oilfield services business was used to fund corporate overhead  debt service or interest and a portion of infinity s oil and gas exploration and development activities 
the absence of such cash flows is expected to increase the overall debt required by infinity to fund such activities in the future 
infinity used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its oilfield services business to repay the outstanding principal amount of notes and accrued interest on its former senior secured notes facility and terminate the facility 
on january   infinity entered into a million reserve based revolving credit facility the credit facility with amegy bank na amegy 
under the terms of the credit facility  infinity may borrow  repay and re borrow on a revolving basis up to the lesser of i the aggregate sums permitted under the borrowing base  initially set at million  or ii million 
at closing  infinity borrowed million under the credit facility  which was used to settle past due trade payables  fund working capital needs and pay expenses of the financing transaction 
additional amounts borrowed under the facility may be used to fund the plan of development agreed to by infinity and amegy 
the credit facility has an initial term of two years 
amounts borrowed bear interest at graduated variable rates based on libor or the prime rate  which rates shall be adjusted based on the percentage of the applicable borrowing base used by infinity from time to time 
libor rates can range between libor plus and libor plus  and prime rates can range between prime and prime plus 
interest payments are due on a monthly basis and principal payments may be required under the credit facility to meet a borrowing base deficiency or monthly borrowing commitment reductions 
the borrowing base under the credit facility and the applicable interest rate are subject to adjustment at least once every six months 
outstanding balances are secured by substantially all of the assets of infinity and its subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains certain standard continuing covenants and agreements and requires infinity to maintain certain financial ratios and thresholds 
under the credit facility  infinity is subject to certain limitations with respect to hedging transactions 
in addition  infinity was required to enter into certain hedging transactions covering in the aggregate at least seventy percent of anticipated production from its proved developed producing oil and gas properties 
outlook for the company has retained an investment bank to explore its strategic alternatives  including a sale of some or all of its assets 
the company and its investment bank are actively engaged in discussions with numerous parties regarding its strategic alternatives 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these discussions  whether a transaction might be consummated  or the potential impact of such a transaction on the company s stockholders 
depending on the results of infinity s exploration of strategic alternatives  the availability of capital resources  the availability of third party contractors for drilling and completion services  and satisfaction of regulatory activities  infinity could incur capital expenditures of approximately million to million during approximate capital expenditures by operating entity are anticipated to be million by infinity texas  million 
table of contents by infinity wyoming  and million by infinity energy resources  inc the company could also make capital expenditures for acquisitions or accelerated drilling activities in excess of these amounts should appropriate opportunities arise 
the company has a million reserve based revolving credit facility the credit facility with amegy bank na amegy  under which infinity may borrow  repay and re borrow on a revolving basis up to the lesser of i the aggregate sums permitted under the borrowing base  initially set at million  or ii million 
as of march   the company had drawn million under the credit facility  and has million available to fund budgeted capital expenditures under the approved plan of development under the credit facility 
the credit facility has an initial term of two years and amounts borrowed bear interest at graduated variable rates based on libor or the prime rate  which rates shall be adjusted based on the percentage of the applicable borrowing base used by infinity from time to time 
libor rates can range between libor plus and libor plus  and prime rates can range between prime and prime plus 
depending on the market price for crude oil and natural gas during  the number of wells ultimately drilled and stabilized production levels from wells expected to be placed on line during  infinity would expect to generate cash flow from operating activities during of between million and million 
in summary  infinity believes that it will have approximately million to million available to it in from external financing  including borrowings under the credit facility  cash from operating activities  and cash collateral of  securing letters of credit related to its nicaraguan concessions to fund its planned capital expenditures of million to million 
should infinity identify acquisition opportunities  or if it wishes to accelerate the exploration and development of its oil and gas properties beyond that currently anticipated  or if cash flow from operating activities is not at levels anticipated  or if infinity is unable to borrow under the credit facility  infinity may seek the forward sale of oil and gas production  partnerships or strategic alliances for the development of its undeveloped acreage  the public or private offering of common or preferred equity or subordinated debt  asset sales  or other joint interest or joint venture opportunities to fund any cash shortfalls  or  because infinity s planned capital expenditures are largely discretionary  infinity could decrease the level of its planned capital expenditures 
critical estimates following is a discussion of estimates used in the preparation of infinity s financial statements that management deems to be critical in nature because either i the accounting estimate requires the company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates could have reasonably been used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or ii in management s judgment changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition or results of operations 
reserve estimates infinity s estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  the company must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production and property taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may  in fact  vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the company s reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  oil and gas reserves are used throughout infinity s financial statements 
for example  since oil and gas properties are depleted using the units of production method  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact dd a expense 
in addition  oil and gas properties are subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for supplemental oil and gas disclosures 

table of contents unproved properties on a quarterly basis  the costs of unproved properties are evaluated for inclusion in the costs to be amortized resulting from the determination of proved reserves  impairments  or reductions in value 
to the extent that the evaluation indicates these properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
abandonments of unproved properties are accounted for as an adjustment to capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties  with no losses recognized 
fair value of derivatives the company records all derivative instruments assets or liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting and  if so  whether the derivative is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge 
changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for fair value hedges  to the extent the hedge is effective there is no effect on the statement of operations  because changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
the company periodically hedges a portion of its oil and gas production through swap and collar agreements 
the purpose of the hedges is to provide a measure of stability to the company s cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage the exposure to commodity price risk 
in addition  the warrants issued with the company s retired senior secured notes are separately accounted for as freestanding derivatives at estimated fair value 
the estimated fair values of the company s derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
the determination of fair value includes significant estimates by management including the term of the instruments  volatility of the price of the company s common stock and interest rates  among other items 
the fluctuations in estimated fair value may be significant from period to period  which  in turn  may have a significant impact on the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
asset retirement obligations the company has obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore locations  primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating future restoration and removal costs  or asset retirement obligations aro  is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments  because most of the removal obligations are several years in the future 
inherent in the calculation of the present value of the company s aro under existing accounting literature are numerous assumptions and judgments  including ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
in addition  increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of tax asset the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial accounting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax benefits of tax loss carryforwards and other deferred taxes recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the value of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  
table of contents as of december  and  management was not able to conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
as such  at december  and  the company recorded a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset 
critical policies the accounting for infinity s business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the full cost method and the successful efforts method 
the differences between the two methods can lead to significant variances in the amounts reported in the company s financial statements 
infinity has elected to follow the full cost method  which is described below 
oil and gas properties  depreciation and full cost ceiling test under the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisition costs  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  the cost of drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  and salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
the capitalized costs are depleted over the life of the reserves associated with the assets  with the depletion expense recognized in the period that the reserves are produced 
this depletion expense is calculated by dividing the period s production volumes by the estimated volume of reserves associated with the investment and multiplying the calculated percentage by the capitalized investment 
the costs of wells in progress and unevaluated properties  including any related capitalized interest  are not amortized 
on a quarterly basis  such costs are evaluated for inclusion in the costs to be amortized resulting from the determination of proved reserves  impairments  or reductions in value 
to the extent that the evaluation indicates these properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
abandonments of unproved properties are accounted for as an adjustment to capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties  with no losses recognized 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the net book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  as adjusted for the effect of cash flow hedges 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment  or non cash writedown  is required 
a ceiling test impairment could cause the company to record a significant non cash loss for a particular period  however  the future depletion  depreciation and amortization rate would be reduced 
in  and  the company recorded ceiling writedowns of   and  respectively 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned  and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  dry holes  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis under the successful efforts method 
impairments are assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
in general  the application of the full cost method of accounting results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to the successful efforts method 
the company follows the full cost method because management believes it appropriately reflects the cost of the company s exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes by period the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total and and thereafter in thousands asset retirement obligations a capital lease operating leases gas gathering commitments b non current production and property taxes total contractual obligations a the table above reflects the company s estimate of the settlement of its asset retirement obligations  however  neither the timing nor the ultimate settlement amounts of such obligations can be determined in advance with any precision 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
b gathering commitments represent minimum estimated gathering fees under a gas gathering contract for gas production from the company s erath county  texas properties  however  the ultimate settlement amounts of these obligations can not be determined in advance with any precision 
the table above does not reflect the obligations associated with a gas gathering and transportation contract related to the company s pipeline field 
while infinity wyoming has failed to deliver the volumes required under the terms of the contract  the pipeline operators have also not provided the compression and gathering capabilities they were required to provide under the contract 
management is currently negotiating revised volume commitments under a lengthened contract with the third party gatherer and processor

 fair value measurements 
the standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
under the standard  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
the standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk infinity s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to infinity s crude oil and natural gas production
