item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive overview the company is a specialty retailer of private branded  sophisticated  casual to dressy clothing  intimates  complementary accessories  and other non clothing gift items operating under the chico s  wh bm  and soma by chico s soma brand names 
chico s  which began operations in  focuses on fashion conscious women who are and over with a moderate to high income level 
the styling interprets fashion trends in a unique  relaxed  figure flattering manner using mainly easy care fabrics 
wh bm  which the company acquired in september  and which began operations in  targets middle to upper income women who are years old and up 
the styling is contemporary  feminine and unique  assorted primarily in the classic and timeless colors of white and black and related shades 
soma was initially launched in august this concept offers foundation products in intimate apparel  sleepwear  and activewear that is aimed at the chico s target customer  but with focus and styling that is expected to ultimately appeal to a broader customer base 
in early fiscal  the company acquired the fitigues brand  which had began its operations in and which was a fitness inspired brand  offering stylish yet comfortable activewear clothing 
during fiscal  the company completed an internal evaluation of the fitigues brand and  in the fourth quarter  decided to close down operations of the fitigues brand 
the company began closing the fitigues brand stores in the first quarter of fiscal the company anticipates all of the remaining fitigues stores at fiscal year end and the website will be shut down by the end of the second quarter of fiscal the company earns revenues and generates cash through the sale of merchandise in its retail stores  to its chico s franchisees  and through its call centers  which handle sales related to the chico s  wh bm  and soma catalog and online operations 
since the company opened its first chico s store in principally selling folk art  its retail store system  now selling principally women s apparel  has grown to stores as of march   including company owned chico s stores  wh bm stores  and soma stores the remaining stores are the fitigues stores that are in the process of being closed 
during fiscal  the company opened net new company owned stores and repurchased one of its franchise stores this number of stores excludes the fitigues stores acquired in early fiscal 
since the beginning of fiscal  the company has reacquired the remaining formerly franchised stores 
those stores are included in the company owned chico s stores as of march  from february  through february   the company opened new company owned stores  acquired stores from a franchisee  and one franchisee opened new franchised stores 
of the new company owned stores  were opened in fiscal  were opened in fiscal  were opened in fiscal net of the former pazo stores that were closed and converted into wh bm stores and soma stores  were opened in fiscal  and were opened in fiscal during this same time period  the company closed company owned stores and no franchised stores were closed 
the company has revised its targeted new store openings for fiscal to include new stores excluding the fitigues planned closures and the stores reacquired from its franchisees 
of this total  are expected to be chico s stores  are expected to be wh bm stores  and are expected to be soma stores 
the company also currently anticipates relocations expansions in fiscal planned square footage growth for fiscal is now estimated to be approximately a to increase in selling square footage  slightly lower than the originally announced goal of a increase 
the primary factors which historically have influenced the company s profitability and success have been its growth in number of stores and selling square footage  its positive comparable store sales  and its strong operating margin 
in the last five years the company has grown from stores as of february  to stores as of february  stores if the fitigues stores slated for closing are excluded  which includes the significant store growth resulting from the acquisition of the wh bm stores in fiscal and the launch of the soma 
table of contents brand in fiscal the company continues to expand its presence through the opening of new stores  the development of new opportunities such as soma and through the extension of its merchandise line 
the company anticipates that its rate of growth measured by overall growth in sales  growth in comparable store sales  and other factors can be expected to decrease from the rate of overall sales growth experienced in recent years which has been in the range of  such anticipated decrease in rate of growth reflecting in large part the company s significantly increased size  its more manageable net square footage growth goal for fiscal  its net square footage growth goal for fiscal and the expectation that its same store sales may continue to experience more moderate and flatter increases and may experience decreases from time to time  as was the case in the second half of fiscal the company generally expects to continue to generate the necessary cash flow to fund its expansion and to take advantage of new opportunities 
the company has no long term debt and foresees no current need to incur long term debt to support its continued growth 
factors that will be critical to determining the company s future success include  among others  managing the overall growth strategy  including the ability to open and operate stores effectively  maximizing efficiencies in the merchandising  product development and sourcing processes  maintaining high standards for customer service and assistance  maintaining newness  fit and comfort in its merchandise offerings  matching merchandise offerings to customer preferences and needs  effectuating customer acceptance of new store concepts  integrating new or acquired businesses  maturing the newer brand concepts  implementing the process of senior management succession  and generating cash to fund the company s expansion needs 
in order to monitor the company s success  the company s senior management monitors certain key performance indicators  including comparable same store sales growth in fiscal  the company s comparable store sales growth sales from stores open for at least twelve full months  including stores that have been expanded or relocated within the same general market was 
however  the overall increase in comparable store sales in fiscal was significantly impacted by single digit declines in comparable store sales beginning in the second half of fiscal the company believes that the decline in comparable store sales for the core chico s brand was principally due to missteps in fashion merchandising  an aggressive store opening relocation expansion program that is believed to have contributed to less than acceptable store service levels and a refocusing in the direction of the company s marketing initiatives 
the company s current strategy is to target a general overall trend towards positive  but more moderate  comparable store sales growth 
the company believes that its ability to realize such a general overall positive trend in comparable store sales will prove to be a key factor in determining its future levels of success i particularly in terms of the company s success in effectively operating its stores across all brands  ii in managing its continuing store expansion program across all brands  and iii in maturing and developing its newer brands 
positive operating cash flow in fiscal  the company generated million of cash flow from operations compared with million in fiscal  which represents an increase of 
the company believes that a key strength of its business is the ability to consistently generate cash flow from operations 
strong cash flow generation is critical to the future success of the company  not only to support the general operating needs of the company  but also to fund capital expenditures related to new store openings  relocations  expansions and remodels  future costs associated with the company s proposed expansions of its existing corporate headquarters and its existing distribution center  any future stock repurchase programs  costs associated with continued improvement of information technology tools  including the conversions to the sap software platform  and costs associated with potential strategic acquisitions that may arise from time to time 
see further discussion of the company s cash flows in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
loyalty clubs and customer development management believes that a significant indicator of the company s success is the extent of the growth of its loyalty programs  the passport club and the black book  and support for such loyalty programs that is provided through its personalized customer service training programs and its marketing initiatives 
the passport club  the chico s and soma frequent shopper club  features discounts and other special promotions for its members 
preliminary members may join the passport club at no cost and  upon spending  customers automatically become permanent members and are entitled to a lifetime discount and other benefits 
the black book loyalty program  the wh bm frequent shopper club  is similar to the passport club in most key respects except that customers become 
table of contents permanent members upon spending  compared to for the passport club 
the company believes that the continued growth in new members and repeat shopping of its existing passport and black book club members indicates that the company is still generating strong interest from its customers due in large part to the company s commitment to personalized customer service and constant newness of product 
active customers are those who have purchased at one of the company s brands within the preceding months 
as of february   the company had approximately million active chico s and soma permanent passport club members and approximately million active preliminary passport club members 
in fiscal  active permanent passport club members accounted for approximately of overall sales  slightly higher than in fiscal  and active preliminary members accounted for approximately of overall sales 
during fiscal  active permanent passport members spent  on average  over more per transaction than did active preliminary members 
as of february   wh bm had approximately million active permanent black book members and approximately million active preliminary black book members 
in fiscal  the active permanent black book members accounted for of overall sales  while active preliminary members accounted for of overall sales 
during fiscal  active permanent black book members spent  on average  over more per transaction than did active preliminary members 
the company believes that the growth and consistency of its passport and black book clubs indicate that the company is still generating strong interest from new and existing customers  many of whom tend to become long term loyal customers  due in large part to the company s commitment to personalized customer service and constant newness of product 
quality and merit of merchandise offerings to monitor and maintain the acceptance of its merchandise offerings  the company monitors sell through levels  inventory turns  gross margins and markdown rates on a classification and style level 
although the company does not disclose these statistics for competitive reasons  this analysis helps identify comfort  fit and newness issues at an early date and helps the company plan future product development and buying 
in addition to the key performance indicators mentioned above  the company s operational strategies are focused on qualitative factors as well 
the company s ability to manage its multiple brands  to develop and grow its newer soma concept  to expand the company s direct to consumer business  to secure new store locations including relocations and or expansions of existing stores and to launch new product categories within all brands  are all important strategies that  if successful  should contribute to the continued growth of the company 
the company continues to evaluate and monitor the progress of its intimate apparel initiative with its soma brand 
the company recognizes that the soma business can be seen as complementary to its basic apparel business  but also understands that many aspects of this business require unique attention 
the company monitors soma merchandise offerings in a manner similar to its other brands with special emphasis on repeat purchases in the foundation category 
the company anticipates that additional investment will be required to establish the soma brand as a suitable business that meets the profitability goals of the company over the longer term 
the company estimates that the soma brand reduced the company s earnings per share by 
for fiscal and the company believes it will reduce fiscal earnings by between 
and 
the company further believes that an impact on earnings per share of this order is acceptable when balanced against the potential of the brand s perceived longer term potential 
in fiscal year  the company reported net sales  operating income and net income of billion  million and million  respectively 
net sales increased by  while operating income and net income decreased by and  respectively  from the prior fiscal year 
the company s gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the gross profit percentage was primarily due to lower merchandise margins at the chico s front line stores due mostly to more extensive markdowns  the mix effect of wh bm and soma sales becoming a larger portion of the company s overall net sales  increased inventory clearance costs and the continued investment in the company s product development teams 
gross profit percentage was also negatively impacted by the portion of the incremental stock based compensation expense included in cost of goods sold  which reduced the gross margin by approximately basis points due to the adoption of sfas r and the related change in accounting for stock based compensation 

table of contents general  administrative and store operating expenses including depreciation and amortization and impairment of goodwill increased as a percentage of net sales over the prior period by approximately basis points primarily due to increased store operating expenses specifically for the chico s brand primarily increases in personnel and occupancy costs attributable mainly to the deleverage associated with the relatively flat comparable store sales in the chico s stores and to the company s planned increase in store payroll as a percentage of sales 
general  administrative and store operating expenses were also impacted by the portion of the incremental stock based compensation expense included in these expenses due to the adoption of sfas r  which had an approximate basis point impact  and the increased occupancy costs  including depreciation and amortization expense due to capital expenditures for new  remodeled and expanded stores  which generally are larger in size than in prior years and consequently require increased capital expense  and  to a lesser extent  from the accelerated depreciation of certain legacy software systems to be replaced in connection with the company s decision to move to the sap software platform 
in addition  the company s results were also impacted by approximately an aggregate of million of impairment related expenses regarding the planned closure of the fitigues brand 
the million  or approximately basis points  consisted primarily of an impairment loss on goodwill totaling million which is shown on a separate line within the consolidated statements of operations  accelerated fixed asset depreciation of million  and other impairment related charges  mainly for inventory  totaling million  with no comparable amounts recorded in the prior period 
sales and profitability trends are further discussed in the results of operations section 
future outlook the company has been carefully reviewing and rethinking its recent practice of providing specific quarterly and annual sales and earnings guidance 
the retail industry is unique in providing monthly sales and comparable store sales data  as well as detailed operational data  for individual brands  which provides interested parties with much greater detail than is presented in the company s financial statements 
therefore  while the company remains committed to maintaining the transparency of its financial reporting  the company will no longer provide specific quarterly or annual sales and earnings guidance  provided  however  that the company does expect to comment on the street consensus estimates from time to time  as it had done in the past and when it believes necessary and appropriate 
in the march  year end earnings release  for example  the company stated that it believed that if it achieved a low single digit same store sales increase on a consolidated basis for fiscal  the current consensus first call estimates at that time for fiscal sales and diluted earnings per share appeared reasonable 
looking forward to fiscal  the company s initial plan contemplates targeting an approximate increase in its selling square footage  which is expected to result from approximately net new stores and relocations and expansions of existing stores 
the preliminary breakdown of new stores by brand for fiscal is as follows chico s stores  wh bm stores  and soma stores 
results of operations net sales the following table shows net sales by company owned chico s soma stores  net sales by company owned wh bm stores  net sales by catalog and internet  and other net sales in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for the fiscal years ended february  fiscal or current period  which consisted of weeks  january  fiscal or prior period  which consisted of weeks and january  fiscal  which consisted of weeks dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales by chico s soma stores net sales by wh bm stores net sales by catalog and internet other net sales net sales 
table of contents net sales by company owned chico s  soma and wh bm stores increased in the current period from the prior period  both in the aggregate and separately by brand  primarily due to new store openings  and to a lesser extent  from the slight overall increase in the company s comparable store net sales 
a summary of the factors impacting year over year sales increases is provided in the table below dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal comparable store sales increases comparable same store sales new store sales increases number of new company owned stores opened  net does not include fitigues stores acquired in fiscal the comparable store sales increase of in fiscal was driven primarily by the increase in comparable store sales at the wh bm stores which resulted primarily from an increase in the number of transactions compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  from an increase of in the wh bm average unit retail price which average unit retail price is a financial indicator  the percentage change of which is believed by management to represent a reasonable approximation of the percentage change in company store net sales attributable to price changes or mix 
the overall comparable store sales increase was offset by an essentially flat comparable store sales result at the chico s and soma stores which resulted primarily from a decrease of in the average unit retail price offset by an increase in the number of transactions 
in fiscal  wh bm same store sales represented approximately of the total same store sales base compared to in fiscal the comparable store sales increase of in fiscal was driven primarily by an increase in the number of transactions compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  from an increase of in the chico s average unit retail price and an increase of in the average unit retail price for wh bm 
wh bm stores were included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning in october  which was full months after the acquisition date of september  for fiscal  wh bm sales prior to october are included in new store sales 
sales from soma stores in fiscal were included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning in september and did not have a material impact on the calculation 
in fiscal  all other sales from soma stores were included in new store sales 
sales from fitigues stores were included in new store sales in fiscal and will be included in discontinued operations in fiscal due to the planned closure of the brand 
net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal which included merchandise from all four of the company s brands increased by million  or  compared to net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal it is believed that the increase was principally attributable to significant increases in wh bm and soma merchandise items available on the website  and to a lesser extent  increases in the chico s merchandise available for sale through the internet and the increased circulation of catalog mailings 
net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal which included mostly chico s and wh bm merchandise and a small offering of soma merchandise increased by million  or  compared to net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal it is believed that the increase was principally attributable to the increased circulation of catalog mailings and additional television spots in fiscal compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  the launch of the wh bm website in august providing wh bm customers with the opportunity to purchase merchandise over the internet and through its catalog 
cost of goods sold gross profit the following table shows cost of goods sold and gross profit in dollars and the related gross profit percentages for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal cost of goods sold gross profit gross profit percentage 
table of contents the decrease in the gross profit percentage from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease of basis points in the merchandise margins at the chico s front line stores and to a lesser extent  due to the mix effect resulting from the wh bm and soma sales becoming a larger portion of the company s overall net sales both wh bm and soma brands operate with lower gross margins than the chico s brand 
the decrease in merchandise margins at the chico s front line stores was primarily due to a higher markdown rate compared to the prior period 
gross profit percentage was also negatively impacted by increased inventory clearance costs and the deleverage associated with the relatively flat comparable store sales in the chico s stores and  to a lesser extent  from the continued investment in the company s product development and merchandising functions and by the recognition of approximately million of incremental stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r and the related change in accounting for stock based compensation  which reduced the gross margin by approximately basis points 
the decrease in the gross profit percentage from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease in the merchandise margins at the company s outlet stores  from the company s continued investment in its soma and wh bm brands  which generate somewhat lower gross margins soma merchandise margins were approximately percentage points lower than the merchandise margins at chico s and wh bm merchandise margins were just under percentage points lower than the merchandise margins at chico s  and to a lesser extent  from the company s continued investment in the product development and merchandising functions for all of its brands as well as from slightly increased inventory clearance costs 
these decreases in gross profit percentage were partially offset by an improvement of approximately basis points in the merchandise margins at wh bm front line stores 
the improvement of merchandise margins at the wh bm front line stores resulted primarily from improved initial markups on new products  moderated in part by a higher markdown rate compared to the prior period 
the gross profit percentage for chico s front line stores improved slightly  approximately basis points  for the current period compared to the prior period primarily due to improved initial markups on new products offset by a higher markdown rate compared to the prior period 
general  administrative and store operating expenses the following table shows general  administrative and store operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal general  administrative and store operating expenses percentage of total net sales the increase in general  administrative and store operating expenses in dollars was  for the most part  the result of increases in the company s store operating expenses  including associate compensation  occupancy and other costs associated with additional store openings and  to a lesser degree  an increase in marketing expenses  the adoption of sfas r and other general corporate infrastructure costs to support the company s growth  including expenses related to housing of off site business units 
general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased basis points in fiscal over the prior period primarily due to increased store operating expenses in the chico s stores primarily personnel and occupancy costs attributable mainly to the larger size stores the company has been opening  an increase in store relocations and expansions  as well as the deleverage associated with the flat comparable store sales in the chico s stores and the company s planned increase in store payroll as a percentage of net sales 
general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales also increased compared to the prior period due to the recognition of approximately million of incremental stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r and the related change in accounting for stock based compensation  or an impact of approximately basis points  when compared to the prior period and to an even lesser extent  by a planned increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of total net sales 
these increases in general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were offset slightly by a reduction in incentive compensation mostly due to the company s lower than anticipated fiscal year results 
general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal decreased basis points over the prior period primarily because there was million of rent expense included in fiscal 
table of contents related to prior fiscal years see further discussion below to adjust the company s presentation of rent expense with no comparable expense in fiscal general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also positively impacted by a significant decrease in wh bm store operating expenses primarily in personnel and occupancy costs as a percentage of total net sales over the prior period resulting from leverage associated with the wh bm comparable store sales increase in the mid to high thirty percent range 
these decreases in general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of total net sales were partially offset by increased incentive compensation as a result of the company s strong financial performance 
in fiscal  general  administrative and store operating expenses were impacted by the company s decision  in connection with a review of its accounting practices relating to leasing transactions  to record a one time  non cash adjustment related to the timing of rent expense for store locations 
previously  the company followed a practice prevalent across the retailing industry  in which it recognized the straight line rent expense for leases beginning generally on the earlier of the store opening date or lease commencement date  which had the effect of excluding the build out period of its stores from the calculation of the period over which it expensed rent 
the company now records rent expense when it takes possession of a store  which occurs before the commencement of the lease term or approximately days prior to the opening of the store 
this adjustment resulted in a one time  cumulative  non cash increase to rent expense of approximately million pre tax 
of the million pre tax expense recorded in fiscal  million was attributable to the current year and million pre tax  was related to prior fiscal years 
furthermore  in fiscal  the company revised the manner in which it accounts for construction allowances from landlords of properties leased by the company for its stores 
for fiscal and for future fiscal years  construction allowances are amortized as a reduction of rent expense  rather than being amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense  which was the approach followed in fiscal years prior to for fiscal  the impact of amortizing construction allowances as a reduction of rent expense rather than as a reduction of depreciation expense resulted in a decrease to rent expense of approximately million 
the net impact of these two lease accounting adjustments was immaterial to general  administrative and store operating expenses in total and as a percentage of total net sales 
depreciation and amortization the following table shows depreciation and amortization in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal depreciation and amortization percentage of total net sales the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total net sales was due primarily to capital expenditures related to new  relocated and expanded stores  which generally are larger in size than in prior years and consequently require an increased capital expense as well as from the deleverage associated with the relatively flat comparable store sales in the chico s stores  and  to a lesser extent  from the accelerated depreciation of certain legacy software systems to be replaced in connection with the company s decision to move to the sap software platform as well as from other newly installed hardware and software packages 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from fiscal to fiscal was  for the most part  due to capital expenditures related to new  relocated and expanded stores 
impairment of goodwill during fiscal  the company acquired most of the assets of fitigues consisting primarily of retail stores and its internet sales operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed its evaluation of the fitigues brand and decided to close down operations of the fitigues brand and  in the first quarter of fiscal  began closing the fitigues brand s stores 
the company anticipates all of the remaining fitigues stores at fiscal year end to be closed and the website to be shut down by the end of the second quarter of fiscal in connection with reaching this decision  the company completed an impairment review of fitigues goodwill and determined 
table of contents that the fair value of the fitigues reporting unit was less than its carrying value  including the existing goodwill 
as a result  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during fiscal the loss on impairment is included as a separate line within income from continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to favorable permanent differences  mainly higher charitable inventory contributions and tax free interest  offset  in part  by a slightly unfavorable change in the company s overall state effective tax rate mainly due to a change in the weight of sales  property and income apportioned to unitary and higher tax jurisdictions 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to favorable permanent differences  including higher tax free interest  as well as a slightly favorable change in the company s overall state effective tax rate 
the company expects that its effective tax rate for fiscal will be flat to slightly favorable compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal net income the following table shows net income in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal net income percentage of total net sales comparable company store net sales comparable store sales for the week period ended february  increased compared to the same week period last year ended february  comparable company store net sales data is calculated based on the change in net sales of currently open company owned stores that have been operated as a company store for at least twelve full months  including stores that have been expanded or relocated within the same general market area approximately five miles 
the comparable store percentage reported above includes stores that were expanded or relocated within the last two fiscal years by an average of  selling square feet 
if the stores that were expanded and relocated had been excluded from the comparable company owned store base  the increase in comparable company owned store net sales would have been for fiscal versus as reported 
the company does not consider the effect to be material to the overall comparable store sales results and believes the inclusion of expanded stores in the comparable store net sales to be an acceptable practice  consistent with the practice followed by the company in prior periods and by some other retailers 
wh bm stores acquired in the white house  inc acquisition were included in the comparable store sales calculation for the first time beginning in october and wh bm stores opened since the acquisition are treated the same as all other company owned stores 
soma stores began entering into the comparable store sales calculation in september and due to the small number of stores have not had a material impact on the comparable store sales calculation 
sales from fitigues stores were included in new store sales in fiscal and will be included in discontinued operations in fiscal due to the planned closure of the brand 
the company believes that the overall increase in comparable company store net sales an increase for the wh bm brand  offset by a relatively flat change for the chico s brand for fiscal was impacted by missteps in fashion merchandising  an aggressive store opening relocation expansion program that the company believes contributed to less than acceptable store service levels and a refocusing of the direction of the company s marketing initiatives 

table of contents the following table sets forth for each of the quarters of the previous five fiscal years  the percentage change in comparable store net sales at company owned stores from the comparable period in the prior fiscal year fiscal year ended full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter liquidity and capital resources overview the company s ongoing capital requirements have been and are for funding capital expenditures for new  expanded  relocated and remodeled stores and increased merchandise inventories  for planned expansion of its headquarters  distribution center and other central support facilities  to fund stock repurchases under the company s previous stock repurchase programs  and for continued improvement in information technology tools  including the ongoing conversion the company is planning to the sap software platform 
the following table shows the company s capital resources at the end of fiscal year and amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal cash and cash equivalents marketable securities working capital working capital decreased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the company s share repurchase programs during fiscal which totaled million 
this decrease in working capital was partially offset by the company s cash generated from operating activities  which cash was more than necessary to satisfy the company s investment in capital expenditures 
the significant components of the company s working capital are cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and inventories reduced by accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
based on past performance and current expectations  the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will satisfy the company s working capital needs  capital expenditure needs see new store openings and headquarters expansion discussed below  commitments  and other liquidity requirements associated with the company s operations through at least the next months 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the cash provided by operating activities for both periods was due to the company s net income  adjusted for non cash charges and changes in working capital such as depreciation and amortization expense  deferred tax benefits  stock based compensation expense and the related income tax effects thereof  normal fluctuations in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid and other current assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

table of contents in addition  prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company presented all tax benefits related to tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires that cash flows resulting from tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for those options excess tax benefits be classified as financing cash flows 
as a result  the company classified million of excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow and a corresponding operating cash outflow for fiscal the million of tax benefit of stock options exercised in fiscal is presented as an operating cash inflow in the prior period in accordance with apb investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company s investment in capital expenditures during fiscal primarily related to the planning and opening of new  relocated  remodeled and expanded chico s  wh bm  soma and fitigues stores million  costs associated with system upgrades and new software implementations million  costs and improvements associated with the purchase of a acre property adjacent to the company s current headquarters campus million  distribution center infrastructure costs million  and other miscellaneous capital expenditures million 
capital expenditures increased by million from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of increased costs related to the opening of a greater number of new  relocated  remodeled and expanded chico s  wh bm  soma and fitigues stores and increased information system technology investments related to new technology initiatives  including the company s decision to move to the sap software platform 
the company sold million  net  of marketable securities in the current year primarily to fund the company s stock repurchase programs 
by contrast  in the prior period  the company invested million  net  in marketable securities 
in addition  during fiscal  the company completed the purchase of most of the assets of the fitigues brand stores for million and paid million for the purchase of the net assets of one of its franchise stores  while in fiscal  the company purchased an equity investment in a privately held company for business and strategic purposes totaling million 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal while net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal in march  the company s board of directors the board approved the repurchase  over a twelve month period ending in march  of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock in connection with this stock repurchase program  which represented the entire million initial stock repurchase program authorized by the company s board 
in may  the company announced that its board had approved the repurchase of an additional million of the company s common stock over a twelve month period ending in may during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock in connection with this stock repurchase program  which represented the entire additional million program authorized by the company s board 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company repurchased an additional  shares of restricted stock in connection with employee tax withholding obligations under employee compensation plans  which are not purchases under any publicly announced plan 
as discussed above  prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company presented all tax benefits related to tax deductions attributable to the exercise of stock options as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires that cash flows resulting from tax benefits related to such tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for those options excess tax benefits be classified as financing cash flows 
as a result  the company classified million of excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow in fiscal with no comparable amount in fiscal

new store openings and headquarters expansion during fiscal  the company plans to open approximately net new stores excluding the planned fitigues closures and the acquired franchise stores  of which are expected to be chico s stores  are expected to be wh bm stores and are expected to be soma stores 
the company believes that the liquidity needed for its planned new store growth including continued investments associated with the decision to grow its new concept  soma  continuing remodel expansion program  continued installation and upgrading of new and existing software packages  and maintenance of proper inventory levels associated with this growth will be funded from cash flow from operations and its existing strong cash and marketable securities balances 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company completed the purchase of approximately acres of property adjacent to the company s current headquarters site on metro parkway in fort myers  florida to serve as the base for expansion of the company s corporate headquarters operations 
the property includes seven existing buildings aggregating approximately  square feet of space  most of which continues to be leased to unrelated third parties 
as leases expire  the company anticipates it will be utilizing the vacant space  which is likely to require modifications  for its expanding corporate headquarters needs 
the total cost for this property  along with the buildings  was approximately million  which includes all transaction costs as of february  the acquisition was funded from the company s existing cash and marketable securities balances 
with respect to addressing the needs for additional distribution center space  the company is evaluating its requirements and the appropriate timing to make additional distribution center capacity available 
the company s present goal in this regard is to begin design work in fiscal it is currently anticipated that the company will require additional distribution space in late fiscal or early fiscal and  initially  the company is focusing its evaluation on the expansion of its current distribution center on existing adjacent land that is already owned by the company 
during fiscal  the company completed the purchase of acres in south fort myers  florida originally intended for the location of a new corporate headquarters campus for a total cost of million  which included all transaction costs and million of road impact fees 
when the acre property adjacent to its current headquarters site became available  the company decided to plan its expansion at its current location and to hold the acre property for investment 
during the third quarter of fiscal  management committed to a plan to sell the acre property and the company anticipates that the land will be sold within the next months 
the company does not expect that any such sale will have any material impact on its statements of operations or overall financial position 
in may  the company announced that it will work with sap  a third party vendor  to implement an enterprise resource planning system erp to assist in managing its retail stores  beginning first with its soma brand 
this fully integrated system is expected to support and coordinate all aspects of product development  merchandising  finance and accounting and to be fully scalable to accommodate rapid growth 
on february   the company successfully completed the first major phase of its multi year  planned implementation of the new erp system by converting its soma brand to the new merchandising system and rolling out the new financial systems at the same time 
the second major phase anticipates an initial roll out and utilization of this new system in each of its other brands beginning as early as the end of fiscal or the first half of fiscal the third major phase contemplates on going enhancements and optimization of the new erp across all three brands  as well as the deployment of additional functionality across various other functions within the company through fiscal the company expects that the costs associated with the implementation of the erp system will be funded from the company s existing cash and marketable securities balances 

table of contents the company further believes that this liquidity will be sufficient  based on the above  to fund anticipated capital needs over the near term  including the recent franchisee acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal given the company s existing cash and marketable securities balances and the capacity included in its bank credit facilities  the company does not believe that it would need to seek other sources of financing to conduct its operations or pursue its expansion plans even if cash flow from operations should prove to be less than anticipated or if there should arise a need for additional letter of credit capacity due to establishing new and expanded sources of supply  or if the company were to increase the number of new stores planned to be opened  expanded or relocated in future periods 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at february  amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt short term borrowings capital lease obligations operating leases non cancelable purchase commitments total as of february   the company s contractual obligations consisted of amounts outstanding under operating leases and non cancelable purchase commitments 
amounts due under non cancelable purchase commitments consists of amounts to be paid under agreements to purchase inventory that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms  as well as amounts due on commercial letters of credit outstanding 
in june  the company entered into the second restated revolving credit loan agreement with bank of america  na the agreement  which replaced the restated revolving credit and term loan agreement dated as of september  on terms and conditions substantially similar to the replaced facility 
the terms of the agreement provide for a million aggregate revolving credit loan commitment  with a letter of credit sublimit of million and a line of credit sublimit of million 
the revolving credit facility initially matured june   but automatically renewed through june  and is set up to continue to automatically renew for additional one year periods through at february  and january   the company did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  of the type  which certain other companies have established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer product returns  inventories  income taxes  insurance reserves  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company identifies potentially excess and slow moving inventories by evaluating turn rates and inventory levels in conjunction with the company s overall growth rate 
excess quantities are identified through evaluation of inventory ageings  review of inventory turns and historical sales experiences  as well as specific identification based on fashion trends 
further  exposure to inadequate realization of carrying value is identified through analysis of gross margins and markdowns in combination with changes in the fashion industry 
the company provides lower of cost or market reserves for such identified excess and slow moving inventories 
inventory shrinkage the company estimates its expected shrinkage of inventories between physical inventory counts by applying historical chain wide average shrinkage experience rates to the related periods sales volume 
the historical rates are updated on a regular basis to reflect the most recent physical inventory shrinkage experience 
revenue recognition although the company s recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment  revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy of the company 
retail sales by company stores are recorded at the point of sale and are net of estimated customer returns  sales discounts under the passport club and the black book loyalty programs and company issued coupons 
retail sales by catalog and internet are recorded when shipments are made to catalog and internet customers and are net of estimated customer returns 
net sales to franchisees are recorded when merchandise is shipped to franchisees and are net of estimated returns 
under the company s current program  gift certificate and gift card sales do not have expiration dates 
the company accounts for gift certificates and gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift certificate or gift card is sold 
the liability is relieved and revenue is recognized for gift certificates and gift cards upon redemption 
in addition  the company recognizes revenue on unredeemed gift certificates and gift cards when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift certificate or gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift certificates or gift cards to relevant jurisdictions commonly referred to as gift card breakage 
the company recognizes gift card breakage under the redemptive recognition method 
this method records gift card breakage as revenue on a proportional basis over the redemption period based on the company s historical gift card breakage rate 
the company determines the gift card breakage rate based on its historical redemption patterns 
once the breakage rate is determined  it is recognized over a month period based on historical redemption patterns of gift certificates and gift cards 
the company s policy is to honor customer returns in most instances 
returns after days of the original purchase  or returns without the original receipt  qualify for store credit only 
the company will  in certain circumstances  offer full customer refunds either after days or without a receipt 
the company estimates its reserve for likely customer returns based on the average refund experience in relation to sales for the related period 
evaluation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed periodically for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount  an asset is determined to be impaired  and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of the company s reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 

table of contents if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
the company evaluates its other intangible assets  specifically trademarks  for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  medical and general liability claims 
self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using historical experience 
although management believes it has the ability to adequately accrue for estimated losses related to claims  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from recorded self insurance liabilities 
income taxes the company records reserves for estimates of probable settlements of tax audits 
at any point in time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings and changes in the expected outcome of tax audits 
accounting for contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to various proceedings  lawsuits  disputes and claims actions arising from its normal business activities 
many of these actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties 
accounting for contingencies arising from these actions requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual  if any  related to such contingencies 
management may also consult with outside legal counsel to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of such actions could be different than management s estimate  and adjustments may be required 
stock based compensation expense effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized during fiscal for share based awards includes a compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for the prior period have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company recognized stock based compensation expense in accordance with apb and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas the calculation of share based employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgments 
these estimates include the fair value of each of the stock option awards granted  which is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
there are two significant inputs into the black scholes option pricing model expected volatility and expected term 
the company estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the company s stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  stock based compensation 
table of contents expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest  penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure related to uncertain income tax positions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf ratified issue no 
eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
taxes within the scope of eitf issue no 
include any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include  but are not limited to  sales taxes  use taxes  value added taxes  and some excise taxes 
the eitf concluded that the presentation of these taxes on either a gross included in revenues and costs or a net excluded from revenues basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements

eitf is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  as the company does not intend to modify its current accounting policy of recording sales tax collected on a net basis  the adoption of eitf will have no material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and inflation although the operations of the company are influenced by general economic conditions  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the current or prior periods 
the company does not consider its business to be seasonal 
the company reports its sales on a monthly basis in line with other public companies in the women s apparel industry 
although the company believes this regular reporting of interim sales may provide for greater transparency to investors  the company is concerned that these interim results tend to be relied upon too heavily as a trend 
for example  such factors as the weather numerous hurricanes in fiscal and  national events elections  international events and developments in iraq  interest rates  increased oil and other energy costs  changes in the nature of its merchandise promotions  and similar factors can significantly affect the company for a particular period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk of the company s financial instruments as of february  has not significantly changed since january  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on any future indebtedness and its marketable securities 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates in part to its revolving line of credit with its bank  however  as of february   the company did not have any outstanding borrowings on its line of credit and  given its strong liquidity position  does not expect to utilize its line of credit in the foreseeable future except for its continuing use of the letter of credit facility portion thereof 
the company s investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company s investment policy which identifies allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
the company s investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents and marketable securities  including variable rate demand notes and auction rate securities  which are highly liquid variable rate municipal debt securities 
although these securities have long term nominal maturity dates ranging from to  the interest rates are reset  depending on the type of security  either daily  every days or every days 
despite the long term nature of the underlying securities  the company has the ability to quickly liquidate these securities based on the company s cash needs thereby creating a short term instrument 
accordingly  the company s investments are classified as available for sale securities 
as of february   an increase or decrease of basis points in interest rates would have had no impact on the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio
