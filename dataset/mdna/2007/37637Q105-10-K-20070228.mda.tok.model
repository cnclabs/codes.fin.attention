item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to december  the following discussion is intended to provide a more comprehensive review of the company s operating results and financial condition than can be obtained from reading the consolidated financial statements alone 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included later in this report 
all numbers  except per share data  are expressed in thousands of dollars 
highlights and overview during the past year  the company acquired six banks that accounted for an increase in total assets of million  net loans of million  and deposits of million 
the five subsidiaries acquired as result of the acquisition of cdc are one reporting segment for purposes of financial reporting for the year ended december  these subsidiaries include citizens state bank  first citizens bank of billings  first national bank of lewistown  western bank of chinook  and first citizens bank  na on january   citizens state bank  first citizens bank of billings  and first citizens bank  na were merged into first security  western  and glacier  respectively  without name change for first security  western  and glacier 
it is anticipated that during june of  western bank of chinook will merge into first national bank of lewistown 
the acquisition of morgan expanded the company s presence in the rapidly expanding northern utah market  complementing the park city and brigham city offices of mountain west bank 
the acquisitions resulted in additional goodwill of million and core deposit intangibles of million at december  in connection with the cdc acquisition  the company completed its first secondary offering of common stock since becoming a publicly traded company in an additional million shares of common stock were issued on august  raising approximately million in cash 
the company experienced strong loan growth with total loans outstanding increasing by million  or percent from the prior year 
without the acquisitions  loans increased million  or percent 
all loan classifications experienced increases with commercial loan growth leading the way with an increase of million  or percent 
real estate loans increased million  or percent  and consumer loans increased by million  or percent 
due to the continuing reduction in spreads on funding costs versus investment yields  the cash flow from investments were used to fund loans 
investments  including interest bearing deposits and fed funds sold  declined million  or percent  from the prior year 
non interest bearing deposits increased million or percent during the year providing a stable low cost funding source for a portion of the asset growth 
the company also increased interest bearing deposits by million or percent 
acquisitions contributed million and million of the non interest bearing and interest bearing deposit growth  respectively 
the increase in deposits  and an increase of million in repurchase agreements with certain customers  has allowed the company to reduce its funding with the federal home loan bank by million  which typically has a higher interest rate than other sources 
increases in short term interest rates by the federal reserve bank during and have resulted in higher yields on loans and sources of funding 
the increase in loan volumes  higher loan rates  and the increase in non interest bearing deposits  resulted in an increase in net interest income of million  or percent  over the prior year 
higher funding costs  due to increased short term interest rates  offset some of the increased interest income 
the company also increased non interest income by million  primarily the result of volume increases in the loan and deposit portfolios and related fees 
mortgage loans originated during exceeded billion  an all time production record for the company 
non interest expense increased million  or percent  from last year with the largest increase occurring in compensation and benefits 
acquisitions  additional branch locations and related staffing  merit increases  and the million impact of sfas revised  share based payment  which requires the recording of the estimated fair value of stock options as compensation expense over the requisite servicing period  were the primary reasons for the increase 
other operating expenses also increased  reflecting the increased volume of activities in loan and deposit operations and the acquired bank activity 
looking forward  our future performance will depend on many factors including economic conditions  interest rate changes  increasing competition for deposits and quality loans  and regulatory burden 
increasing interest rates will slow the volume of real estate loan originations which reduces the fee income from that activity  while at the same time reducing commission expense for loan originators 
increasing rates result in increased earnings on assets  however  the cost of interest bearing funds also increases 
the company s goal of its asset and liability management practices is to maintain or increase the level of net interest income within an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
financial condition assets the results of operations and financial condition include the acquisitions from the completion dates forward

virtually all assets of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a company s performance than does the effect of inflation 
commitments in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit  such as letter of credits and un advanced loan commitments  and lease obligation commitments  which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions 
the company has outstanding debt maturities  the largest of which are the advances from the federal home loan bank

represents interest and non interest bearing checking  money market  and savings accounts market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk the objective of interest rate risk management is to contain the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the process involves identification and management of the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
managing interest rate risk is not an exact science 
the interval between repricing of interest rates of assets and liabilities changes from day to day as the assets and liabilities change 
for some assets and liabilities  contractual maturity and the actual cash flows experienced are not the same 
a good example is residential mortgages that have long term contractual maturities but may be repaid well in advance of the maturity when current prevailing interest rates become lower than the contractual rate 
interest bearing deposits without a stated maturity could be withdrawn after seven days 
however  the bank s experience indicates that these funding pools have a much longer duration and are not as sensitive to interest rate changes as other financial instruments 
prime based loans generally have rate changes when the federal reserve bank changes short term interest rates 
however  depending on the magnitude of the rate change and the relationship of the current rates to rate floors and rate ceilings that may be in place on the loans  the loan rate may not change 
gap analysis the following table gives a description of our gap position for various time periods 
as of december   we had a negative gap position at six months and a negative gap position at twelve months 
the cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets for six months is a negative percent which compares to a negative percent at december  and a negative percent at december  the table also shows the gap earnings sensitivity  and earnings sensitivity ratio  along with a brief description as to how they are calculated 
the methodology used to compile this gap information is based on our mix of assets and liabilities and the historical experience accumulated regarding their rate sensitivity

this table estimates the repricing maturities of the company s assets and liabilities  based upon the company s assessment of the repricing characteristics of the various instruments 
interest bearing checking and regular savings are included in the more than years category 
money market balances are included in the less than months category 
mortgage backed securities are at the anticipated principal payments based on the weighted average life 
net interest income simulation the traditional one dimensional view of gap is not sufficient to show a bank s ability to withstand interest rate changes 
because of limitations in gap modeling the asset liability management committee alco of the company uses a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s statement of financial condition 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward and or bp downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed as a benchmark 
other non parallel rate movement scenarios are also modeled to determine the potential impact on net interest income 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  and as compared to the percent policy limit approved by the company s and banks board of directors

the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility that the company will not be able to fund present and future obligations 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain cash flows adequate to meet current and future needs for credit demand  deposit withdrawals  maturing liabilities and corporate operating expenses 
core deposits  fhlb credit lines  available for sale investment securities  and net income are the key elements in meeting these objectives 
all subsidiaries banks  except western bank of chinook  na  are members of the fhlb of seattle 
this membership provides for established lines of credit in the form of advances that are a supplemental source of funds for lending and other general business purposes 
as of december   the company had million of borrowing capacity with the fhlb of seattle of which million was utilized 
accordingly  management of the company has a wide range of versatility in managing the liquidity and asset liability mix for each individual institution as well as the company as a whole 
capital resources and adequacy maintaining capital strength has been a long term objective 
ample capital is necessary to sustain growth  provide protection against unanticipated declines in asset values  and to safeguard the funds of depositors 
capital also is a source of funds for loan demand and enables the company to effectively manage its assets and liabilities 
shareholders equity increased million during  or percent the net result of earnings of million  common stock issued for the acquisition of citizens development corporation and first national bank of morgan  public offering of stock  less cash dividend payments and an increase of million in the net unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities

per share  or percent in the payment of dividends is subject to government regulation in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
critical accounting policies companies may apply certain critical accounting policies requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company considers its only material critical accounting policy to be the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balance of allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at the amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the appropriate balance of allowance for loan and lease losses is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  industry concentrations and the impact of current local  regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
for additional information regarding the allowance for loan and lease losses  its relation to the provision for loan losses and risk related to asset quality  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  expressing the staff s view regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab requires that when quantifying misstatements for the purposes of evaluating materiality  the effects on both the income statement and balance sheet should be considered 
the company has evaluated the requirements of sab  and it did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no

the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard  but does not expect it to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb emerging issue task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements 
the eitf determined that for an endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangement within the scope of the issue  the employer should recognize a liability for future benefits in accordance with sfas no

this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company expects to adopt the interpretation during the first quarter of without material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for servicing of financial assets 
sfas no 
requires that all separately recognized servicing rights be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
sfas no 
permits an entity to choose either of the following subsequent measurement methods the amortization of servicing assets or liabilities in proportion to and over the net servicing income period or net servicing loss periods or the reporting of servicing assets or liabilities at fair value at each reporting date and reporting changes in fair value in earnings in the periods in which the change occur 
sfas no 
is effective the earlier of the date an entity adopts the requirements of sfas no 
 or as of the beginning of its first fiscal year beginning after september  the company will adopt the statement beginning january  and will choose the amortization of servicing assets over the net servicing income or loss period which is its current practice  therefore  there will be minimal impact to the company 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no
