item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary during  our financial condition continued to strengthen and our results from operations improved compared to the previous year 
this is attributed to several factors  including new product introductions  the successful penetration of new customers  and overall industry growth fueled largely by increasing adoption of the apco project standard and customer migration to compliant digital products 
new products and product enhancements that were introduced in include the go box portable repeater  a high power mobile radio and a new digital apco project compliant portable radio  the dph cmd  for field command and coordination functions 
product enhancements include an is certified design for our apco project digital portable radios  which enables their deployment in hazardous environments where flammable gas  liquid or combustible dust may be present  including oil refineries  mines  chemical plants and flour mills 
to be deemed intrinsically safe  products must pass a rigorous series of tests  which certify they will not emit electrical sparks during normal operation 
also  in january  our digital encryption module was validated by the national institute of standards and technology nist as fips compliant 
we believe nist s validation of the encryption module will enhance our initiatives to address a broader and growing a rray of market opportunities for p digital radios  particularly in homeland security and the military 
sales for increased by approximately million to million from million for our growth in sales was driven primarily by digital apco project compliant products sold to the government and public safety sector of the market  reflecting the industry wide increase in demand for such products  combined with our introduction of new products and penetration of new customers 
sales of our apco project digital products increased approximately from government and public safety two way radio users  we believe  will continue migrating to products with apco project digital technology 
we plan to introduce additional new digital products in and gross margins as a percent of sales in improved to from in our margins have continued to improve as higher margin digital products have comprised a greater portion of total sales for compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased as we continued to invest in new product development and sales and marketing initiatives 
the additional spending in these areas is intended to drive sales growth by expediting the introduction of new products  including additional apco project digital products  while expanding and intensifying our sales activities

income tax expense for totaled million compared to an income tax benefit of million for  a comparative expense increase of million 
the tax expense for is almost entirely non cash  primarily the result of utilizing our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
due to the impact of the aforementioned non cash expenses related to stock based compensation and income taxes  net income was approximately million  or per basic and per fully diluted share  compared to net income of approximately million  or per basic and per fully diluted share 
the strength and liquidity of our balance sheet as of december  improved significantly as cash and cash equivalents increased million to approximately million from million as of december  meanwhile  our current liabilities as of december  decreased million to approximately million from approximately million as of december  additionally  we continue to be free of long term debt

our growth in sales was driven primarily by digital apco project compliant products sold to the government and public safety segment of the market  reflecting the industry wide increase in demand for such products  combined with our introduction of new products and penetration of new customers 
sales of our apco project digital products in increased approximately from during the past year  we broadened our digital product offerings  introducing additional p products such as our dph cmd portable radio  our go box portable repeater and our digital mobile radio  as well as new digital capabilities such as encryption 
these developments enable us to expand our addressable market and add new customers  including agencies of homeland security and the military 
government and public safety two way radio users  we believe  will continue migrating to products with apco project digital technology  which should serve as a catalyst for future growth in digital sales and total sales 
we also have plans to further expand our addressable market through the introduction of additional p products and capabilities in and sales of conventional analog products in decreased approximately from the previous year 
although gains were realized in certain commercial and industrial market segments  demand for analog products in the government and public safety market declined during the year as more users migrated to newer product designs incorporating p digital technology 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for decreased to from for for  the cost of products included non cash stock based compensation expense totaling approximately  of sales 
we did not recognize non cash stock based compensation expense in contract manufacturing relationships have helped improve our production efficiencies and reduce material and labor costs 
they have also enabled us to effectively control internal manufacturing support expenses 
furthermore  we have been able to leverage increased sales volumes to improve our utilization of manufacturing related assets 
we believe further efficiencies and cost reductions can be realized from volume increases in the future 
the mix of products in our total sales also impacts the cost of products and gross margins 
for  sales of higher specification products that incorporate recent  more cost effective product designs  particularly p digital products  comprised a greater portion of our sales  yielding higher average selling prices and improved gross margins compared to the prior year 
we continuously evaluate manufacturing alternatives to improve quality and reduce our product costs 
we anticipate that the current contract manufacturing relationships or comparable alternatives will be available to us in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of marketing  sales  commissions  engineering  development  management information systems  accounting  headquarters  and non cash stock based compensation expenses 
for the year ended december   sg a expenses totaled approximately million of sales compared to approximately million of sales for for  sg a expenses included non cash stock based compensation expense totaling approximately  of sales 
we did not recognize non cash stock based compensation expense for the prior year 
the overall increase in sg a expenses is attributed primarily to increases in product development and selling and marketing initiatives combined with non cash stock based compensation expense 
engineering and product development expenses in increased by approximately  compared to last year 
these increases were primarily due to additional staff and development expenses  as well as non cash stock based compensation expense 
the additional investment in engineering and product development is intended to enhance our ability to complete and introduce new products  including additional p digital products 
bringing such products to market and achieving a significant share of the market will continue to require investment 
internal development efforts are focused on our digital product program 
this program is planned to yield additional products in and we believe such products will be a primary source of sales growth in the future 
marketing and selling expenses increased by approximately million for compared to last year 
this increase was the result of several factors 
commission expense increased directly as a result of increased sales revenues 
also  a greater portion of sales were derived from commissionable sources 
during  we added new sales staff  and incurred expenses designed to raise and enhance our profile  facilitating our ability to penetrate new customers and drive sales growth  particularly from government and public safety opportunities for p digital products 
additionally  we recognized non cash stock based compensation expense during the year 
general and administrative expenses for increased by approximately  compared to last year 
this increase was almost entirely driven by non cash stock based compensation expense  which was not recognized in the prior year 
operating income operating income for increased approximately  compared to last year 
non cash stock based compensation totaling  impacted operating income significantly 
this expense was not recognized in the prior year 
excluding that impact  operating income increased approximately million 
the improvement is attributable to sales growth and mix as well as new products and operating improvements that reduced product costs 
interest income  net for  we earned approximately  in net interest income compared to  for the prior year 
we earn interest income on our cash balances and incur interest expense on borrowings from our revolving line of credit

these nols total million for federal and state purposes  with expirations starting in and ending in in order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset  we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years prior to the expiration of our nols 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement requires us to analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if  based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset 
the recognition of the net deferred tax asset and related tax benefit is based upon our conclusions regarding  among other considerations  our estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  our current and anticipated customers  contracts and product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
we have evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our net deferred tax asset 
from our evaluation we have concluded that based on the weight of available evidence we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets recorded at december  accordingly  no valuation allowance was recognized as of december  we cannot presently estimate what  if any  changes to the valuation of our deferred tax asset may be deemed appropriate in the future 
if we incur future losses  it may be necessary to reduce some or the entire deferred tax asset recognized as of december  fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales net sales for the year ended december  increased approximately million to approximately million from million for in  we realized sales growth in both the government and public safety  and the business and industrial markets of our business 
this growth was from new customers and contracts  as well as increasing demand from recurring customers and existing contracts  and was fueled primarily by the introduction of new products  both analog and digital 
we also benefited from the increasing momentum of our apco project products 
we brought twelve new radio products to market in sales from new products for both of our markets government and public safety  and business and industrial increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
this includes sales of our bk radio brand analog and digital products sold principally to agencies of federal  state and local governments  as well as sales of relm and relm bk brand products sold primarily to business and industrial concerns 
these p roducts were introduced at various times during and sales of other conventional analog products increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year  reflecting strengthening overall demand for lmr products and our improved competitive position 
to capitalize on the advantages of our new products and the accelerating migration to apco project digital products  we expanded our sales and marketing initiatives in we expect to continue this focus in cost of sales and gross margins cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  decreased to from for gross margins showed improvement as we were able to leverage increasing volumes to successfully reduce manufacturing and support costs as a percentage of sales while maintaining our high quality standard 
contract manufacturing relationships continue to favorably impact our production efficiencies  and material and labor costs 
they have also enabled us to effectively control internal manufacturing support expenses 
furthermore  the volume from increased sales during the year enabled us to more fully utilize and absorb our base of manufacturing support expenses 
additional sales growth and volume increases  we believe  may yield further improvements in cost of sales as a percentage of sales 
the mix of products in our total sales has also contributed to improved margins 
sales of higher specification products to government and public safety customers  including apco project digital products  and sales of new relm analog products increased for compared to also  overall  our product lines are comprised of a greater portion of new products incorporating recent  more cost effective designs 
we continuously evaluate manufacturing alternatives to improve quality and reduce our product costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the ordinary course of business for borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which bear interest at a variable rate 
the lender presently charges interest at prime rate plus 
as of december   we had no debt outstanding under this facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected for disclosure our revenue recognition process and our more subjective accounting estimation processes 
these processes affect our reported revenues and current assets and are therefore critical in assessing the financial and operating status of relm 
the processes for determining the allowance for collection of trade receivables and the reserves for excess or obsolete inventory involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on relm s operations and financial position 
revenue sales revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection is reasonably assured 
the earnings process is generally complete when the product is shipped or received by the customer  depending upon whether the title to the goods  as well as the risks and benefits of ownership are transferred to the customer at point of shipment or point of delivery 
however  sales to the united states government are recognized when the products are delivered 
we periodically review our revenue recognition procedures to assure that such procedures are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and staff accounting bulletin no 
allowance for collection losses the allowance for collection losses was approximately  on gross trade receivables of approximately million as of december  this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables as of december  because the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding as of december  cannot be known with certainty as of this report s date  we rely on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have typically been infrequent with write offs of trade receivables 
for the last four years our average write offs has been less than  annually 
we maintain a general allowance up to approximately of the gross trade receivables balance in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but turn out to have such an inabilit y 
currently  our allowance on trade receivables is approximately of gross receivables 
as revenues and total receivables increase  the allowance balance may also increase 
we also maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify those accounts that are more likely than not to have collection problems 
we may reserve a portion or all of the customer s balance 
we had no specific allowance as of december  inventory reserve the reserve for slow moving  excess  or obsolete inventory was approximately million at december  as compared to approximately million at december  the reserve for slow moving  excess  or obsolete inventory is used to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
because the amount of inventory that we will actually recoup through sales cannot be known with certainty at any particular time  we rely on past sales experience  future sales forecasts  and our strategic business plans 
generally  in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify inventory as having been used or unused during the past year 
for raw material inventory with no usage in the past year  we reserve of its cost  which takes into account a scrap value  while for finished goods inventory with no usage in the past year we reserve of its cost 
for inventory with usage in the past year  in order to get the most pertinent usage prof ile  we review the annual sales and usage over the most recent three years  project that amount over a five year horizon  and reserve of the excess amount which excess amount equals inventory on hand less the five year projected usage amount 
we believe that represents the value of excess inventory we would not be able to recover due to new product introductions and other technological advancements over the next five years 
we review our actual recovery experience on the sale of excess or obsolete inventory in order to assure that the reserve and recovery percentages utilized in the analysis are reasonable 
supplemental to the aforementioned analysis  specific inventory items are reviewed individually by management 
based on the review  considering business levels  future prospects  new products and technology changes  the valuation of specific inventory items may be adjusted to reflect a more accurate valuation  in the business judgment of management 
management also performs a determination of net realizable value for all finished goods with a selling price below cost 
for all such items  the inventory is valued at not more than the selling price 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized 
the effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income in the period in which the change is recognized 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that impairment of tax assets are more likely than not 
in determining whether a tax asset is realizable  we consider among other things  est imates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and new product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
if we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future
