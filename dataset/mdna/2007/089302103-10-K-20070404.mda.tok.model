item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein 
please refer to item a of this form k for a discussion of forward looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
we follow the concept of a week fiscal year  which ends on the saturday nearest to january fiscal year was comprised of weeks 
fiscal years and were each comprised of weeks 
business developments operating initiatives and results the following is an overview of significant operating initiatives that have been executed or are in progress that we believe led or contributed to improved operating performance in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
actions taken in fiscal year evaluation of individual store performance and the closure of stores including all of our stand alone furniture stores 
the majority of these closed stores were underperforming 
execution of a series of markdowns lowering in store inventory levels in certain categories and improving turnover 
realignment of our field operations and elimination of some redundancies between closeout and furniture store operations 
reduction of personnel at our stores  distribution centers  and general office 
exit from the frozen food business 
actions taken in fiscal year opened fewer stores compared to prior years primarily as a result of rising real estate costs for prospective new sites and our focused efforts on improving operating results of existing stores 
tested and executed newly developed merchandising plans focusing on obtaining higher gross margin dollars and improved inventory turnover 
tested and evaluated marketing approach including in store signage  mix and amount of television advertising  and advertising circular print and distribution methods 
continued to focus on improving efficiencies in our purchasing and distribution practices intending to increase store productivity 
initiated a pilot project to test a new point of sale register system that will replace our existing point of sale hardware and software  with installation in all stores during fiscal years and we believe these initiatives and activities have contributed to our operating performance for fiscal year when compared to the operating performance of fiscal year comparable store sales increased 
sales per selling square foot improved by 
gross margin dollars improved million with fewer stores included in continuing operations 
inventory turnover rate improved to times versus times in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales improved basis points to of sales versus of sales in fiscal year depreciation expense as a percent of sales decreased basis points to of sales versus of sales in fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved to per share compared to per share in fiscal year cash provided by operating activities was million and we ended fiscal year with million of cash and cash equivalents 
acquired million of our common shares for a total cost of million under the repurchase program announced in february see the discussion and analysis below for additional details of our operating results 
litigation in the third quarter of fiscal year  we reached tentative settlements of two employment related civil class actions brought against us 
the tentative settlements are subject to court approval and acceptance by the class 
we recorded  in the third quarter of fiscal year  a pretax charge of million included in selling and administrative expenses for the estimated settlement liability for these matters 
we believe that the liability for these matters was adequately reserved at february  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional detail on these matters 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded pretax income of million in selling and administrative expenses upon receipt of our portion of the visa mastercard antitrust litigation settlement funds that compensate merchants for the excessive fees they paid for certain visa and mastercard transactions 
what s important now win strategy in  we initiated a strategic assessment of our operations 
specifically  we focused on opportunities for improved financial performance as a result of a detailed analysis of our real estate  operating expenses  and merchandising 
this strategic assessment resulted in specific initiatives collectively referred to by us as our win strategy 
real estate as a result of the real estate analysis conducted as part of the win strategy  we closed stores during fiscal year  a significant portion of which were underperforming 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the operating results of of these closed stores were reclassified to discontinued operations in fiscal year and all prior periods reported 
the table below identifies the significant components of loss from discontinued operations related to the closed stores for fiscal years   and  respectively 
fiscal year in thousands net sales   gross margin   operating loss    loss from discontinued operations  net of tax   our results related to discontinued operations in fiscal year primarily represent exit related costs and ongoing costs associated with leased properties yet to be terminated or subleased 
our results of discontinued operations in fiscal year include pretax losses in the amount of million  including million of exit related pretax costs 
the table below summarizes the type and amount of charges recorded as a result of the store closures and identifies remaining exit liabilities as of february  write down of property  severance lease inventory  and and termination deferred rent benefits costs total in thousands charges     payments    non cash reductions   remaining obligations at january     settlement savings   accretion expense payments    remaining obligations at february  write downs of property and inventory include assets used in normal operations of retail stores and remaining unrecoverable net book values of fixtures  equipment  and signs 
the inventory write downs above were specific to the markdowns associated with liquidation sales conducted at the closed stores  which qualified for discontinued operations accounting treatment 
we record markdowns throughout the year in the normal course of business 
the markdowns associated with the liquidation sales were the only markdowns included in the table above 
future cash outlays related to the above lease termination costs are anticipated to be million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million thereafter 
operating expenses our review of our operating expenses resulted in personnel reductions in our general office  field operations  and distribution centers in fiscal year certain resources were realigned based on the fiscal year store closings and lower expected store growth in the near term 
additionally  some redundancies between the closeout store operations and the furniture store operations were eliminated 
merchandising in fiscal year  as part of a review of our merchandising strategy  we closed our stand alone furniture stores  executed a series of markdowns lowering in store inventory levels in certain categories and improving inventory turnover  and exited the frozen food business 
we developed our merchandise strategy with the goals of growing sales per square foot and increasing gross margin dollars 
we performed customer research and found that brand names  treasure hunt  price  value  and savings were most important to our customers 
certain elements of the merchandising strategy were tested and executed in fiscal year in fiscal year  we refined the detailed merchandising plans in order for each merchant to understand his or her targeted levels of closeout merchandise  engineered closeout merchandise items that we often develop along with our vendors  and consistency type products that our customers expect us to have 
our preference is to maximize the amount of closeout merchandise which we believe provides great value to the customer 
we have communicated many of these expectations to our vendors so that they understand our expectations and can collaborate with us to get the desired types and quantities of merchandise to our stores 
one of the key elements to the success of the fiscal year merchandising strategy was the raise the ring strategy 
the raise the ring strategy involves offering a merchandise mix to the customer that includes items with slightly higher average item retail sales price 
one method used to accomplish this was to offer larger package or quantity sizes 
for example  instead of offering an item for sale on a per piece basis  we may offer the same product in a package of three or six pieces 
another part of the raise the ring strategy involved offering types of merchandise that helped increase average item retail  based on our belief that as long as the value proposition is compelling  our customers are willing to purchase higher ticket merchandise from us 
improved merchandising led to efficiencies in the cost side of the business as well 
inventory quantities were managed to lower levels helping to drive productivity in the distribution centers and stores 
our merchants worked with vendors to acquire items that were pre ticketed for sale and more efficiently and effectively allocated to and displayed in our stores 
markdowns were taken timely in order to keep merchandise in our stores fresh and to improve inventory turnover 
fewer cartons were processed by our distribution centers and stores while higher sales dollars were achieved 
our marketing efforts continued to involve a mix of circulars  in store marketing  and television advertising 
during fiscal year  we shifted circular and television advertising dollars to the november and december the nine weeks of christmas timeframe in order to commit more marketing expenditures during the period they could be expected to have the most impact 
many of the products offered in these circulars were a result of the merchandising strategies discussed above 
the planning and coordination that went into these circulars improved their effectiveness and resulted in higher sales  higher gross margin dollars  and improved inventory turnover rate 
because the majority of our customers consider themselves to be treasure hunters and come to our store without a specific item in mind to purchase  we developed better in store marketing strategies  such as improved signage  aimed at driving total sales dollars from each customer in the store 
this new signage was tested favorably during fiscal year and was rolled out to all stores late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year kb toys and pittsfield distribution center update for a discussion of these matters and other matters related to the kb toys business  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
results of operations the following table compares components of our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales fiscal year net sales cost of sales gross margin selling and administrative expenses depreciation expense operating profit interest expense interest and investment income income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss we have historically experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations  with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit being realized in the fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition  our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings  the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores  the timing of television and circular advertising  and the timing of certain holidays 
we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and incur higher shipping and payroll costs as a percent of sales in the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth fiscal quarter 
the following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit by fiscal quarter first second third fourth fiscal year net sales percentage of full year operating profit as a percentage of full year fiscal year net sales percentage of full year operating profit loss as a percentage of full year fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year this net sales increase of million is principally due to a increase in comparable store sales and sales made during the rd week in fiscal year our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of fiscal year this calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods 
from a merchandise perspective  the consumables  home  and other were the best performing categories 
within the consumables category  sales of food and health and beauty products drove the increase partially offset by the decline in sales of frozen food  which we discontinued in fiscal year within the home category  sales of furniture and domestics drove the increase 
within the other category  increases in sales of electronics and apparel were partially offset by lower sales of lingerie 
we internally evaluate and externally communicate overall sales and merchandise performances based on the following key merchandising categories  and we believe these categories facilitate analysis of our financial performance 
net sales by product category  net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales  and net sales change in dollars and percentage in fiscal year compared to fiscal year were as follows fiscal year change in thousands consumables    home    seasonal and toys    other    net sales    gross margin gross margin dollars increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year we achieved our stated goal to increase gross margin dollars as gross margin improved by million principally due to a combination of higher net sales and a slightly higher gross margin rate 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this gross margin rate increase of basis points was primarily due to an improvement in the initial mark up of merchandise purchased in fiscal year compared to purchases in fiscal year this improvement is primarily attributed to our merchandising strategies as previously discussed 
our inventory turnover improved to turns in fiscal year compared to turns in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year while net sales increased million  selling and administrative expenses increased only million and as a result  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the following items contributed to the basis point improvement in selling and administrative expense leverage the increase in comparable store sales  which was above our expense leverage point  our raise the ring merchandising strategy which delivered higher sales results with fewer cartons processed by the distribution centers and stores  reduction in general office and field operations headcount primarily due to the elimination of some redundancies between closeout and furniture store operations  and various initiatives aimed at improving efficiency at our stores and distribution centers including tightly managed payroll budgets  the initiation of a vendor compliance program  and merchandising strategies aimed at getting merchandise delivered that is more efficiently able to be displayed on the selling floor  for example  pre ticketed items and improved packaging pdq packaging  palletized end cap displays  etc some of the increases in selling and administrative expense components from fiscal year to fiscal year were bonus expense of million  wage litigation charges of million  utilities of million  stock based compensation expense of million  and asset impairment charges of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in store hourly wages of million  general office wages of million  field operations cost of million  and proceeds received as a result of the visa mastercard antitrust settlement of million 
the bonus expense increase is due primarily to our improved financial performance in fiscal year and compares to fiscal year where no general office bonus was paid 
the wage litigation charges are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
higher utilities are primarily a result of higher utility rates 
stock based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of adopting sfas no 
r see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the achievement of a performance based target with respect to restricted shares granted in the first quarter of fiscal year the asset impairment charges relate primarily to charges taken on certain underperforming stores that were opened in fiscal years and lower store hourly wages  even with the million increase in sales  are a result of improved productivity in the stores primarily due to lower inventory levels at the stores and our raise the ring merchandising strategy 
the decline in general office and field operations expenses are primarily a result of the reduction in headcount which included the elimination of some redundancies in the furniture and closeout operations 
outbound distribution and transportation costs  which were included in selling and administrative expenses see note to the consolidated financial statements decreased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year outbound distribution and transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the basis point decrease was primarily due to our raise the ring merchandising strategy which resulted in fewer cartons being processed through the distribution centers with higher carton values 
in addition  our emphasis on improved inventory turnover led to lower inventory levels maintained in the distribution centers 
depreciation expense depreciation expense for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the million decrease was principally related to a declining amount of capital expenditures in fiscal years and the lower capital expenditures are principally related to opening stores in fiscal year and a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development of a new point of sale register system and other items generally considered maintenance capital items for our distribution centers and stores in fiscal year fiscal year capital expenditures included capital related to the completion of reengineering of our columbus  ohio distribution center 
upon the successful completion of a pilot program in of our stores and the decision to move forward with the implementation of a new point of sale system in all of our stores  we reduced the remaining estimated service life on approximately million of certain point of sale equipment 
the impact of this service life reduction was to recognize approximately million of depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the estimated remaining service life was based on our projected roll out schedule to all remaining stores  approximately one half in fiscal year and one half in fiscal year interest expense interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the million decrease in interest expense was principally due to lower average borrowings of million in fiscal year compared to average borrowings of million in fiscal year interest and investment income interest and investment income increased million in fiscal year to million compared to million in fiscal year because we generated significant cash flow from our operations  we were in an invested position throughout the majority of fiscal year we invested primarily in money market type investments that are considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds 
income taxes our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year in fiscal year  we benefited from a reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of our expectation of utilizing more net operating loss benefits and the resolution of certain income tax matters 
the rate was lower in fiscal year principally due to proportionately larger jurisdictional losses in entities with higher marginal income tax rates  lower overall income before income taxes  and loss contingency activity partially offset by higher write down of deferred income tax assets as a result of state tax law changes 
the company anticipates the fiscal year effective income tax rate to be within a range of to 
discontinued operations we recorded income from discontinued operations of million in fiscal year compared to loss from discontinued operations of million in fiscal year the income from discontinued operations in fiscal year was principally comprised of the partial release of our kb bankruptcy lease obligation as defined in note to the consolidated financial statements of million  net of tax  and the release of kb related income tax and sales tax indemnification liabilities of million  net of tax  partially offset by a loss on the sale of the pittsfield  massachusetts distribution center formerly owned by the kb toys business of approximately million  net of tax  and exit related costs on the closed stores of million  net of tax  including a million  pretax pension settlement charge and expenses on the portion of the stores where the leases have not been terminated 
we based the revision of the kb bankruptcy lease obligation on the number of demand notices that we have received from landlords and used information received from kb toys  the bankruptcy trust  and our own lease records which date back to when we owned the kb toys business 
additionally  we released the tax indemnification liabilities in light of information that we received as a result of our settlement discussions with the bankruptcy trust and kb in an attempt to resolve the tax indemnification claims 
our loss from discontinued operations in fiscal year included million  net of tax  primarily related to exit costs and fiscal year results of operations of the stores  million of income  net of tax  for the reversal of liabilities associated with the kb toys business  and million  net of tax  associated with the write down of the pittsfield  massachusetts distribution center to fair value less selling cost  upon classification as held for sale 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year this increase is due to new stores opened in fiscal years and and the comparable store sales increase of for fiscal year from a merchandise perspective  home  which includes furniture  was the best performing category 
as part of our merchandising initiatives  clearance markdowns  primarily in the fourth quarter  benefited net sales and comparable store sales and were initiated to reduce inventory levels on slower moving items or classifications 
net sales by product category  net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales  and the net sales change in dollars and percentage in fiscal year compared to fiscal year were as follows fiscal year change in thousands consumables    home    seasonal and toys    other    net sales    the consumables category includes sales increases in plastics  paper  and food  partially offset by a decrease in health and beauty 
the home category includes strong performance in furniture and home decor 
seasonal and toys includes sales increases for lawn garden and toys  partially offset by decreases in trim a tree and harvest 
the other category includes strong performances in electronics  home appliances  and tools 
gross margin gross margin dollars increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this gross margin rate decline of basis points was primarily due to clearance related markdowns  higher inbound freight costs  and certain initial markup related cost pressures such as higher resin based material costs 
inbound freight costs were higher as a result of higher fuel costs and transportation capacity constraints 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal year primarily due to costs associated with higher levels of sales and increased carton volume 
the million increase was primarily attributable to increased store payroll costs of million  increased store occupancy related costs  including rent and utilities  of million  increased general office costs of million  the partial charge off of the hcc note of million as defined in note to the consolidated financial statements  increased advertising costs of million  and increased distribution and transportation costs of million 
the increase in general office cost primarily resulted from an increase in wage and benefit related costs 
outbound distribution and transportation costs  which were included in selling and administrative expenses see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements increased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year outbound distribution and transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the basis point decrease was primarily due to improved efficiency at the distribution centers  particularly the durant  oklahoma distribution center 
in addition  productivity has improved at the columbus distribution center after two years of re engineering efforts 
partially offsetting these cost savings were higher diesel fuel costs incurred on outbound freight and higher utility costs at the distribution centers 
depreciation expense depreciation expense for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the million increase was principally related to new store growth 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the million decrease in interest expense was due to the million debt prepayment charge incurred in fiscal year in connection with the repayment of the million in senior notes privately placed in the senior notes and the retirement of the million secured revolving credit agreement entered into in the credit agreement  lower average borrowings in fiscal year  and a lower effective interest rate in fiscal year the prepayment charge was incurred in order to replace the senior notes  which carried a weighted average yield of  and the credit agreement with the variable rate credit agreement 
the weighted average interest rate of the outstanding loans under the credit agreement at january   was 
income taxes the effective income tax rate of the continuing operations of the company was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the rate was lower in fiscal year because of proportionately larger jurisdictional losses in entities with higher marginal income tax rates  and the adjustment of loss contingencies to recognize the expiration of the statute of limitations  offset by the write down of deferred income tax assets as a result of state tax law changes including ohio tax reform enacted in the second quarter of fiscal year 
discontinued operations we recorded a pretax loss of million from discontinued operations in fiscal year compared to a pretax loss of million in fiscal year our results of discontinued operations in fiscal year include pretax losses in the amount of million as the result of stores reported in discontinued operations in fiscal year which include million of exit related pretax costs incurred primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the reversal of pretax charges of million associated with the kb toys business and pretax charges of million associated with the reclassification of the pittsfield distribution center pittsfield dc as held for sale and the related write down of its carrying value to fair value less selling cost 
our discontinued operations in fiscal year relate to pretax losses in the amount of million as the result of the stores reported in discontinued operations and pretax charges of million associated with the kb toys business 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources on october   we entered into the million credit agreement which is scheduled to terminate on october  the proceeds of the credit agreement are available for general corporate purposes  working capital  and to repay certain of our indebtedness 
the pricing and fees related to the credit agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating 
loans made under the credit agreement may be prepaid by us without penalty 
the credit agreement contains financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  limitations on indebtedness  liens  and investments  as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
a violation of these covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement  which would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the credit agreement for loans and letters of credit  and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the credit agreement 
on december   we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement in order to permit us to acquire investments rated by a third rating agency 
on october   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement in order to eliminate the impact on the covenant calculations of the charges related to the store closings discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with our amended financial covenants under the credit agreement at february  the credit agreement permits  at our option  borrowings at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or london interbank offering rate plus applicable margin 
the credit agreement also permits  as applicable  borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by us and the lenders 
we typically repay and or borrow on a daily basis in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement 
the daily activity is a net result of our liquidity position  which is generally affected by cash inflows such as store cash and other miscellaneous deposits  and cash outflows such as check clearings  wire and other electronic transactions  and other miscellaneous disbursements 
in addition to revolving credit loans  the credit agreement includes a million swing loan sub limit  a million bid loan sub limit  and a million letter of credit sub limit 
at february   we did not have borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
the borrowings available under the credit agreement  after taking into account the reduction of availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling million  were million at february  we utilize our credit facility primarily to manage ongoing and seasonal working capital 
given the seasonality of our business  the amount of borrowings under the credit agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors  including our performance  the time of year  and our need to acquire merchandise inventory 
we anticipate total indebtedness under the facility will be less than million through the end of may  all of which will be comprised of letters of credit  excluding any impact from the execution of the million share repurchase authorized by our board of directors in march liquidity the primary source of our liquidity is cash flows from operations and  as necessary  borrowings under the credit agreement 
at february   working capital was million  including million of money market investments included in cash and cash equivalents 
cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal year and resulted primarily from net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a reduction in inventories of million  timing associated with current income taxes of million  and improved accounts payable leverage of million 
lower inventories are principally due to our continued efforts to improve the inventory turnover rate and to keep store merchandise fresh 
our income tax position was favorable because we received income tax refunds in fiscal year related primarily to the overpayment of taxes in fiscal year and had income taxes payable of approximately million at the end of fiscal year we improved our accounts payable leverage principally by extending payment terms to foreign vendors 
cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal year and resulted primarily from net loss of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million  and a decrease in net assets of million over fiscal year the million decrease in net assets was primarily a result of lower inventory of million  higher accounts payable of million  higher other current liabilities of million  and cash from other assets and liabilities of million 
the reduction in inventory is primarily a result of fewer stores open at the end of fiscal year compared to prior year and the impact of the markdown clearance sales 
the increase in other current liabilities is primarily due to the increased current portion of lease obligation resulting from the closure of certain stores before their full lease term expired 
the cash from other assets and liabilities is primarily due to the non current portion of the lease obligation associated with the closed stores and an increase in the non current portion of insurance reserves for workers compensation and general liability 
cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year was primarily related to capital expenditures of million and million in each of the respective fiscal years 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were primarily related to opening new stores  software development cost for our new point of sale system  and various distribution center  store  or lease related requirements 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were primarily due to opening new stores 
capital expenditure requirements in fiscal year are anticipated to range between million and million  focused on the new register system being implemented in approximately one half of our stores  maintaining existing property and equipment  a limited number of new store openings  and information technology enhancements 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal year and related principally to the million share repurchase program partially offset by million of stock option exercise proceeds  million of proceeds from selling one of our owned store properties  and million for the excess tax benefit derived from the exercise of stock options by employees 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal year and related primarily to the net repayment of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
we announced a share repurchase program of up to million on march  see item of this form k for more information regarding this program 
we continue to believe that we have  or  if necessary  have the ability to obtain adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures 
additionally  management is not aware of any current trends  events  demands  commitments  or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on our capital resources or liquidity 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due under our contractual obligations at february  payments due by period less than more than year to years to years years total in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations    purchase obligations      other long term liabilities      total contractual obligations    the disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this report 
those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate  consequently  the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that we ultimately incur 
variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from those actually incurred include  but are not limited to the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration  fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation  the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by us as of the date of this report  fluctuations in third party fees  governmental charges  or market rates that we are obligated to pay under contracts we have with certain vendors  and the exercise of renewal options under  or the automatic renewal of  contracts that provide for the same 
long term debt obligations consist of the borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement are permitted under various interest rate options based on the prime rate or london interbank offering rate plus applicable margin  as well as borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by us and the lenders 
we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million at february  approximately million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and we do not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit  accordingly  they have been excluded from the preceding table 
the remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in purchase obligations 
for a further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating lease obligations include  among other items  leases for our retail stores  warehouse space  offices  and certain computer and other business equipment 
the future minimum commitments for store and warehouse space operating leases are million 
for a discussion of leases  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
many of the store lease obligations require us to pay for cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
we estimate that future obligations for cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance are million at february  we have made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for our contractual obligations relative to cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
those assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to extrapolation of historical data to estimate our future obligations  calculation of our obligations based on per square foot averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold  and assumptions related to certain increases over historical data where our obligation is a prorated share of all lessees obligations within a particular property 
the remaining million relates primarily to the operating leases for computer and other business equipment 
for purposes of the operating lease and purchase obligation disclosures  we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date  and we disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and our vendor  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term  we disclosed our minimum commitment under such obligation  such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term  due to the uncertainty of the length of the eventual term 
purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise issued in the ordinary course of our business that are valued at million  the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of february  purchase obligations also include a commitment for future inventory purchases totaling million at february  while we are not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment  for purposes of this tabular disclosure  we have included the value of the purchases that we anticipate making during each of the reported periods  as purchases will count toward our fulfillment of the aggregate obligation 
the remaining million is primarily related to distribution and transportation commitments 
other long term liabilities include our obligation related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan  the million closed store lease termination costs  and the expected pension plan contributions 
we have estimated the payments due by period for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan based on an average of historical distributions 
our closed store lease termination cost payments are based on contractual terms 
pension contributions are equal to expected benefit payments for the nonqualified plan plus expected contributions to the qualified plan using actuarial estimates and assuming that we only make the minimum required contributions see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plans 
the obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities  guarantees  and indemnities related to kb toys 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of february   we have approximately kb lease obligations related to kb toys stores and main office building 
the relevant guarantees were issued prior to january   and are not subject to the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
the typical kb lease obligation provides that the terms of the underlying lease may be extended  amended  or modified without the consent of the guarantor 
as a result  we are unable to estimate any potential range of loss in the event of non performance by kb toys 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion of kb toys matters 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  long lived assets  insurance reserves  income taxes  contingencies  leases  pension  revenue recognition  and stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to reporting our results of operations and financial position 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our accounting policies 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
under the average cost retail inventory method  inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics  at its current retail selling value 
inventory retail selling values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates  such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and gross margin 
these assumptions are based on historical experience and current information 
permanent markdowns are recorded as a gross margin reduction in the period of management s decision to initiate price reductions with the intent not to return the price to regular retail 
promotional markdowns are recorded as a gross margin reduction in the period the merchandise is sold 
factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise  and seasonal trends 
shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories and gross margin and is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period 
such estimates are based on our actual experience and our most recent physical inventory results 
while it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage  we have loss prevention programs and policies that we believe minimize shrinkage 
long lived assets depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment are recorded on a straight line basis using estimated service lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis using the shorter of their estimated service lives or the lease term 
when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated service life  depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated service life 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
major repairs that extend service lives are capitalized 
the estimated service lives of property and equipment by major asset category are as follows land improvements years buildings and leasehold improvements years fixtures and equipment years computer software costs years transportation equipment years we have long lived assets that consist primarily of property and equipment 
we review historical operating results at the store level in order to determine if impairment indicators are present 
impairment is recorded if impairment indicators are present and if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows 
our assumptions related to estimates of future cash flows are based on historical results of cash flows adjusted for management projections for future periods 
we estimate service lives on buildings and equipment using assumptions based on historical data and industry trends 
we estimate the fair value of our long lived assets using readily available market information for similar assets 
when material  we classify the results of operations of closed stores as discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the stores have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations and we no longer have any significant continuing involvement in the operations associated with the stores after closure 
we generally meet the second criteria on all closed stores as  upon closure  operations cease and we have no continuing involvement 
to determine if cash flows have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations  we evaluate a number of qualitative and quantitative factors  including  but not limited to  proximity to remaining open stores and estimates of sales migration from the closed store to any stores remaining open 
the estimated sales migration is based on our historical estimates of sales migration upon opening or closing a store in a similar market 
for purposes of reporting the operations of stores meeting the criteria for discontinued operations  we report net sales  gross margin  and related operating costs that are directly related to and specifically identifiable with respect to those stores operations as discontinued operations 
certain corporate level charges  such as general office cost  field operations  national advertising  fixed distribution costs  and interest cost are not allocated to discontinued operations because we believe that these costs are not specific to the stores operations 
insurance reserves we are self insured for certain losses relating to property  general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical and dental benefit claims  a portion of which is paid by employees 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit significant exposure in these areas 
accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
the estimated accruals are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account known trends and projections of future results 
general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted 
to the extent that subsequent claim costs vary from estimates  future earnings could be impacted materially 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies including legal actions  lease termination obligations on closed stores  lease indemnification obligations on kb toys stores and main office building  and other claims arising out of the normal course of our business 
in connection with such claims and contingencies  we estimate the likelihood and amounts of any potential obligation using management s judgment 
management uses various internal and external experts to assist in the estimating process  however  the ultimate outcome of the various claims and contingencies could be materially different from management s estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 
with respect to the lease termination obligations and lease indemnification obligations  we consider the remaining minimum lease payments  estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained  and other potentially mitigating factors 
in addition  as market conditions or other factors change  the estimate of the obligations could be materially different 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our recorded obligations for claims and contingences based on current information  including settlement amounts of individual lease obligations compared to recorded contractual obligations 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable  or if it is probable but an estimate is not determinable  disclosure of a material claim or contingency is made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  because it is not permissible to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
lease accounting rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease 
we recognize minimum rent starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord  which normally includes a construction period prior to store opening 
when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent  we recognize the related rent expense on a straight line basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred incentive rent 
we also receive tenant allowances  which are recorded in deferred rent and are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease 
certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception 
contingent rent includes rent based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level 
contingent rent is excluded from minimum rent and is included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
pension pension assumptions are evaluated each year 
actuarial valuations are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated obligations for pension 
we review external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return 
our objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date 
in making this estimate  we review rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
this process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of aa or better 
the expected long term rate of return on assets was derived from detailed periodic studies  which include a review of asset allocation strategies  anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes  risks standard deviations  and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plan s asset mix 
while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  the assumption is primarily a long term  prospective rate of return 
the discount rates used to determine the net periodic pension cost for fiscal year were to 
a decrease in the discount rates would increase net periodic pension cost by million 
the long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in fiscal year was 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by million 
revenue recognition we recognize sales at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise 
all sales are net of discounts and returns and exclude sales tax 
the reserve for merchandise returns is estimated based on our prior experience 
we recognize sales revenue related to gift cards at the time of redemption 
the liability for the gift cards is established for the cash value at the time of purchase 
the liability for outstanding gift cards is recorded in accrued operating expenses 
we offer price hold contracts on selected furniture merchandise 
revenue for price hold contracts is recognized when the customer makes the final payment and takes possession of the merchandise 
amounts paid by customers under price hold contracts are recorded in accrued operating expenses until a sale is consummated 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january   under the modified prospective method  in which the requirements of sfas no 
r are to be applied to new awards and to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date 
the modified prospective method does not require restatement of previous years financial statements 
we used the short cut method to determine our beginning excess tax benefit pool 
the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow 
we value and expense stock options with graded vesting as a single award with an average estimated life over the entire term of the award 
the expense is recorded straight line over the vesting period 
the fair value of restricted common shares is measured at the grant date and is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
compensation expense for performance based restricted common shares is recorded based on the estimated achievement date of the performance criteria 
compensation expense for all share based awards is recognized in selling and administrative expense 
we use a binomial model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted on or after february  the fair value of stock options granted prior to february   was determined using the black scholes model 
the binomial model takes into account variables such as volatility  dividend yield rate  risk free rate  contractual term of the option  the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life  and the probability of retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option 
expected volatility was based in part on historical and current implied volatilities from traded options on our common shares 
the risk free rate was based on us treasury security yields at the time of the grant 
the dividend yield on our common shares was assumed to be zero since we have not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future 
the expected life was determined from the binomial model 
the model incorporated exercise and post vesting forfeiture assumptions based on analysis of historical data 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statement no 
   and r 
sfas no 
required us to recognize in the february   statement of financial position an asset for the over funded status or a liability for the under funded status of a defined benefit plan and beginning in fiscal year  to recognize annual changes in gains or losses  prior service costs  or other credits that have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost  net of tax through other comprehensive income 
effective in fiscal year  sfas no 
also requires us to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of our year end consolidated balance sheet 
currently  our pension plans have a measurement date of december switching to the new measurement date will require a one time adjustment in fiscal year to retained earnings per the transition guidance in sfas no 
we adopted the funding recognition provisions of sfas no 
in fiscal year to properly report the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plan pension plan and nonqualified supplemental defined benefit pension plan supplemental pension plan we recognized a million charge  net of tax benefit of million  in accumulated other comprehensive income principally comprised of million of prior service costs and million of actuarial loss 
we expect to reclassify million of the prior service cost and million of the actuarial loss into earnings during fiscal year prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we combined the pension plan and supplemental pension plan for purposes of reporting any net pension asset or obligation 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 based on the december  plan valuations  we recognized a million asset included in other assets for the pension plan and a million liability  million of which was included in accrued salaries and wages and million of which was included in other liabilities  for the supplemental pension plan 
in fiscal year  we began reporting separately the pension impact to cash provided by operations on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
prior periods were reclassified to be consistent with the current year presentation 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on net income in fiscal year in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is effective as of the beginning of fiscal year fin is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
fin requires us to recognize in our financial statements the impact of an income tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained  based on the technical merits of the position 
the recognition and measurement guidelines of fin will be applied to all of our income tax positions as of the beginning of fiscal year  with any resulting adjustment posted as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to beginning retained earnings of fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on its financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance to registrants for assessing materiality 
sab no 
states that registrants should use both a balance sheet approach and income statement approach when quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement 
sab no 
also provides guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach as well as transition guidance for correcting previously immaterial errors that are now considered material 
we adopted sab no 
as of february   without any impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
addresses how companies should approach measuring fair value when required by gaap 
sfas no 
does not create or modify any gaap requirements to apply fair value accounting 
the standard provides a single definition of fair value that is to be applied consistently for all accounting applications and also generally describes and prioritizes according to reliability the methods and inputs used in valuations 
sfas no 
prescribes additional disclosures regarding the extent of fair value measurements included in a company s financial statements and the methods and inputs used to arrive at these values 
sfas no 
is effective on a prospective basis for us in the first quarter of fiscal year we expect no significant impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity from adopting this statement 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas no 
will be effective at the beginning of fiscal year we are presently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on our results of operations and financial position 
commitments for a discussion of commitments  refer to note  note  note  and note to the consolidated financial statements herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates associated with investments that we make from time to time and the credit agreement 
we had no fixed rate long term debt at february  we do not expect changes in interest rates in fiscal year to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  however  there can be no assurances that interest rates will not materially change 
we do not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of in interest rates would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity
