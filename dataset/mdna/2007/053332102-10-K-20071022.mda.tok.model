results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal for the year ended august   autozone reported net sales of billion compared with billion for the year ended august   a increase from fiscal this growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open stores 
at august   we operated  domestic stores and in mexico  compared with  domestic stores and in mexico at august  domestic retail sales increased and domestic commercial sales decreased from prior year 
alldata and mexico sales increased over prior year  contributing percentage points of the total increase in net sales 
domestic same store sales  or sales for domestic stores open at least one year  increased from the prior year 
gross profit for fiscal was billion  or of net sales  compared with billion  or of net sales  for fiscal the improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management initiatives and supply chain efficiencies 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to billion  or of net sales  from billion  or of net sales for fiscal the increase in expenses is driven primarily by higher occupancy cost versus the prior year 
interest expense  net for fiscal was million compared with million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher short term rates and higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and the recognition of interest expense on capital lease obligations that were accounted for as operating leases prior to a modification to the lease agreements in fiscal average borrowings for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal weighted average borrowing rates were at august   compared to at august  our effective income tax rate decreased to of pre tax income for fiscal as compared to for fiscal primarily due to benefits from changes in our pre tax earnings mix and an increase in certain federal and state tax credits 
refer to note d income taxes for additional information regarding our income tax rate 
net income for fiscal increased by to million  and diluted earnings per share increased by to from in fiscal the impact of the fiscal stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal was an increase of approximately fiscal compared with fiscal for the year ended august   autozone reported sales of billion compared with billion for the year ended august   a increase from fiscal this growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open stores 
at august   we operated  domestic stores and in mexico  compared with  domestic stores and in mexico at august  domestic retail sales increased and domestic commercial sales decreased from prior year 
alldata and mexico sales increased over prior year  contributing percentage points of the total increase 
same store sales  or sales for domestic stores open at least one year  increased from the prior year 
gross profit for fiscal was billion  or of net sales  compared with billion  or of net sales  for fiscal the improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management initiatives  partially off set by increases in certain commodity costs 
our ongoing category management initiatives have included continued optimization of merchandise assortment and pricing  management of procurement costs  and an increasing focus on direct importing initiatives 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to billion  or of net sales  from billion  or of net sales for fiscal expenses for fiscal include a million charge related to accounting for leases see note j leases 
expenses for fiscal include million in share based compensation expense resulting from the current year adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment see note b share based payments 
the remaining increase in expenses is driven by initiatives to improve the customer s shopping experience and higher occupancy costs driven largely by the opening of new stores 
these initiatives continue to include expanded hours of operation  enhanced training programs and ensuring clean  well merchandised stores 
interest expense  net for fiscal was million compared with million during fiscal this increase was due to a higher average borrowing rate  partially offset by lower average borrowing levels 
average borrowings for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal weighted average borrowing rates were at august   compared to at august  the increase in interest rates reflects both the ongoing effort to extend the terms of our borrowings  as well as the impact from increased short term rates 
our effective income tax rate increased to of pre tax income for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the fiscal effective income tax rate reflects million in tax benefits related to the repatriation of mexican earnings as a result of the american jobs creation act of see note d income taxes  and other discrete income tax items 
net income for fiscal decreased by to million  and diluted earnings per share increased by to from in fiscal the impact of the fiscal stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal was an increase of approximately seasonality and quarterly periods autozone s business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months of march through august  in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about to higher than in the slower months of december through february 
during short periods of time  a store s sales can be affected by weather conditions 
extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products 
mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather 
over the longer term  the effects of weather balance out  as we have stores throughout the united states and mexico 
each of the first three quarters of autozone s fiscal year consists of weeks  and the fourth quarter consists of weeks 
because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of weeks  compared with weeks for each of the first three quarters  our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income 
the fourth quarter of fiscal represented of annual sales and of net income  the fourth quarter of fiscal represented of annual sales and of net income  and the fourth quarter of fiscal represented of annual sales and of net income 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories 
our new store development program requires working capital  predominantly for inventories 
during the past three fiscal years  we have maintained an accounts payable to inventory ratio of at august   at august   and at august  the increase in merchandise inventories  required to support new store development and sales growth  has largely been financed by our vendors  as evidenced by our accounts payable to inventory ratio 
contributing to this ratio is the use of pay on scan pos arrangements with certain vendors 
under a pos arrangement  autozone will not purchase merchandise supplied by a vendor until that merchandise is ultimately sold to autozone s customers 
upon the sale of the merchandise to autozone s customers  autozone recognizes the liability for the goods and pays the vendor in accordance with the agreed upon terms 
revenues under pos arrangements are included in net sales in the income statement 
since we do not own merchandise under pos arrangements until just before it is sold to a customer  such merchandise is not included in our balance sheet 
merchandise under pos arrangements was million at august  autozone s primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program 
from the beginning of fiscal to august   we have opened net new stores 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal we invested million in capital assets in fiscal  compared to million in capital assets in fiscal and million in fiscal new store openings were for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal during fiscal  we began investing a portion of our assets held by the company s wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities 
we acquired million of marketable securities in fiscal and acquired million in fiscal we had proceeds from matured marketable securities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital asset disposals provided million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million for fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the net cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to purchases of treasury stock which totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the treasury stock purchases in fiscal  and were primarily funded by cash flow from operations  and at times  by increases in debt levels 
we expect to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal  primarily related to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and systems 
in addition to the building and land costs  our new store development program requires working capital  predominantly for inventories 
historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers  reducing the working capital required 
we believe that we will be able to continue to finance much of our inventory requirements through favorable payment terms from suppliers 
depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions  we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures  working capital requirements and stock repurchases 
the balance may be funded through new borrowings 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 
credit ratings at august   autozone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from standard poor s of bbb and a commercial paper rating of a moody s investors service had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of baa and a commercial paper rating of p as of august   moody s and standard poor s had autozone listed as having a stable outlook 
if our credit ratings drop  our interest expense may increase  similarly  we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised 
if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels  we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will increase  as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit 
if our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade  our access to financing may become more limited 
debt facilities we maintain billion of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks to primarily support commercial paper borrowings  letters of credit and other short term unsecured bank loans 
these facilities expire in may  may be increased to billion at autozone s election  may include up to million in letters of credit  and may include up to million in capital leases 
as the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit  the company had million in available capacity under these facilities at august  the rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of bank of america s base rate or a eurodollar rate each as defined in the facility agreements  or a combination thereof 
our million bank term loan entered in december was amended in april to have similar terms and conditions as the billion credit facilities  but with a december maturity  and was further amended in august to reduce the interest rate on euro dollar loans 
that credit agreement with a group of banks provides for a term loan  which consists of  at our election  base rate loans  eurodollar loans or a combination thereof 
the interest accrues on base rate loans at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus of 
interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage  which can range from basis points to basis points  depending upon our senior unsecured non credit enhanced long term debt rating 
based on our ratings at august   the applicable percentage on eurodollar loans is basis points 
we may select interest periods of one  two  three or six months for eurodollar loans  subject to availability 
interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period  but no less frequently than quarterly 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on december   to effectively fix  based on current debt ratings  the interest rate of the term loan at 
we have the option to extend loans into subsequent interest period s or convert them into loans of another interest rate type 
the entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan will be due and payable in full on december   when the facility terminates 
we may prepay the term loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty  subject to reimbursement of the lenders breakage and redeployment costs in the case of prepayment of eurodollar borrowings 
during april  our million senior notes maturing at that time were repaid with an increase in commercial paper 
on june   we issued million in senior notes due under our existing shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on august  that shelf registration allowed us to sell up to million in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes  including repaying  redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt  and for working capital  capital expenditures  new store openings  stock repurchases and acquisitions 
the remainder of the shelf registration was cancelled in february  our borrowings under our senior notes arrangements contain minimal covenants  primarily restrictions on liens 
under our other borrowing arrangements  covenants include limitations on total indebtedness  restrictions on liens  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a provision where repayment obligations may be accelerated if autozone experiences a change in control as defined in the agreements 
all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 
as of august   we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants 
stock repurchases during  the company announced a program permitting the company to repurchase a portion of its outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by the company s board of directors 
the program was most recently amended in june to increase the repurchase authorization to billion from billion 
from january to august   the company has repurchased a total of million shares at an aggregate cost of billion 
the company repurchased million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million during fiscal  million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million during fiscal  and million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million during fiscal financial commitments the following table shows autozone s significant contractual obligations as of august  total payment due by period contractual less than between between over in thousands obligations year years years years long term debt interest payments operating leases capital leases self insurance reserves construction obligations long term debt balances represent principal maturities  excluding interest 
at august   debt balances due in less than one year of million are classified as long term in our consolidated financial statements  as we have the ability and intent to refinance them on a long term basis 
represents obligations for interest payments on long term debt  including the effect of interest rate hedges 
operating lease obligations include related interest and are inclusive of amounts accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
capital lease obligations include related interest 
the company retains a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation  employee health  general and product liability  property  and automotive insurance 
these amounts represent undiscounted estimates based on actuarial calculations 
although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities  the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns 
accordingly  the company reflects the net present value of these obligations in its consolidated balance sheets 
we have other obligations reflected in our balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities or due to the nature of the account 
therefore  the timing of these payments cannot be determined  except for amounts estimated to be payable in that are included in current liabilities 
we have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these contingent liabilities are not included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august  in thousands total other commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers 
there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
the standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year  but have automatic renewal clauses 
in conjunction with our commercial sales program  we offer credit to some of our commercial customers 
the majority of our receivables related to the credit program are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse 
autozone has recorded a reserve for this recourse 
at august   the receivables facility had an outstanding balance of million and the balance of the recourse reserve was million 
we have entered into pos arrangements with certain vendors  whereby we will not purchase merchandise supplied by a vendor until just before that merchandise is ultimately sold to our customers 
title and certain risks of ownership remain with the vendor until the merchandise is sold to our customers 
since we do not own merchandise under pos arrangements until just before it is sold to a customer  such merchandise is not recorded on our balance sheet 
upon the sale of the merchandise to our customers  we recognize the liability for the goods and pay the vendor in accordance with the agreed upon terms 
although we do not hold title to the goods  we do control pricing and have credit collection risk and therefore  gross revenues under pos arrangements are included in net sales in the income statement 
sales of merchandise under pos arrangements approximated million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal merchandise under pos arrangements was million at august  and million at august  value of pension assets at august   the fair market value of autozone s pension assets was million  and the related accumulated benefit obligation was million based on a may  measurement date 
on january   our defined benefit pension plans were frozen 
accordingly  plan participants earn no new benefits under the plan formulas  and no new participants may join the plans 
the material assumptions for fiscal are an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and a discount rate of

reconciliation of non gaap financial measures selected financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these non gaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value 
non gaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures  or considered in isolation  for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance  financial position or cash flows 
however  we have presented the non gaap financial measures  as we believe they provide additional information to analyze or compare our operations 
furthermore  our management and compensation committee of the board of directors use the abovementioned non gaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performance based compensation 
we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measure cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt the following table reconciles net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents to cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt  which is presented in the selected financial data

critical accounting policies preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions 
our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of sales we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo method 
included in inventory are related purchasing  storage and handling costs 
due to price deflation on the company s merchandise purchases  the company s inventory balances are effectively maintained under the first in  first out method as the company s policy is not to write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments  resulting in cost of sales being reflected at the higher amount 
since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions  our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market 
the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit 
we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs 
additionally  we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrinkage 
our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts 
vendor allowances autozone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors based on the volume of purchases or for services that autozone provides to the vendors 
monies received from vendors include rebates  allowances and promotional funds 
the amounts to be received are subject to purchase volumes and the terms of the vendor agreements  which generally do not state an expiration date  but are subject to ongoing negotiations that may be impacted in the future based on changes in market conditions  vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sell through of the related merchandise 
the company s level of advertising and other operating  selling  general and administrative expenditures are not dependent on vendor allowances 
rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or product sales and are accrued ratably over the purchase or sale of the related product  but only if it is reasonably certain that the required volume levels will be reached 
these monies are recorded as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
for all allowances and promotional funds earned under vendor funding  the company applies the guidance pursuant to the emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor eitf  by recording the vendor funds as a reduction of inventories that are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold 
the company s vendor funding arrangements do not provide for any reimbursement arrangements that are for specific  incremental  identifiable costs that are permitted under eitf for the funding to be recorded as a reduction to advertising or other operating  selling  general and administrative expenses 
impairments in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long lived assets  such as property and equipment  covered by this standard annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of the evaluation  we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment 
we compare the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we perform an annual test of goodwill to compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists 
we perform the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
if impairments are indicated by either of the above evaluations  the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment loss 
such evaluations require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the evaluation is performed  which could differ from actual results 
self insurance we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation  vehicle  employee health  general and product liability and property losses 
liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported 
through various methods  which include analyses of historical trends and utilization of actuaries  the company estimates the costs of these risks 
the actuarial estimated long term portions of these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value  other liabilities are not discounted 
we believe the amounts accrued are adequate  although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided 
we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks 
income taxes we accrue and pay income taxes based on the tax statutes  regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax matters in dispute with state  federal and foreign tax authorities 
management believes the resolution of the current open tax issues will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
litigation and other contingent liabilities we have received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business  such as employment matters  product liability claims and general liability claims related to our store premises 
we calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities 
pension obligation prior to january   substantially all full time employees were covered by a defined benefit pension plan 
the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee s highest consecutive five year average compensation 
on january   the plan was frozen 
accordingly  pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan 
on january   the company s supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen 
accordingly  plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan 
as the plan benefits are frozen  the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels  but are impacted by actuarial calculations using two key assumptions i 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets estimated by considering the composition of our asset portfolio  our historical long term investment performance and current market conditions 
ii 
discount rate used to determine benefit obligations adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date may using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities 
this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year 
if such assumptions differ materially from actual experience  the impact could be material to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk autozone is exposed to market risk from  among other things  changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and fuel prices 
from time to time  we use various financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks 
to date  based upon our current level of foreign operations  hedging costs and past changes in the associated foreign exchange rates  no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk 
all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our board of directors 
further  we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk autozone s financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates 
at times  we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts  treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps 
autozone has historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances 
we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets 
all of the company s interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 
we had an outstanding interest rate swap with a fair value of million at august   and million at august   to effectively fix the interest rate on the million term loan entered into during december the related gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
the company s hedge instrument was determined to be highly effective as of august  the fair value of our debt was estimated at billion as of august   and billion as of august   based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to autozone for debt having the same remaining maturities 
such fair value is less than the carrying value of debt by million at august   and less than the carrying value of debt by million at august  considering the effect of any interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges  we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at august   and million of variable rate debt outstanding at august  at these borrowing levels for variable rate debt  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows of million in and million in  which includes the effects of interest rate swaps 
the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor 
considering the effect of any interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges  we had outstanding fixed rate debt of billion at august   and at august  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by million at august   and million at august  fuel price risk fuel swap contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas and thus do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  although the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel and unleaded fuel exposure 
as of august   the then current month s fuel swap contract was outstanding with a settlement date of august  during fiscal and  we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel exposure 
these swaps were settled within a few days of each fiscal year end and had no significant impact on cost of sales for the or fiscal years 
we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal
