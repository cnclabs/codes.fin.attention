we present below management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of velocity express corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
overview the company is engaged in the business of providing time definite logistics services 
we operate primarily in the united states with limited operations in canada 
the company operates in a single business segment 
the company has one of the largest nationwide networks of time definite logistics solutions in the united states and is a leading provider of scheduled  distribution and expedited logistics services 
its customers are comprised of multi location  blue chip customers in the healthcare  office products  financial  commercial  transportation logistics  retail consumer products  technology  and energy sectors 
our service offerings are divided into the following categories scheduled logistics  consisting of the daily pickup and delivery of parcels with narrowly defined time schedules predetermined by the customer 

table of contents distribution logistics  consisting of the receipt of customer bulk shipments that are divided and sorted at major metropolitan locations for delivery to multiple locations within broadly defined time schedules 
expedited logistics  consisting of unique and expedited point to point service for customers with extremely time sensitive delivery requirements 
the company s customers represent a variety of industries and utilize our services across multiple service offerings 
revenue categories and percentages of total revenue for fiscal years ended  and on an historical basis are as follows fiscal year ended june  july  july  healthcare office products financial services commercial transportation and logistics retail and consumer products energy technology the mix of revenue in reflects the combination with cd l 
cd l s historically greater weighting in healthcare  retail  and transportation and logistics resulted in the relative increase in those categories  whereas cd l s lower weighting in office products  commercial and energy caused the relative decrease in those categories compared to the legacy velocity business in the prior year 
the companies had comparable weightings in the financial services and technology industries 
the following table shows our revenue categories and percentages of revenues for the years ended june  compared to july  on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the cd l acquisition on july  fiscal year ended june  pro forma fiscal year ended july  healthcare office products financial services commercial transportation and logistics retail and consumer products energy and other technology the company had one customer that accounted for more than of our net revenues in fiscal and pro forma our ten largest customers accounted for approximately and of our net revenues in fiscal and pro forma  respectively 
the progression towards larger customers is consistent with our business strategy 
with the enactment of the federal law known as check  on october   we anticipate that financial services revenue will continue to decline as financial institutions migrate to electronically scanned and processed checks  without the need to move the physical documents to the clearing institution 
off setting this relative decline in revenue in the financial services industry  we believe we will benefit from the growth in healthcare and retail industries including office supplies within the united states  and be able to effectively leverage our broad coverage footprint to capitalize on this national growth industry 

table of contents the company had a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june   including a net loss of million for the three months ended june   which resulted in cash used in operating activities for the year of million 
in fiscal year  the company financed this operating cash flow deficit through net proceeds of million from a revolving credit facility and improvements in working capital management 
see liquidity and capital resources 
cd l acquisition related transactions on july   the company  its wholly owned subsidiary cd l acquisition corp merger sub and cd l  entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement to acquire cd l 
cd l was another leading provider of time definite logistics services 
the merger agreement provided that  at the closing  following cd l shareholder approval  merger sub would be merged with and into cd l the merger  with each then outstanding share of common stock of cd l being converted into the right to receive per share in cash 
as a result of the merger  which closed on august   cd l became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
contemporaneously with the signing of the merger agreement  the company sold  units  each of which was comprised of a  aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior secured notes due and b a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment from time to time the units  sold  shares of series q convertible preferred stock  each of which was initially convertible into shares of common stock the series q preferred stock  acquired approximately of cd l s outstanding common stock in consideration for which the company issued  units valued at their par value of million   shares of common stock valued at million or per share  equal to the closing price of common shares on the day the final terms of the transaction were agreed  and paid million in cash  pursuant to purchase agreements entered into with the holders of certain of cd l s convertible debentures and convertible preferred stock  repaid approximately million of indebtedness owed to bank of america  na repaid approximately million of indebtedness owed to bet associates  lp at the closing of the merger on august   the company acquired the remaining of cd l s outstanding common stock  repaid approximately million of indebtedness owed by cd l to bank of america  na  paid off approximately million of cd l seller financed debt from previous acquisitions  and paid million to the former chairman and chief executive officer of cd l in fulfillment the change of control provision in his employment agreement on august   the company sold an additional  shares of series q preferred stock 
in total  the aggregate net cash proceeds from the sale of the units were approximately million and from the sale of the series q preferred stock were approximately million 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to finance the cd l acquisition  approximately million were used to repay indebtedness owed by us to bank of america  na million  bet associates  lp million  approximately million were used to repay cd l seller financed debt from previous acquisitions  approximately million were used to repay cd l s line of credit facility and million was retained for general corporate purposes 
see liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  the company granted customary registration rights with respect to the shares of the company s common stock issuable upon conversion of the series q preferred stock and the warrants 

table of contents management believes that the acquisition of cd l has benefited the company in several ways 
the combined company has increased its annual revenues  and has approximately  independent contractor drivers operating from locations in leading markets across the united states and canada 
in addition  the combination is proving to show the following strategic and financial benefits increased market coverage due to a combination of routes of the two companies providing our customers with a broader national reach  superior customer programs combining proprietary track and trace and electronic signature capture technology  which we believe is the industry s best service offering in the time definite delivery industry  a diverse and expanded customer base across multiple market sectors  including healthcare  retail  service parts replenishment and financial industries  among others  a strengthening of our already excellent managerial team  and substantial costs savings through operational synergies and elimination of redundant expenses 
restructurings in   and the company implemented several restructurings that management believes have repositioned the company for greater success in the future 
in  the company conducted an analysis of its route profitability that indicated the company was operating in a number of locations that did not have sufficient customer density for the company to profitably deliver its targeted service levels 
as a result  at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  the company closed over of its locations primarily smaller facilities in low density areas  terminated several unprofitable customer contracts and reduced employee headcount by approximately at that time  the company recorded a charge of  related to the restructuring  mostly reflective of severance costs 
during the final quarter of fiscal  the company ceased use of most of the named facilities and recorded an additional  in net lease contract termination costs and fixed asset impairments  recorded  in severance costs and recorded an estimated  charge to recognize the cost of service contracts that had no future economic benefit to the company 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a charge of  related to severance and benefits for the termination of approximately employees and revised its estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities 
for fiscal  the company s revenue declined largely due to lower volume experienced as a result of the restructuring implemented at the end of the company s third quarter of fiscal the revenue decline was partially offset by new customer contracts and business expansion with existing customers approximating million 
for more information  see note restructuring to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  during  in conjunction with the integration of cd l  management identified operational synergies of the combined companies and executed its plan for staff reductions of approximately employees  including a retention incentive program for key individuals  and the closing of redundant operating centers 
in  the company recorded a charge of approximately million associated with the reduction of workforce  million in retention bonuses and approximately million in lease contract termination costs associated with the integration 
to date  all planned locations have been vacated as a result of facility consolidations 
in addition  a charge of approximately  was recorded related to revisions in the company s estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with prior period restructurings 
as a result of the integration of cd l  the company reduced annualized expenses in delivery operations  primarily resulting from occupancy and staff cost reductions resulting from the consolidation of facilities in the same geographic area  and in general and administrative expenses through the elimination of duplicate management  public company expenses and insurance coverage  by a total of approximately million 

table of contents factors affecting future results of operations our revenues consist primarily of charges to customers for delivery services and weekly or monthly charges for recurring services  such as facilities management 
sales are recognized when the service is performed 
the revenue and profit for a particular service is dependent upon a number of factors  including size and weight of articles transported  distance transported  special handling requirements  requested delivery time and local market conditions 
generally  articles of greater weight transported over longer distances and those that require special handling produce higher revenue 
we are continually engaged in bidding for additional contract work for a variety of new and existing customers 
we believe our current pipeline of bidding activity remains robust  with potential customers that could generate annual billings of up to million  although we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining these clients 
the activity is consistent across all geographic regions in which we operate 
full implementation of newly awarded contracts generally takes from thirty to ninety days 
cost of services consists of costs relating directly to performance of our services  including driver and messenger costs  transportation services purchased from third parties  and costs to staff  equip and insure our warehouse facilities 
substantially all of the drivers we use are independent contractors who provide their own vehicles 
as of june   we owned no motor vehicles in the united states and only three in canada 
drivers and messengers are compensated based on a combination of the number of stops they make  the number of packages they deliver and or a percentage of the delivery charge 
consequently  our driver  messenger and purchased transportation costs are variable in nature 
we also employ workers in our own leased warehouse facilities and certain facilities owned by our customers 
the salary and employee benefit costs related to them  such as payroll taxes and insurance  are also included in cost of sales 
cost of services for was million  an increase of million  or  from million for the increase was disproportionate to the increase in revenue primarily due to the acquisition of cd l which added approximately million in cost reflecting lower margins on cd l revenue 
we have focused on reducing our costs through the following two initiatives implementing our proprietary route management technology to optimize routes structures at each location for the maximum number of stops per day for each driver thereby allowing us to improve our gross margins  and the completion of the conversion of our workforce from employee drivers to independent contractors  which creates a more variable cost structure and higher gross margins 
these two initiatives will result in trucks that carry larger loads on denser routes  fewer more satisfied drivers making more money  and better customer service at lower costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include salaries  wages and benefit costs incurred at the branch level related to taking orders and dispatching drivers and messengers  as well as administrative costs related to such functions 
also included in sg a expenses are regional and corporate level marketing and administrative costs and occupancy costs related to branch and corporate locations 
during fiscal  we plan to continue to invest in technologies that will increase our competitive advantage in the market by providing enhanced package tracking and increased productivity from both a frontline delivery and back office perspective 
during fiscal years and  we spent more than million in the development and implementation of route management software solutions that have proven to have had a significant impact on reducing overall delivery cost and enhancing our ability to better manage our variable operating cost 
during fiscal year  we spent million in the development of package tracking technology 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill  insurance reserves  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition revenue from our same day transportation and distribution logistics services is recognized when services are rendered to customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
estimates are used in determining this allowance based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances or write off may be required 
financial instruments financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair values at the time of issuance 
multiple financial instruments issued in a transaction are recorded at their relative fair values using black scholes and other valuation techniques 
those recorded as liabilities are remeasured at each reporting period with changes in fair value reported in operations 
financial instruments issued to settle obligations are valued at their fair value on the day of issuance 
differences between fair value and carrying value are recognized in operations 
goodwill impairment our goodwill is subjected to impairment testing  which requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
in order to determine the fair value of velocity express  we employed the implied enterprise value technique based on our publicly traded stock price  an approach widely accepted in determining fair value for an enterprise 
the fair value derived was in excess of the carrying amount of goodwill and  therefore  no adjustment for impairment was required in fiscal year insurance reserves during the third quarter of fiscal year  we initiated an insurance program with minimal or no deductibles 
prior to that time  we maintained an insurance program with policies that had various higher deductible levels 
we reserved the estimated amounts of uninsured claims and deductibles related to such insurance retentions for claims that had occurred in the normal course of our business 
these reserves have been established by management based upon the recommendations of third party administrators who perform a specific review of open claims  with consideration of incurred but not reported claims  as of the balance sheet date 
actual claim settlements may differ materially from these estimated reserve amounts 
following the acquisition of cd l  the company continued to insure workers compensation risks for the workforce acquired from cd l through insurance policies with substantial deductibles  and retains risk as a result of its deductibles related to such insurance policies 
the company s deductible for workers compensation 
table of contents is  per loss with an annual aggregate stop loss of approximately  the company reserves the estimated amounts of uninsured claims and deductibles related to such insurance retentions for claims that have occurred in the normal course of business 
these reserves are established by management based upon the recommendations of third party administrators who perform a specific review of open claims  which include fully developed estimates of both reported claims and incurred but not reported claims  as of the balance sheet date 
actual claim settlements may differ materially from these estimated reserve amounts 
in january  the company began insuring its entire workforce s workers compensation risks through these insurance policies discussed above with substantial deductibles  and retains risk as a result of its deductibles related to such insurance policies 
as of june   the company has a liability of approximately million for case reserves  development reserves  plus estimated losses incurred  but not reported 
contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies and have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

sfas no 
requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency were settled for an amount greater than the estimate  a future charge to operating results would result 
likewise  if a contingency were settled for an amount that is less than the estimate  a future credit to operating results would result 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the company reports its financial results on a week fiscal year basis 
under this basis  our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to june th 
fiscal years  and all contained weeks 
year ended june  compared to year ended july  revenue for increased by million or to million  from million in the increase in revenue for compared to was the result of adding approximately million of revenue due to the acquisition of cd l  million in revenue related to new customer start ups that will yield million in annual revenue  and amortizing into operations million of non cash revenue related to unfavorable contracts purchased with the cd l acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by the loss of approximately million of revenue resulting from losing two customers  a major office supply customer and a significant bank customer  in the second quarter of  and the continued migration of banking customers to the check scanning technology combined with the decrease of remaining residual revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year that resulted from a restructuring completed during the fourth period of fiscal year approximately million of revenue was realized in from customers running out their contractual termination periods 
the inclusion of results from peritas in the current period accounted for million of the increase in revenue 
cost of services for increased by million  or  to million  from million in the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of cd l which added approximately million in cost reflecting lower margins on cd l revenue 
in addition  higher cost of services also reflects costs associated with maintaining high customer service levels while simultaneously accomplishing our field integration objectives  with the largest variances in payments to drivers and messengers  purchased transportation  and warehouse costs 
in addition  the company incurred expenses to convert cd l guaranteed driver settlement practices to the company s activity based driver settlement model 
furthermore  the prior year insurance costs were lower than the current period because of reductions recorded last year to insurance claim reserves 
the higher cost of services was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million of cost of services largely due to the reduced revenue from the loss of two customers and million of amortization of the 
table of contents liability for unfavorable contracts purchased with the cd l acquisition 
the inclusion of results from peritas in the current period accounted for million of the increase cost 
gross margin  as a result of the increase in cost of services  declined from in to in due to the combination of reasons stated above 
occupancy charges for increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in approximately million of the increase resulted from the acquisition of cd l 
as part of the acquisition of cd l  the company ended up with duplicate facilities in numerous locations 
as part of the integration of those facilities  the company has realized million in reduced occupancy costs to date 
as a percentage of revenue  occupancy costs have decreased  from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by million  or  to million or of revenue  as compared with million or of revenue in the increase in sg a resulted primarily from the acquisition of cd l  which added approximately million  in additional expenses 
higher legal fees also added to the increase in sg a 
the increase was partly offset by lower legal settlements 
lower personnel costs contributed to reducing total sg a expense as a percentage of revenue by  from to transaction and integration costs of million for primarily reflected outside consultants  success bonuses and travel costs related to the integration of the cd l operations 
the restructuring and asset impairments expense for was million as compared to million in of the expense recorded in  million was associated with severance and retention incentives as part of the integration of cd l  million was the result of lease terminations as part of the cd l integration  and million related to the write down of peritas vehicles classified as assets held for sale to fair value 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for as compared to million in primarily reflecting the amortization of intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase of cd l which contributed million of expense to net interest expense for increased by million  to million from million in in the prior year period  the interest related primarily to the company s then existing revolving credit facility and subordinated debt 
with the replacement of that debt with the senior notes  the company s interest expense for the current year was comprised of million of interest on the senior notes and revolving credit facility in addition to non cash expense of million that includes amortization of deferred financing charges and accretion of the debt discount relating to the warrants that were issued as a part of the senior notes unit offering 
in addition  interest income  net of miscellaneous interest was million for the current year

year ended july  compared to year ended july  revenue for decreased million  or  to million from million for the decrease in revenue is in large part attributable to lower volume experienced as a result of the restructuring initiated at the end the third fiscal quarter of as described above 
the result was a reduction of weekly revenue 
when annualized over the entire fiscal year  these restructuring actions accounted for approximately million of the million decrease in revenue from the remaining decrease in revenue is attributable to losses associated with pricing pressures and customer freight volume fluctuations of approximately million 
the revenue decline was partially offset by new customer contracts and business expansion with existing customers approximating million 
greater concentration on national account business resulted in an increased proportion of revenues originating from those accounts 
in addition  approximately million of the decrease relates to consolidation of one quarter of revenue from a consolidated variable interest entity  peritas  llc  during compared to the consolidation of two quarters of revenue during cost of services for was million  a reduction of million  or  from million for we have focused on reducing our costs through the following three initiatives implementing our proprietary route management technology to optimize routes structures at each location for the maximum number of stops per day for each driver thereby allowing us to improve our gross margins  the completion of the conversion of our workforce from employee drivers to independent contractors  which creates a more variable cost structure and higher gross margins  and the restructuring of our service network to eliminate low density  low margin locations

decreased volume and closed facilities accounted for million of the decrease  lower vehicle costs accounted for million  lower costs for insurance accounted for million  primarily vehicle insurance million  a decrease in cargo claims together with a change in the estimate for cargo claim reserves accounted for million  introduction of the cargo loss waiver accounted for million  approximately million of the decrease related to the consolidation of one quarter of peritas costs during compared to the consolidation of two quarters of costs during  all partially offset by a million increase in purchased transportation  and the remaining million of the decrease being attributable to driver pay efficiencies gained from our proprietary route management technology 
beginning in april with the restructuring of our operations  we began to realize significant reductions in costs relative to our redefined routes as enabled by our proprietary route management system 
as a result of all the above  the gross margin on service has increased from in to in occupancy charges for were million  a decrease of million  or  from million for the decrease was mainly due to the shut down of facilities in connection with the restructurings described above

changes in internal controls over financial reporting in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended july   due to resource constraints  a material weakness became evident to management regarding our inability to simultaneously close the books on a timely basis each month and generate all the necessary disclosure for inclusion in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
a material weakness is a significant deficiency in one or more of the internal control components that alone or in the aggregate precludes our internal controls from reducing to an appropriately low level the risk that material misstatements in our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
this material weakness was still present at june  we have aggressively recruited experienced professionals to augment and upgrade our financial staff to address issues of timeliness in financial reporting even during periods when we are preparing filings for the securities and exchange commission 
although we believe that this corrective step will enable management to conclude that the internal controls over our financial reporting are effective when all of the additional financial staff positions are filled and the staff is trained and the current surge of integration related tasks have been completed  we cannot assure you these steps will be sufficient 
we may be required to expend additional resources to identify  assess and correct any additional weaknesses in internal control 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview in  the company reported a loss from operations of approximately million  which resulted in negative working capital of approximately million at june  the reasons for the losses are described under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations historical results of operations contained in this report  including  in particular  the continued cost of the integration of cd l 
the cd l integration has taken months longer and cost approximately million more than the company s original estimates 
as a result  the company did not meet the minimum ebitda levels contained in its credit agreement for the period ending march  wells  in its capacity as agent and lender under the credit agreement  granted the company a waiver and then entered into an amendment to the credit agreement dated may  that provided for lower minimum ebitda targets and revised reporting requirements 
notwithstanding the may amendment  due to an unanticipated degree of customer losses related to the migration of financial services customers to electronic check clearing under the federal check initiative and unfavorable contracts the company assumed with the cd l acquisition  the company again did not meet its minimum ebitda levels contained in its credit agreement for the periods ending july  and august  wells  in its capacity as agent and lender under the credit agreement  granted the company waivers and entered into another amended agreement dated october  which included lower monthly minimum ebitda requirements through december and an increase in the interest rate of basis points in libor margin from to until trailing twelve month ebitda equals million  dropping to a basis point increase when trailing twelve month ebitda is greater than million and reverting back to the original interest rate when trailing twelve month ebitda is greater than million 
the company is managing to an operating plan which it expects to result in positive cash flow over the next year 
key components of the operating plan include the following improving gross margins by using our newly integrated route information database to identify and correct a number of specific  predominately legacy cd l routes fewer than of all routes where our average driver settlement has exceeded competitive market norms for the work performed  winding down payments related to restructuring and integration related activities from million in fiscal to less than million in fiscal  lower operating and sg a expenses by reducing headcount  restoring our historical market based deductions from independent contractor settlements to recoup driver support costs not recovered during fiscal  and changing or eliminating services and the related costs associated with telecommunications  workforce acquisition  and miscellaneous other activities  further improvement in gross margins compared to prior quarters  and based on the continuing roll out of the company s route optimization software  which was made possible by the completion of route data migration in fiscal  and increasing profitable revenue growth from recently announced  existing and potential customers in targeted markets  further improving accounts receivable collections resulting from the customer database integration which was completed in fiscal in addition  we expect to further improve our cash position in fiscal by the following steps sale of our canadian subsidiary in the second quarter of fiscal  as negotiations with interested parties have progressed favorably  issuance of approximately  shares of common stock in connection with a private placement to management in july under which selected members of the management team were offered the opportunity to purchase common shares 
 was paid to the company in june  and an 
table of contents additional  is being paid by payroll deductions or scheduled monthly payments during the first half of fiscal  and in connection with a consent solicitation from the holders of the senior notes in july  approximately million was raised from the exercise of approximately million warrants 
see discussion above for more details the company believes that  based on its operating plan  cash to be received from the pending sale of its canadian subsidiary  cash received from a private placement of common stock and warrant exercises in july  and results to date  it will have sufficient cash flow to meet its expected cash needs and to satisfy the covenants contained in the agreements governing its debt including the revised minimum ebitda covenant under the credit agreement in the next twelve month period 
the company is factoring into its plan  among other things  the requirements under the indenture governing the senior notes to maintain a minimum cash balance of million through may   and million thereafter through june   which is subject to adjustment in the event that certain conditions are not met  and to make the december and june interest payments on the senior notes in cash of million each 
as of june   the company had million in cash and million in available borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
based on the current operating plan including the related assumptions  cash to be received from the pending sale of a subsidiary  cash received from a private placement of common stock and warrant exercises in july and results from operations and qualitative feedback from field management since june   the company believes it will be in compliance with its covenants  including those summarized above 
as such  the company believes it will continue to meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business as they become due through june  as with any operating plan  there are risks associated with the company s ability to execute it 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to satisfy the revised minimum ebitda requirement or other applicable covenants to its lenders  or achieve the operating improvements described above 
if the company is unable to execute this plan in general or if  after making the december  or june  interest payment  the company cannot remain in compliance with the minimum cash requirement  it will need to find additional sources of cash not contemplated by the current operating plan and or raise additional capital to sustain continuing operations as currently contemplated

there were no restructuring charges for lease commitments in fiscal year we have entered into subleases for some of this excess space and are in the process of attempting to sublease such space  but it is considered unlikely that any sublease income generated will offset the entire future commitment

in  peritas entered into a million loan and security agreement with comerica  of which of the outstanding amounts due under the line were guaranteed by thlpv 
as a result of borrowings under the agreement  comerica s outstanding debt  net of the guarantee from thlpv  exceeded our variable interest in peritas  and comerica became the primary beneficiary to absorb a majority of peritas expected losses

accordingly  peritas was deconsolidated from our financial statements upon the completion of these transactions during fiscal year as peritas periodically paid down the borrowings under the line with comerica  our receivable with peritas continued to increase 
in march  our variable interest in peritas increased to an amount that exceeded the outstanding balance of

fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition

in september  the securities and exchange commission published staff accounting bulletin no 
 quantifying financial statement misstatements sab 
sab adds section n to topic  financial statements  of the staff accounting bulletin series 
section n provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
registrants electing not to restate prior periods should reflect the effects of initially applying the guidance in topic n in annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the cumulative effect of the initial application should be reported in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that fiscal year  and the offsetting adjustment should be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that year 
early application of the guidance in topic n is encouraged in any report for an interim period of the first fiscal year ending after november  sab did not have a material effect on company s financial statements 
in february the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value at specific election dates 
sfas s objective is to improve financial reporting by reducing both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas requires companies to provide additional information that will help users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
sfas also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the 
table of contents company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new standard does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas  fair value measurements  and sfas  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which means that it will be effective for the company s fiscal year beginning june  the company is in the process of evaluating sfas and therefore has not yet determined the effect that the adoption will have on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations 
we estimate our market risk using sensitivity analysis 
market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair market value of a fixed rate long term debt obligation due to hypothetical adverse change in interest rates and the potential change in interest expense on variable rate long term debt obligations due to a change in market interest rates 
the fair value on long term debt obligations is determined based on discounted cash flow analysis  using the rates and the maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in long term debt markets 
as of september   we had million in aggregate principal amount of fixed rate long term debt obligations with an estimated fair market value of million  based on current asking prices for trades at of face value  with an overall weighted average interest rate of and an overall weighted maturity of  years  compared to rates and maturities currently available in long term debt markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value of our fixed rate long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of in interest rates 
such an increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of million in the fair market value of our fixed rate long term debt 
the company has revolving debt of million at june  that is subject to variable interest rates 
a change in the interest would result in an impact of million in interest expense 
except as described above  we are not currently subject to material market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates or other market price risks
