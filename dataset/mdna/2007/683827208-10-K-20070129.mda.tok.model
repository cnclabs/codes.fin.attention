a decline in the demand for fiber optic cable generally or in certain applications or for tight buffer fiber optic cable specifically or in certain applications  in the markets we target may cause our sales to fall 
fiber optic cable  specifically tight buffer fiber optic cable  accounts for almost all of our sales 
as a result  any decline in the demand for fiber optic cable generally or tight buffer fiber optic cable specifically will likely adversely affect our business and its prospects  including causing our sales to fall  causing our share price to decline and limiting our future sales prospects 
we focus on producing tight buffer fiber optic cable that is used to connect optical networking equipment in short to moderate distance applications  including the enterprise market  and to a lesser extent  the metropolitan and access markets 
our future growth is affected by the rate at which optical networking and related optical cabling are deployed in these markets 
the desire of organizations to deploy fiber optic cabling depends on such factors as end user demand for the increased bandwidth made possible by optical networks  as well as a lack of suitable alternative technologies 
additionally  any decline in the demand for fiber optic cable used in short to moderate distance applications  such as metropolitan  access and enterprise networks  will likely adversely affect our business and its prospects  including causing our sales to fall  limiting our prospects for the future sales and causing a decline in our share price 
if alternative fiber optic cable constructions  such as loose tube fiber optic cable  become more accepted as alternatives to tight buffer fiber optic cable construction in our target markets  then our business and its prospects could be adversely affected  including material decreases in our sales  adverse affects on our future prospects and potential  significant declines in our share price 
our ability to remain competitive in the fiber optic cable market is crucial to our continued success 
the market for fiber optic cables  including the short to moderate distance markets in which our products are concentrated  is highly competitive 
we compete with large  integrated fiber optic cable manufacturers such as corning cabling systems  ofs  alcatel and draka  as well as with other large fiber optic cable manufacturers such as general cable  belden  nexans doing business 
table of contents as berk tek  commscope and others 
some of our competitors are more established  benefit from greater market recognition and have much greater financial  research and development  production and marketing resources than we do 
competition could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines 
we are a microcap stock with little  if any  coverage by security analysts  and with limited institutional following 
therefore  the price of our common shares is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations 
optical cable corporation has a relatively low market capitalization represented by the total number of common shares issued and outstanding multiplied by the price per common share 
often the capital stock of companies with such low market capitalizations are referred to as microcap stocks 
as a result of this low market capitalization  it is quite difficult for us to secure coverage by security analysts and to convince institutional investors to invest substantial amounts in our common shares 
additionally  our low market capitalization makes it likely that the sale or purchase of even relatively small blocks of our common shares can result in significant fluctuations in the price of our common shares with or without any underlying change in our financial performance 
as a result  the price of our common stock is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations 
we believe our quarterly results may tend to fluctuate due to many factors  including timing of key projects  changing levels of corporate and government spending  fluctuations in spending in certain specialty markets we target  seasonality  and manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
the price of our common shares will likely fall if our quarterly results are lower than the expectations of securities analysts  if any  or our shareholders 
we expect our sales and income to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
in future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts  if any securities analysts are offering coverage of us  or our shareholders 
if this occurs  the price of our common shares is likely to fall and you may lose all or part of your investment 
a number of factors  many of which are discussed in more detail in other risk factors  may cause variations in the results of our operations  including  but not limited to the proportion of our net sales made to distributors relative to other types of customers  the proportion of large to small orders  our product mix  including fluctuations in demand in our target and specialty markets  the timing of orders that we receive from our customers  including  larger projects  fluctuations in spending on fiber optic cable in certain specialty markets we target  fluctuations in corporate or government spending  seasonality  including affects of weather  construction and annual budgetary cycles on demand  changes in the general economic conditions whether in the us  other countries or specific regions that impact spending on fiber optic cabling products  changes in the cost and availability of our raw materials  our manufacturing capacity  efficiencies and yield  and spending for fiber optic cabling in the metropolitan  access and enterprise markets 

table of contents a significant percentage of our expenses  including those relating to manufacturing  sales and marketing  and general and administrative functions  are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  if we experience delays in generating or recognizing revenue  our operating results would be disproportionately affected 
you should not rely on our results for one quarter as any indication of our future performance 
we believe our results of operations may reflect some seasonality 
historically  our sales are lower in the first half of each fiscal year and higher in the second half of each fiscal year  which we believe may be partially due to construction cycles and budgetary cycles of our customers 
if our supplier relationships are disrupted or if costs or availability of our raw materials change  our operating results may suffer 
our business and its prospects are affected by the cost and availability of raw materials 
we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain of our raw materials  including optical fiber  aramid yarns  plastics and other raw materials 
we do not have long term agreements with all of these suppliers 
in fact  some of our suppliers of optical fiber are also major competitors in the market for fiber optic cable 
for example  we may buy some of our optical fiber from a supplier that also offers fiber optic cables that compete with our fiber optic cables 
these raw materials are critical to our production of fiber optic cables 
our business and its prospects  including our financial condition  future prospects  and results of operations  could be adversely affected by any disruption in our supply of raw materials or any increase in our costs resulting from our suppliers reducing the amount of optical fiber available to us  increasing their prices  lengthening the lead time for orders or otherwise impairing our ability to secure optical fiber  aramid yarns  plastics or other raw materials on competitive terms 
potential strategic alliances may not achieve their objectives 
we intend to explore strategic alliances designed to increase the use of our manufacturing capacity  to increase distribution of our products  to secure supplies of raw materials and to expand our product offerings 
we may not be successful in developing these strategic alliances 
moreover  alliances that optical cable corporation does develop may not achieve their strategic objectives  and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated 
if a disaster struck our primary business facility  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 
we believe that our success to date has been  and future results of operations will be  dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our customers 
as a result  any disruption of our day to day operations could cause a significant decline in our sales  negatively impact our financial performance and cause a decline in our share price 
our manufacturing operations  marketing  management information systems  customer service and distribution functions are housed in a single facility in roanoke  virginia 
a fire  flood  earthquake  terrorist attack  act of war  military conflict  or any other disaster affecting our facility could disable the functions performed at our roanoke  virginia facility 
any significant damage to this facility would have a material adverse effect on our business and its prospects  including our results of operations and financial condition 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties we own our principal administration  marketing  manufacturing  and product development facilities which are situated on approximately acres of land near the roanoke  virginia airport and major trucking company facilities 
our facilities are housed in an approximately  square foot building on this property 
we also lease a square foot sales office in fort wayne  indiana 
we believe that we are currently operating at approximately of our production equipment capacity 
additional personnel would

we can provide no assurance as to the time required to complete the process of hiring and training personnel or our ability to secure additional warehousing space  necessary to utilize our excess capacity
