item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including but not limited to those set forth in risk factors in item a of part i of this report and elsewhere in this report

overview general we are a full service residential real estate brokerage firm  using the internet  proprietary technology and efficient business processes to provide home buyers and sellers with high quality service and value 
our solution includes a client centric business approach  a sophisticated website that empowers home buyers and sellers with relevant information  a proprietary business management technology platform and significant financial savings for consumers 
we share a portion of our commissions with our buyer clients in the form of a cash rebate  and typically represent our seller clients at fee levels below those offered by most traditional brokerage companies in our markets 
generally  our seller clients pay a total brokerage fee of to of the transaction value  of which to is paid to agents representing buyers 
our net revenues are comprised primarily of commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we record revenues net of rebate or commission discount  if any  paid to our clients 
our net revenues are principally driven by the number of transactions we close and the average net revenue per transaction 
average net revenue per transaction is a function of the home sales price and percentage commission we receive on each transaction 
we also receive revenues from certain co marketing arrangements  such as our relationship with e loan  inc  which provides the mortgage center on our website and pays us a flat monthly fee that is established on a periodic basis 
generally  non commission revenues represent less than of our net revenues during any period 
we are currently exploring our options for offering other services related to the purchase  sale and ownership of a home 
we were founded in  currently have operations in major metropolitan areas  and as of december  employed  people  of whom  were zipagents 
we commenced operations in las vegas in april  houston in june  miami in october  tampa in february  orlando in april  minneapolis st 
paul in may  austin in july  palm beach in september  the greater philadelphia area in december and naples in march we have announced plans to enter tucson  denver  jacksonville  richmond and salt lake city in 
table of contents trends in our business our business has experienced significant growth since our inception in  primarily as a result of increased transaction volume and increased average net revenue per transaction 
in the year ended december   we generated million in net revenues  compared to million in and million in the number of closed transactions increased from approximately  in to approximately  in and increased to  in our average net revenue per transaction increased from approximately  in to approximately  in and decreased to approximately  in our transaction volume is primarily driven by the number of zipagents we employ  which increased to  at december  from  at december  and at december  our average net revenue per transaction decreased over this time primarily as a result of our growing percentage of transactions occurring in less expensive housing price markets outside of california 
as we add additional zipagents  we believe long term we will continue to increase our transaction volume and grow our business  although this may not be the case if the market continues to soften 
in addition  we believe that customer acquisition is one of our core competencies  and while we anticipate that the difficulty of acquiring a sufficient number of leads online may increase over time  we expect that we can mitigate some of that impact with repeat and referral business  as well as by increasing our visibility and credibility to potential clients over time 
since our market share has averaged less than over the past twelve months in our existing markets in aggregate  we believe that there is an opportunity to increase our market share  even if the overall level of sales decline due to changing consumer sentiment  interest rate increases or other economic or geopolitical factors 
since early september of we have experienced significant increases in the available inventories of homes for sale in many of our markets  as well as increases in the amount of time listings are taking to sell 
for example  average monthly inventories in our existing markets increased approximately in compared to  and months of inventory increased approximately in december compared to december pricing increases have also slowed  and some markets have shown declines in median selling prices over this period 
according to nar  national sales of existing homes fell to million in from million in in the state of california  the california association of realtors reported that sales of existing homes declined in compared to in our opinion  these data points suggest the housing market is in a period of transition  with more power shifting to buyers from sellers  and that the residential real estate market may continue to soften in the foreseeable future 
while over the long term we believe a more balanced market will be beneficial to our model  which relies primarily on representing buyers  during this period of transition we may continue to experience reduced growth rates and agent productivity versus our historical levels as buyers react cautiously to perceived changing market conditions 
over time  we have made significant adjustments to our cost structure and revenue model in order to improve the financial results of our business 
we have modified the compensation and expense reimbursement structure for zipagents over time  and we most recently changed our commission and or expense structure in february currently  our zipagents earn a compensation package consisting of a percentage of the commissions they generate for us that ranges from to of our net revenues after deducting certain other items 
we also provide our zipagents with health  retirement and other benefits  and pay for certain marketing costs and other business expenses 
zipagents may also be granted equity incentives based on performance 
we may make further modifications to our compensation structure in the future 
we have lowered our buyer rebate percentage several times to improve our revenue model 
in march  we reduced our buyer rebate to of our commission from of our commission  up to a maximum of of the home sales price 
the effect of the buyer rebate reduction was recognized over a phase in period of approximately two to four months as the reduction only affected new clients immediately while existing clients continued under the prior rebate policy for transactions already in progress and for transactions opened within a short period after the reduction was announced 
we implemented these buyer rebate percentage reductions for several reasons  including our determination that our growing reputation for superior service allowed us not to compete solely on price  our efforts to improve our revenue model and agent compensation model  and our desire to offer a simplified rebate structure to our clients 

table of contents we achieved profitability for the first time in the third quarter of and maintained profitability for the fourth quarter as well  primarily as a result of increased transaction volume  higher average net revenue per transaction and improved management of discretionary expenses 
however  as a result of the seasonality to which our business is subject  we again experienced a net loss in the first quarter of we returned to profitability in the second  third and fourth quarters of  primarily as a result of higher average net transaction revenue and increased transactional volume due to our increased zipagent force and seasonal factors 
we achieved profitability in the first quarter of  the first time in our seasonally slow first quarter  primarily as a result of higher average net transaction revenues and increased transactional volume due to our increased zipagent force 
while we experienced a net loss in the second quarter of as a result of a one time charge relating to the settlement of a threatened class action lawsuit  we would have been profitable excluding the effect of this settlement 
we again achieved profitability in the third and fourth quarters of  but because of seasonality and new market expansion as well as the current softening in the residential real estate market  we experienced a net loss in the first and second quarters of we achieved profitability in the third quarter of  but experienced a net loss in the fourth quarter of as a result of decreased transaction volume due to our seasonally slow fourth quarter and continued market softness 
over the past several years there has been a decline in average commissions charged in the real estate brokerage industry  in part due to companies such as ours exerting downward pressure on prices with a lower commission structure  as well as by what  in our view  appears to be an increase in consumer willingness to negotiate fees with their agents 
we believe that many consumers are focusing on absolute commission dollars paid to sell their home as opposed to accepting a traditional standard market commission percentage 
according to real trends  while the average commission percentage decreased from in to in  total commission revenues increased from billion to billion during that same period  influenced by steadily increasing sales volumes and higher median sales prices 
in the event that commissions continue to decline  we have designed our business model around an attractive cost structure and operational efficiencies which we believe should allow us to continue to offer our services at prices less than those charged by the majority of our competitors 
in addition  the competitive landscape in the residential real estate industry is in the midst of significant changes as new business models enter the marketplace 
for example  redfin corporation has introduced a discount brokerage model currently in two states that allows clients to make offers to purchase homes and to list homes for sale directly online  while receiving a two thirds rebate of their commission 
buyside realty  another discount brokerage  employs agents who are paid salaries and bonuses based on customer service  not commissions  while offering a rebate of their commission 
realestate 
com  which is owned by lendingtree  llc  acts as a lead generator for real estate brokers and agents  and has recently opened a direct to consumer brokerage service 
trulia  inc operates a residential real estate search engine to connect consumers directly to listings on agent and broker web sites 
in order to continue growing  our business model must remain attractive to consumers so that we can compete successfully with these newer models as they expand into our marketplaces 
in addition  to remain economically viable  we will need to be able to compete effectively with these new entrants for the acquisition of agents and leads 
market seasonality  cyclicality and interest rate influences the residential real estate brokerage market is influenced both by annual seasonality factors  as well as by overall economic cycles 
while individual markets vary  transaction volume activity nationally tends to progressively increase from january through the summer months  then gradually slows over the last three to four months of the calendar year 
revenues in each quarter are significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter  given the typical to day time lag between contract execution and closing 
while we believe that  until fairly recently  seasonality has been somewhat masked by our overall growth  we have been  and believe we will continue to be  influenced by overall market activity and seasonal forces 
we generally experience the most significant impact in the first and fourth quarters of each year  when our revenues are typically lower relative to the second and third quarters as a result of traditionally slower home sales activity and reduced listings inventory between thanksgiving and presidents day 
we believe that the overall macroeconomic environment and periodic business cycles can influence the general health of the residential real estate market at any given point in time 
generally  when economic times are 
table of contents fair or good  the housing market tends to perform well 
if the economy is weak  interest rates dramatically increase  or there are market events such as terrorist attacks or threats  the outbreak of war or geopolitical uncertainties  the housing market could be negatively impacted 
over the past several decades  the national residential real estate market has demonstrated significant growth  with annual existing home sales volume growing from million in to approximately million in and median existing home sales prices increasing every year during that period 
during that period  the volume of existing home sales has declined for at least two consecutive years only twice  namely through and through the declines in sales volumes in the through period occurred while interest rates were at historic highs  with long term us treasury rates exceeding 
with rates remaining at similarly high levels  housing activity expanded during the period from through average interest rates were lower during the second period of consecutive year declines  through  than in many factors influence an individual s decision to buy or sell a home  and we believe that no one factor alone determines the health of the residential real estate market 
for example  a rise in interest rates could lead to lower demand for housing or put downward pressure on prices because  all else being equal  it should increase monthly housing payments or reduce the amount an individual can pay for a home 
however  it is also our experience that lifestyle influences  such as job relocation  changes in family dynamics or a desire to change neighborhoods  significantly impact the demand for residential real estate 
in addition  periods of interest rate increases are often characterized by improving economic fundamentals  which can create jobs  increase incomes and bolster consumer confidence  all of which are factors that positively influence housing demand 
it is difficult to predict which influences will be strongest  and ultimately whether the housing market will be affected positively or negatively when faced with numerous influences 
while it is difficult to isolate the cause of recent transaction volume declines and pricing growth slowing in the residential real estate market  such softening has been occurring since fall of as interest rates have been increasing 
other factors have likely contributed to the slowdown as well  such as high fuel prices  persistent press coverage about residential real estate potentially being poised for a correction  and the fact that prices had until that time been increasing at historically high rates 
this rapid price appreciation  which was well ahead of household income growth  along with increasing interest rates has made housing less affordable  which has manifested itself in declining home ownership rates  which peaked in with overall transaction activity declining and sales price increases slowing  overall commissions generated in the industry could decline as well  potentially causing the roughly billion in annual commissions generated in to decline 
however  should the addressable market for our services decline somewhat due to decreasing sales volume or prices  we believe the overall size of the market on an absolute basis will remain very large  providing ample addressable opportunity for us to continue to grow our business through increasing our market share 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  and of those policies  we believe that the following accounting policies involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
we derive the substantial majority of our revenues from commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we recognize commission revenues upon closing of a sale and purchase transaction  net of any rebate or commission discount  or transaction fee adjustment  as evidenced by the closure of the escrow or similar account and the transfer of these funds to all appropriate parties 
we recognize non commission revenues from our other business relationships  such as our e loan marketing relationship  as the fees are earned from the other party typically on a monthly fee basis 
revenues are recognized when there is persuasive 
table of contents evidence of an arrangement  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and the transaction has been completed

stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas revised  share based payment sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases  based on estimated fair values

under the fair value recognition provisions for sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense using the straight line method over the requisite service period of the award 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas r except for options granted prior to our filing of the registration statement for an initial public offering in may  for which the fair value was determined for disclosure purposes using the minimum value method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation cost recognized in the year ended december  includes compensation cost for all unvested stock based awards as of january  that were granted subsequent to our filing of the registration statement for an initial public offering in may  and prior to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  compensation cost for stock based awards granted subsequent  to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  and compensation cost for options granted prior to our filing of the registration statement for an initial public offering in may  based on the intrinsic value method

because there 
table of contents was no public market for our stock prior to our initial public offering in november  our board of directors determined the fair value of our common and preferred stock based on several factors  including  but not limited to  our operating and financial performance  recent sales of convertible debt instruments and internal valuation analyses considering key terms and rights of the related instruments 
for options granted after our initial public offering  the fair value of our common stock is the closing price of our stock on the nasdaq global market on the date the option was granted 
for options which were granted prior to our initial public offering  the deemed fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors  with input from management  utilizing the market approach  considering a number of factors  including  but not limited to comparable values of similar companies and the pricing of recent rounds of financing  revenue growth and profitability milestones achieved and as measured to budget  continued growth in experience of our management team  marketplace activity and competition  barriers to entry  and status of capital markets 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under current tax law 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable  respectively  for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
historically  we have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  the majority of which relate to net operating loss tax carryforwards generated before we achieved profitability 
during the fourth quarter  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefit of a significant portion of these deferred tax assets in the future 
consequently  we recognized a net tax benefit of million resulting primarily from the release of a significant portion of the net deferred tax valuation allowance 
during the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that a full valuation allowance should be reinstated against its net deferred tax assets at december  as available evidence  including recent historical results and management s expectations for the future  supported a more likely than not conclusion that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as a result  the tax expense for the year ended december  includes a non cash expense of million related to the recording of a full valuation allowance 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to offset future taxable income 
if not utilized  the federal and state net operating losses will begin to expire in for federal and for state tax purposes  respectively 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership 
we have federal and state net operating losses of approximately million at december  that are subject to annual limitations of  the difference between our effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate is primarily a function of the release of the valuation allowance provided against the net deferred tax assets and permanent differences 
our future effective income tax rate will depend on various factors  such as changes in our valuation allowance  pending or future tax law changes including rate changes and the tax benefit from research and development credits  potential limitations on the use of federal and state net operating losses  and state taxes

consequently  we recognized a net tax benefit of million resulting primarily from the release of a significant portion of the net deferred tax valuation allowance 
we recorded a provision for income taxes in attributable to federal and state alternative minimum taxes currently payable due to limits on the amount of net operating losses that may be applied against income earned in under current tax regulations 
at december   we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on the determination that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering in november  we funded our operations primarily through the sale of preferred stock and convertible notes  which provided us with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in november we completed our initial public offering  which raised net proceeds  after underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses  of approximately million 
as of december  and  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and million  respectively 
we had no bank debt  line of credit or equipment facilities at december  and operating activities our operating activities generated cash in the amount of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively

cash generated in the years ended december  and was primarily due to growth in our business and  in the accrual of million for litigation settlement 
our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of our commission income from escrow companies or similar intermediaries in the real estate transaction closing process 
due to the structure of our commission arrangements  our accounts receivable are converted to cash on a short term basis and our accounts receivable balances at period end have historically been significantly less than one month s net revenues 
our operating cash flows will be impacted in the future by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable  which are generally paid within the invoice terms and conditions 
our cash outflows are also impacted by the timing of the payment of our accrued liabilities relating to commissions and related compensation costs and client acquisition costs 
a number of non cash items have been charged to expense and decreased our net income or increased our net loss 
these items include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and non cash employee stock based compensation expense and other stock based charges 
to the extent these non cash items increase or decrease in amount and increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows

currently  we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million 
capital expenditures for are expected to include approximately million to increase server capacity and purchase of computer equipment and software 
in the future  our ability to make significant capital investments may depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to obtain adequate financing  if necessary and available 
financing activities our financing activities provided cash in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sources of cash from financing activities in both and primarily represented the proceeds from stock option exercises 
in  sources of cash primarily represented proceeds from preferred stock warrant and stock option exercises as well as our initial public offering in november as of december   we had warrants outstanding for the purchase of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
all of these warrants are currently exercisable at the option of the holders 
if all or a portion of these warrants were exercised for cash  we could receive significant proceeds at that time 
future needs we believe that cash flows from operations and our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of growth into new geographic markets  our level of investment in technology and advertising initiatives 
we are currently exploring several options for offering services relating to the purchase  sale and ownership of a home  including services related to title insurance  escrow  mortgage  home warranty insurance and property and casualty insurance including auto insurance  which we refer to as core services 
we expect that some of our core services will be offered through affiliates including wholly owned subsidiaries  while others will be offered through joint ventures or marketing arrangements with independent third parties  such as title companies  banks and insurance companies 
we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we currently have no bank debt or line of credit facilities 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired  our business  operations and results will likely suffer
