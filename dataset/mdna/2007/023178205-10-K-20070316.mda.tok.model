the lines of business that we reinsure include commercial auto liability  commercial physical damage and workers compensation 
these risks are associated with members of highly selective affinity groups or associations 
prior to entering into reinsurance arrangements  
table of contents we require the members  whose risk is reinsured under a program  to meet certain loss control program qualifications and pass certain pre qualification criteria as part of the underwriting review by a third party 
our reinsurance transactions are made through quota share agreements in which we agree to accept a certain fixed percentage of premiums written from the ceding company the original insurance carrier and in general assume the same percentage of purchased reinsurance  direct acquisition costs and ultimate incurred claims 
we purchase excess of loss and aggregate stop loss reinsurance to mitigate potential losses from a severe adverse loss development 
we typically retain the first layer of risk on a per policy basis  which ranges from  to  and a third party reinsurance company through excess of loss reinsurance retains the next layer up to the policy limits of million 
above million  we retain losses up to the aggregate reinsurance limit  which varies with each quota share agreement  and the third party reinsurance company pays losses in excess of our aggregate reinsurance limit up to million 
we are responsible for any additional losses in excess of the aggregate reinsurance limit

business strategy our strategy for our cruise segment is to become a leader in the luxury small ship cruise segment 
a key part of our business strategy is making cruise acquisitions that we believe are complementary to our cruise business 
we believe that by acquiring or developing strong brands in the luxury  small ship category we can become a global provider of vacation experiences to unique and desirable destinations 
we intend to continue evaluating and considering acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our cruise operations 

table of contents our strategy for our marine segment will principally focus on the operations of bellingham marine and the expansion of this brand into new worldwide markets and the expansion of its product offerings 
as part of our business strategy relating to the operations of bellingham marine  we intend to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of technologies  products and businesses that we believe are complementary to our bellingham marine operations 
our strategy for bellport is to leverage our hospitality disciplines  modernize our customers management systems  strengthen our customers financial controls and maintain focused marketing abilities to position this segment to grow and expand its reach in the marine and yachting marketplace 
we believe that bellingham marine will be the dominant driver in our marine growth 
our strategy for our travel and events segment is to maintain our quality standards while increasing our overall volume of business by differentiating ourselves from our competitors and extending the array of services offered  including event management technology and software 
in addition  we see an opportunity to develop and own internally developed events for specific causes and industries 
we continue to pursue selective acquisitions of businesses in the cruise  marine  travel  events  leisure  hospitality and service sectors that will increase stockholder value 
see recent developments 
competition the cruise industry is a highly competitive marketplace with several operators providing cruise offerings domestically and internationally 
we compete in terms of price  itineraries  services and ship types 
in addition  cruising is one of several options that people have when selecting a vacation 
we face competition from other vacation operators which provide leisure and vacation alternatives including resorts  hotels and packaged tours 
we believe that we provide a unique experience that is appealing to our target market  but other alternatives may become more appealing 
there can be no assurance that our present or future competitors will not exert significant competitive pressures on us 
the marine industry is a competitive marketplace 
we compete with other marina builders  service providers and general contractors in terms of quality  price  product and timing 
we believe that we deliver a superior product to our competition  and have created a development team  facilities and process that allows us to exceed our clients expectations 
we believe that our brands are well known for quality within the industry 
there can be no assurance that our present or future competitors will not exert significant competitive pressures on us 
the travel and event industry is highly competitive 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than us 
we believe that  although some potential clients will focus on price alone  other clients will also be interested in the quality of the programs developed and the excellence of the customer service provided 
we believe that we provide a level of service that exceeds our competition 
we compete with respect to price and service  and believe our technology is a key element of our service 
we believe the barriers to entry are relatively low for any future competitors within the travel and event segment of our business due to the limited resources required 
additionally  certain organizations engaged in the travel and event industry have substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that our present or future competitors will not exert significant competitive pressures on us 
regulatory the federal maritime commission regulates passenger ships with or more passenger berths departing from us ports and requires that operators post security to be used in the event the operator fails to provide cruise services  or otherwise satisfy certain financial standards 
we have secured a million surety bond as security under the federal maritime commission 
as a result of the rules and regulations relating to the operation of passenger ships in the us  we believe our us flagged designation provides us with significant itinerary advantages 
these regulations permit only 
table of contents us ships that are us built  owned by us citizens  operated by us crews and officers and us flagged by the us coast guard to operate exclusively among us ports 
us flagged ships may not travel the us waterways without also visiting a foreign port during the same voyage 
in contrast  our cruise ships can travel through america s heartland without having to include a foreign port 
we believe this gives us a distinct advantage in our alaska operations allowing us to offer juneau to juneau roundtrip itineraries without the need to sail additional days to canadian ports 
on our inland us waterway itineraries  including mississippi  ohio  columbia and snake rivers sailings  federal laws and regulations effectively prohibit foreign flagged ships from operating on the us waterways and thus limit competing itineraries 
in december  we formed cypress re and registered it as a class reinsurer pursuant to section of the bermuda monetary authority act to carry on business in that capacity subject to the provisions of the bermuda monetary authority act 
under bermuda regulations  cypress re is required to maintain a surplus of of gross written premiums or of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  whichever is greater 
as of december   cypress re has million of contributed capital from us which is in excess of the required statutory capital and surplus of million 
insurance we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is adequate for our businesses  including but not limited to coverage for professional and general liability 
we also maintain insurance coverage on our ships  real property and personal property  and as required on leased properties 
we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that the insurance maintained by us will be adequate in the event of a claim  or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future or at reasonable prices 
we carry marine liability insurance on our ships through various mutual protection and indemnity associations 
our marine liability insurance arrangements are typical of common marine industry practices and  subject to certain deductibles  provide coverage for losses  other than hull physical damage losses  including casualty damage by the ships and claims by crew members  passengers and other third parties 
as a member of mutual protection and indemnity associations  we pay our annual premiums based largely on our risk characteristics and loss experience  and the loss experience of other members 
in addition  because such associations and other maritime mutual indemnity associations around the world pool a portion of their loss experience in risk sharing arrangements  these associations also may be affected by the loss experience of other mutual protection and indemnity organizations 
over and above this pooling arrangement  these associations have additional independent reinsurance protection 
our annual protection and indemnity insurance premium consists of annual mutual premiums 
we may be liable for supplemental premiums in excess of the anticipated amount in the event that an association incurs heavy losses or experiences unusual circumstances 
we also carry a multi line marine and non marine package policy which is underwritten by various insurers 
this package policy provides hull and machinery coverage which insures against physical loss and damage to the ships  subject to various deductibles 
the ships are insured for their appraised value 
although we believe the risk of a total loss of our ships is remote  in all likelihood the replacement costs would exceed these coverage limits 
additionally  this package policy provides coverage against loss of revenue and extra expenses incurred in connection with a marine casualty or other covered interruption in service  subject to various deductibles 
we believe our insurance coverage is adequate based on our assessment of the risks to be insured  the probabilities of loss and the relative cost of available coverages 

table of contents environment we are subject to federal  state and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations in each country where we have a business presence 
although we continue to make capital expenditures for environmental protection  we do not anticipate any significant expenditures in order to comply with such laws and regulations that would have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position 
we are not aware of any pending litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
we cannot assure you  however  that environmental problems relating to properties owned or operated by us will not develop in the future  and we cannot predict whether any such problems  if they were to develop  could require significant expenditures on our part 
in addition  we are unable to predict what legislation or regulations may be adopted or enacted in the future with respect to environmental protection and waste disposal 
employees on december   we employed employees 
our employees are primarily located in the states of california  florida  georgia  illinois  missouri  oregon  pennsylvania  washington  the countries of australia  england  mexico  new zealand  france and spain  and various other individual offices throughout the united states and the world 
we have full time employees engaged in management  construction  marketing and sales  operations  administration and finance 
we also employ temporary labor on a periodic basis to assist with our operations due to the seasonal nature of our cruise and travel and events businesses 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or are represented by a union 
we believe that our labor relations are good 
once we consummate our acquisition of windstar cruises  we anticipate that a number of our international crews in this operation will be members of certain international unions established by their countries of origin 
seasonality our businesses are seasonal 
historically  the majority of our operating results were recognized in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year 
as a result of the acquisitions within our cruise segment and the size of our cruise operations in relation to our overall operations  we expect that the majority of our operating results will be recognized in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year  which coincides with the cruising season within this new segment 
our future annual results could be adversely affected if our revenue were to be substantially below seasonal norms during the second and third quarters of the year

risk factors you should consider carefully the specific risk factors set forth below and other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  as these are important factors  among others  that could cause our actual results to differ from our expected or historical results 
you should note that the risks described below are not the only risks that we face 
the risks listed below are only those risks relating to our operations that we consider to be material 
there may be additional risks  that we currently consider not to be material  or which we are not currently aware of  that could have an adverse effect on our future results 

table of contents risks related to our company and our industry our success depends on our ability to manage our growth 
we recently experienced a period of rapid growth from acquisitions 
this growth has placed significant demands on our human and financial resources 
we must continue to improve our operational  financial and management information controls and systems and effectively motivate  train and manage our employees to properly manage this growth 
even if these steps are taken  we cannot be sure that our recent acquisitions will be integrated successfully into our business operations 
our future performance is dependent on management s ability to manage our growth effectively 
if we are not able to successfully integrate our acquisitions  we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create 
the process of expanding our fleet of ships may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require management attention that would otherwise be available for the operation of our existing ships 
in addition  if we do not manage this growth effectively  maintain the quality of our businesses despite the demands on our resources and retain key personnel  our business could be harmed 
prior to our acquisition of cruise related assets and businesses in and our acquisition of bellingham marine in  we had no experience in operating a cruise business or marina construction business 
our recent cruise and marina construction acquisitions expose us to new risks associated with entering new lines of business that we have limited or no experience operating 
we anticipate that there may be many things we will need to learn and master to be successful in these new endeavors 
moreover  we have a limited operating history within our cruise and marine segments  which may make it difficult to predict our long term success 
failure to successfully manage the risks associated with the development and implementation of new lines of business could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our recent growth has been driven by acquisitions 
we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates in the future 
our recent growth is attributable to the acquisition of american west  the cruise related assets of delta queen and bellingham marine 
in the future  a significant element of our business strategy will be to acquire assets or businesses that are complementary to our businesses 
we compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies  many of which have greater name recognition  marketing support and financial resources than we have  which may result in a diminished number of acquisition opportunities available to us and higher acquisition prices 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify  pursue or acquire any targeted businesses or make any acquisitions on terms favorable to us 
if we fail to identify and complete acquisitions in the future  our growth and financial performance will be adversely affected 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the companies and businesses that we acquire  including our acquisitions of american west  the cruise related assets of delta queen  windstar cruises and bellingham marine 
as part of our business strategy  we regularly consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of assets and businesses that we believe are complementary to our business 
acquisitions typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in integrating the operations  personnel  and assets of the companies acquired  some of which may result in significant charges to earnings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate any acquired businesses without substantial costs  delays and or other operational or financial problems 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks in addition to those described above 
these risks include the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  
table of contents the potential loss of key employees  potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  the ability of management to effectively and efficiently manage the new operations we acquire  and adverse effects on our reported operating results due to acquisition costs and expenses associated with integrating and assimilating the operations of the acquired businesses 
if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing businesses  we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create  which may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows and the market price of our stock 
in addition  a substantial portion of our available cash could be used in order to consummate potential acquisitions of businesses 
we may also seek to finance such acquisitions through debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that such financings will be available at all or on terms acceptable to us 
if the consideration for an acquisition includes equity securities  our stockholders could experience dilution 
in connection with our acquisitions within the cruise segment  we assumed or incurred a significant amount of indebtedness  which could adversely affect our cash flows and business 
in connection with our recent acquisitions of american west and the cruise related assets of delta queen  we assumed a significant amount of indebtedness in amounts that have greatly exceeded our historical levels of indebtedness 
we assumed approximately million in fixed rate  debt payable through in connection with our acquisition of american west 
we also assumed approximately million of fixed rate  debt payable through as a result of our acquisition of the cruise related assets of delta queen 
we also anticipate an additional million in seller financing from our acquisition of windstar cruises  payable at through as a result of this debt  demands on our cash resources will increase in the future 
the increased levels of debt could  among other things require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  dividends  acquisitions and other purposes  increase our vulnerability to  and limit flexibility in planning for  adverse economic and industry conditions  adversely affect our credit rating  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  additional acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with less indebtedness  and limit our ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the repayment of debt 
if we are unable to manage our financial resources during our expansion  our financial performance may be adversely affected 
our plans for growth and expansion will require significant capital expenditures that may not produce corresponding revenues in the near term  which may place a strain on our capital resources 
the process of expanding our fleet of ships may require additional financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing operation of our existing fleet of ships 
our failure to manage our financial resources effectively during our expansion could force us to delay or abandon some of our expansion plans and may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our financial performance is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations 
our businesses are seasonal 
we recognize cruise related revenues at the completion of the cruise 
we recognize revenue for marine and related services in accordance with the respective contracts 
we recognize travel  incentive and event related revenues in the month a program operates 
insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of the insurance contracts in proportion to the amount of the insurance coverage provided 
historically  the majority of our operating results were recognized in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year 
as a result of the acquisitions within our cruise segment and the size of our cruise operations in relation to our overall operations  we expect that the majority of our operating results will be recognized in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year  which coincides with the cruising season 
our future annual results could be adversely affected if our revenue were to be substantially below seasonal norms during the second and third quarters of each fiscal year 
our operating results may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including our ability to effectively and efficiently operate our cruise operations  customer cancellation rates  competitive conditions in the industries in which we operate  marketing expenses  extreme weather conditions  timing of and costs related to acquisitions  the impact of new laws and regulations affecting our business  negative incidents involving cruise ships  including those involving the health and safety of passengers  cruise ship maintenance problems  reduced consumer demand for vacations and cruise vacations  changes in fuel  food  payroll  insurance and security costs  the availability of raw materials  our ability to enter into profitable marina construction contracts  changes in relationships with certain travel providers  changes in vacation industry capacity  the mix of programs and events  program destinations and event locations  the introduction and acceptance of new programs and program and event enhancements by us and our competitors  other economic factors and other considerations affecting the travel industry  potential claims related to our reinsurance business  and the potentially volatile nature of the reinsurance business 
as a result of these and other factors  our operations and financial condition could suffer  which could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to effectively compete against our competitors  our financial conditions will suffer 
the cruise  marine and travel industries are highly competitive 
we compete with other companies that provide similar products and services 
we believe the barriers to entry within some of the industries in which we operate are relatively low 
certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources than we do 
as a result  there can be no assurance that our present competitors or competitors that elect to enter the marketplace in the future will not exert significant competitive pressures on us 
these competitive factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by events adversely affecting the travel industry  including the affects of general economic conditions 
a substantial portion of our operations are directly associated with the travel industry 
demand for travel and vacations is dependent on the underlying strength of the economy 
as a result  our operations are subject to 
table of contents special risks inherent in doing business in that industry 
adverse changes in the economic climate  such as higher fuel prices  higher interest rates and changes in governmental policies could reduce the discretionary income of our potential cruise passengers or companies scheduling conventions  trade shows or meetings 
consequently  this could negatively affect demand for vacations  including cruise vacations  and for travel  events or conventions  all of which are discretionary purchases 
in addition  the travel industry is highly susceptible to unforeseen events  such as wars  acts of terrorism  civil disturbances  political instability  governmental activities and deprivation of contract rights 
demand for our products and services may also be adversely affected by natural occurrences such as hurricanes  earthquakes  epidemics and flooding in regions in which we offer our products and provide our services 
periods of instability or uncertainty surrounding the travel industry may reduce the demand for our programs and services and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market 
as a result of our cruise acquisitions  we operate in the vacation market  and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation 
we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines  but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options  including hotels  resorts and package holidays and tours 
we face significant competition from other cruise lines  both on the basis of cruise pricing and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to cruise passengers 
in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our success is highly dependent upon unaffiliated travel services suppliers 
in order to provide our services and products  we are dependent on airlines  hotels and other suppliers of travel and processing services 
we have limited agreements with our travel suppliers and vendors that obligate such suppliers or vendors to process or sell services or products through us 
we rely to a large extent on scheduled commercial airline services to get our customers to our cruise ships and  therefore  increases in the price of  or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service  could undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages 
restricted access to suppliers and vendors of travel services and processing  or a reduction in capacity or changes in pricing or collateral arrangements with travel suppliers or vendors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
overcapacity within the cruise vacation industry  a reduction in demand or economic uncertainties could have a negative impact on revenues  result in impairment of assets and may adversely affect profitability 
cruising capacity has grown in recent years and we expect it to increase further as cruise vacation companies introduce new ships 
demand for cruises has been and is expected to continue to be dependent on economic conditions 
economic changes may reduce demand for cruise vacations and may lead to reduced occupancy and or price discounting which  in turn  could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could result in impairment of our asset values 
our business could be adversely affected by unanticipated casualty losses 
due to the nature of our businesses  we may be subject to liability claims arising out of accidents or disasters causing injury to our customers  including claims for serious personal injury or death 
although we have never experienced a liability loss for which we did not have adequate insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more large claims or that the insurance carrier will be solvent at the time of any covered loss 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at acceptable premium levels in the future 
successful assertion against us of one or a series of large uninsured claims  or of one or a series of claims exceeding our insurance  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents no assurance can be given that our insurance costs will not escalate 
our protection and indemnity insurance  or p i  is provided by various mutual protection and indemnity associations 
as associations  they rely on member premiums  investment reserves and income  and reinsurance to manage liability risks on behalf of their members 
increased investment losses  underwriting losses or reinsurance costs could cause domestic or international marine insurance associations to substantially raise the cost of premiums  resulting not only in higher premium costs  but also higher levels of deductibles 
increases in our premiums or deductible levels could adversely impact our operating costs 
we are dependent upon key personnel 
our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and certain other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not have any long term employment agreements with our executive officers  other than with our chairman and ceo 
our future success also depends on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled managerial  operational  marketing and customer service personnel 
the failure to retain and attract necessary managerial  operational  marketing and customer service personnel could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
international political and other world events affecting safety and security could adversely affect the demand for cruises and could harm our future sales and profitability 
demand for cruises and other vacation options has been  and is expected to continue to be  affected by the public s attitude towards the safety and security of travel 
events such as the terrorist attacks in the us on september  and the threats of additional attacks in the us and elsewhere  concerns of an outbreak of additional hostilities and national government travel advisories  together with the resulting political instability and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling  have had a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry and may continue to do so in the future 
decreases in demand could lead to price discounting which  in turn  could reduce the profitability of our business 
incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather conditions could adversely affect our reputation and harm our future sales and profitability 
the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents  including those caused by the improper operation of our ships  passenger and crew illnesses such as the spread of contagious diseases  mechanical failures  fires  collisions  inappropriate crew or passenger behavior  weather events  security breaches and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety  health  security and vacation satisfaction and thereby adversely affect future industry performance and expose us to claims by those that may be harmed 
for example  our empress of the north ran aground in march during a cruise which required us to cancel three cruises  and we experienced an outbreak of norovirus on our mississippi queen in october which required us to cancel three cruises 
it is possible that we could be forced to alter itineraries or cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these or other factors  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
incidents involving cruise ships  adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry  events such as terrorist attacks  war and other hostilities  or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters  such as storms and earthquakes  could impact demand and consequently have an adverse impact on our profitability 
ship mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises and unscheduled drydocks and repairs 
our cruise ships have from time to time experienced mechanical problems or extended or extraordinary maintenance and there can be no assurance that they will not experience such problems in the future 
mechanical faults or extended maintenance may result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs 
for example  our queen of the west experienced an engine failure in september  
table of contents causing us to cancel one cruise 
these events together with any related adverse publicity could affect our financial results 
unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our profits 
we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation 
the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  existing capacity constraints  security concerns  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  financial limitations on port development  local government regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities 
any limitations on the availability of our ports of call could adversely affect our profits 
the nature of our engineering and construction business exposes us to potential liability claims and contract disputes which may reduce our profits 
we engage in construction activities for marina facilities where design  construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties 
we and or our subsidiaries have been and may in the future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters 
these claims generally arise in the normal course of our business 
when it is determined that we have liability  we may not be covered by insurance or  if covered  the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
in addition  even where insurance is maintained for such exposures  the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims 
any liability not covered by our insurance  in excess of our insurance limits or  if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible  could result in a significant loss for us  which claims may reduce our profits and cash available for operations 
supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 
our ability to conduct and expand our marina construction operations is dependent on access to construction materials and skilled labor 
increased costs or shortages of materials such as cement  aluminum and wood could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays 
labor disputes or increased costs or shortages of skilled labor could also cause increases in costs and delays 
these prices and supplies may be further adversely affected by natural disasters and adverse weather conditions 
we estimate and forecast such costs as part of our business  and attempt to plan for possible cost increases due to changes in the cost or availability of materials or labor 
however  generally we are unable to pass on unanticipated increases in construction costs to those customers who have already entered into sales contracts  as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the project at the time the contract is signed  which may be well in advance of the construction work 
significant unexpected increases in costs of materials or labor may adversely affect our results of operations 
the demand  timing and funding of marina construction awards and other factors could lead to unpredictable operating results 
our marina construction operations are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing demand for marina construction projects  the timing and funding of new projects  the length of time over which construction contracts are to be performed  the ability to meet performance schedules  cost overruns and cancellations or changes in the scope of existing contracts 
as a result of these uncertainties  the operating results related to our marine business could be unpredictable and inconsistent from period to period 
we may incur increased costs related to repairing defects in marinas we design and construct 
our marina construction operations are subject to warranty and other claims related to design and construction defects and related issues  including compliance with construction codes 
the costs we incur to resolve those 
table of contents warranties and other claims could reduce our profitability  and if we were to experience an unusually high level of claims  or unusually severe claims  our profitability could be adversely affected 
an inability to obtain bonding could limit the number of projects we are able to pursue 
as is customary in the marina construction industry  we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance under construction contracts  development agreements and other arrangements 
our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and certain external factors  including the overall capacity of the surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
since  the surety industry has undergone significant changes with several companies withdrawing completely from the industry or significantly reducing their bonding commitment 
in addition  certain reinsurers of surety risk have limited their participation in this market 
therefore  we could be unable to obtain surety bonds  when required  which could adversely affect our future results of operations and revenues 
natural disasters  severe weather conditions and forces in nature beyond our control could impact our marina construction and management operations 
our marina construction and management operations are conducted in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather  such as hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes  floods  tsunamis and fires 
we also may be affected by unforeseen engineering  environmental  or geological problems 
these conditions could delay or increase the cost of construction projects  damage or reduce the availability of materials  and negatively impact the demand for marinas in affected areas 
if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events  our earnings  liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected 
our use of the percentage of completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenues or profits 
under our accounting procedures  we measure and recognize our marina construction profits and revenues under the percentage of completion accounting methodology 
this methodology allows us to recognize revenues and profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the costs incurred to date against the total amount of costs expected to be incurred 
the effect of revisions to revenues and estimated costs is recorded when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated  and these revisions can occur at any time and could be material 
given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts  it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made  which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits 
unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions  increased costs and potential losses 
our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and to changing domestic and international economic and political conditions which are beyond our control 
in our marine operations we currently operate in australia  spain  new zealand  france  united kingdom  mexico  canada  bahamas  malaysia and china 
with the addition of windstar cruises  we will offer itineraries with destinations to costa rica  greece  spain  portugal  turkey  italy  france  british virgin islands  barbados  french west indies  grenada and other foreign ports of call 
we anticipate that our foreign destinations will change and expand over time 
operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations  embargoes  trade restrictions  tax increases  
table of contents united states government policies  and international hostilities 
we also face significant risks due to civil strife  acts of war  terrorism and insurrection 
our level of exposure to these risks will vary with respect to each project  depending on the particular stage of each such project 
for example  our risk exposure with respect to a marina construction project in an early development stage will generally be less than our risk exposure with respect to a project in the middle of construction 
to the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions  we may experience project disruptions and losses 
project disruptions and losses could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could increase our us dollar costs or reduce our us dollar revenues 
our international contracts are typically denominated in foreign currencies  which results in our foreign operations facing the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our us dollar costs for  or reduce our us dollar revenues from  our foreign operations 
any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits 
if we do not complete drydocking on schedule or within budget  or if any of our ships require unscheduled repairs  our revenues may be adversely impacted 
operation of our ships is subject to regulations established by the us department of transportation that are enforced by the us coast guard and other international class societies 
among these regulations is the requirement that the ships be taken out of operation and removed from the water for inspection of the exterior of the hull on a periodic basis  referred to as drydocking 
when we drydock one of our ships as required  we lose the revenue from that ship s operations for the period it is out of service 
we also incur the additional cost of the drydocking 
our ships must be drydocked every months  dependent upon the ship type 
we typically drydock our domestic ships in the winter months when they are typically out of operation due to limited demand 
we anticipate drydocking our international ships at preplanned times of low demand 
in years that we are not required to drydock our ships  we may remove each of them from service to perform routine repairs and maintenance and capital projects 
we refer to the period that each ship is removed from service as a lay up 
we cannot assure that future drydocks or lay ups for any of our ships will be completed on schedule or within their budgets 
unscheduled repairs could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations and our financial condition 
we may face significant costs to maintain our ships as they age 
we believe that the costs to maintain our fleet of ships will increase over time 
excluding the windstar cruises ships and our delta queen ship which is years old  the average age of our ships is approximately years 
we expect to incur increasing expenses to operate and maintain our ships in good condition as they age 
eventually  these ships will need to be replaced 
we may not be able to replace these ships with new ships based on uncertainties related to financing  timing and shipyard availability 
we may be unable to extend our ability to operate the delta queen beyond november  since  congress has granted the delta queen eight consecutive exemptions from the safety at sea act requirement because of fire prevention and safety enhancements made to the ship and the historic status of the delta queen 
the statute exempting the delta queen requires us to notify potential passengers that the delta queen does not comply with applicable fire standards and prohibits us from disclaiming liability for loss due to fire caused by our negligence 
the current exemption has been extended to november  our ability to 
table of contents operate the delta queen is dependent upon retaining our current congressional exemption and obtaining additional exemptions subsequent to if we experience delays and or defaults in customer payments  we could suffer liquidity problems or we could be unable to recover all expenditures 
because of the nature of our marina construction contracts  at times we commit resources to marina projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on client projects as they are incurred 
delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment 
if a customer defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources  it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 
our business could be adversely affected by losses associated with our reinsurance operations 
we currently reinsure property and casualty risks written by licensed us insurers 
the lines of business that are being reinsured include commercial auto liability  commercial physical damage and workers compensation 
if a loss event occurs and we are required by our agreements to cover such losses  the amount of our cash and cash equivalents will be reduced  and our results of operations and financial condition would suffer 
environmental  health and safety  financial responsibility  tax and maritime legislation and regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 
the united states  canada and various state government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies that could adversely impact the cruise vacation industry 
some environmental groups have lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact 
current and future environmental laws and regulations  or liabilities arising from past or future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances or to ship discharges  could increase our cost of compliance or otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we are subject to various international  national  state and local laws  regulations and treaties that govern  among other things  safety standards applicable to our ships  health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers  security standards onboard our ships and at the ship port interface areas  and financial responsibilities to our passengers 
these issues are  and we believe will continue to be  an area of focus by the relevant authorities 
this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 
pursuant to the western hemisphere travel initiative  as of january   united states citizens will be required to carry a passport or  if available  a people access security service pass card  for travel by land or sea to or from certain countries and areas that are currently exempt from passport requirements  such as the caribbean  canada and mexico 
the state department and the department of homeland security are collaborating on the development of the pass card system 
the pass card is a secure credential that verifies the citizenship and identity of us nationals who re enter the united states and is seen as a less expensive alternative to a passport 
since many cruise customers visiting these destinations may not currently have passports or may not obtain a pass card if and when available  it is likely that this will have some negative effect on our bookings and future net revenue yields when the regulations take effect 
there are a number of factors that could influence the ultimate impact of these regulations  such as customer travel patterns  the cost and ease of obtaining pass cards  customer price sensitivity and the cost and effectiveness of mitigating programs we and others have established or will establish 
recently  the state of alaska instituted new state taxes and operating regulations which will impact the cruise industry operating in alaska  and could result in a reduction in demand for alaska cruises 
it is possible that other states  countries or ports of call that we regularly visit may decide to also assess new taxes specifically 
table of contents targeted to the cruise industry  which could increase our operating costs and or could decrease the demand for cruises and ultimately decrease our net revenue yields 
due to the size of our ships operating in alaska at this time  we are not currently impacted by these new taxes or operating regulations 
however  there is no guaranty that these size requirements will not be reduced or similar actions enacted in other waters in which we operate or may operate within the future 
increases in operating  financing and tax costs could adversely affect our results because we may not be able to recover these increased costs through price increases of our cruise vacations 
we are subject to various statutory and regulatory directives in the united states addressing homeland security concerns that may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations 
various government agencies within the department of homeland security dhs including the transportation security administration  the us coast guard and the us bureau of customs and border protection  have adopted  and may adopt in the future  new rules  policies or regulations or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  rules  policies or regulations  compliance with which could increase our costs or result in loss of revenue 
the coast guard s new maritime security regulations  issued pursuant to the maritime transportation security act of  require us to operate our ships and facilities pursuant to both the maritime security regulations and approved security plans 
our ships and facilities are subject to periodic security compliance verification examinations by the coast guard 
a failure to operate in accordance with the maritime security regulations or the approved security plan may result in the imposition of a fine or control and compliance measures  including the suspension or revocation of the security plan  thereby making the ship or facility ineligible to operate 
we are also required to audit these security plans on an annual basis and  if necessary  submit amendments to the coast guard for their review and approval 
failure to timely submit the necessary amendments may lead to the imposition of the fines and control and compliance measures mentioned above 
failure to meet the requirements of the maritime security regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
dhs may adopt additional security related regulations  including new requirements for screening of passengers and our reimbursement to the agency for the cost of security services 
these new security related regulations could have an adverse impact on our ability to efficiently process passengers or could increase our operating costs 
us maritime laws restrict foreign ownership of our stock  and the repeal  suspension or substantial amendment of these laws could increase competition on inland waterways and have a material adverse effect on our business 
us maritime laws require that  to be eligible to operate a ship transporting non proprietary cargo on united states inland waterways  the company that owns the ship must be controlled and owned by united states citizens at each tier of its ownership 
such laws therefore restrict  directly or indirectly  foreign ownership interests in the entities that directly or indirectly own the ships which we operate on the inland waterways 
if we at any point cease to be owned by us citizens  we may become subject to penalties and risk forfeiture of our inland waterways operations 
we are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions 
us maritime laws continue to be in effect and supported by the us congress and the current administration 
however  we cannot assure you that such laws will not be repealed  suspended or amended in the future 
if these laws were to be repealed  suspended or substantially amended and  as a consequence  competitors with lower operating costs were to enter the inland waterways market  our business likely would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our advantages as a united states citizen operator of us ships could be eroded over time as there continue to be periodic efforts and attempts by foreign investors to circumvent certain aspects of us maritime laws 

table of contents our employees are covered by federal maritime laws that may subject us to job related claims in addition to those provided by state laws 
many of our cruise segment employees are covered by federal maritime laws  including provisions of the jones act  the longshore and harbor workers act and the seaman s wage act 
these laws typically operate to make liability limits established by state workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and to permit these employees and their representatives to pursue actions against employers for job related injuries in federal court 
because we are not generally protected by the limits imposed by state workers compensation statutes for these employees  we may have greater exposure for any claims made by these employees than is customary in the individual states 
past and future environmental  safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that reduce our profits 
we are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations 
our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which  if improperly handled or disposed of  could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities 
it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial  legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations 
the applicable regulations  as well as the technology and length of time available to comply with those regulations  continue to develop and change 
in addition  our past activities could also have a material impact on us 
the federal maritime commission regulates passenger ships with or more passenger berths departing from us ports and requires that operators post security to be used in the event the operator fails to provide cruise services  or otherwise satisfy certain financial standards 
we have secured a million surety bond as security under the federal maritime commission 
our ability to secure such a security instrument in the future may result in undue burden on the part of the company and may require that we make additional financial deposits directly with the federal maritime commission in proportion with advance passenger deposits received 
we currently maintain liquor licenses in various states for our ships 
we do not anticipate any material expenses or other material adverse developments with respect to these licenses or future renewals 
however  in the event such developments do occur  we may be required to restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages on all or portions of our cruises 
in connection with these applications or otherwise  we may be required to become qualified to do business in  or to pay or remit various types of taxes or fees to  certain states or political subdivisions thereof 
in addition  we may be subject to fines or other penalties for failure to comply with laws and regulations of one or more states requiring licensing  qualification or other action 
neither the cost of compliance by us with such regulations  nor the penalties imposed or sought to be imposed on us for noncompliance have been material in the past 
however  no assurance can be given that such costs or penalties may not increase or become material in the future 
risks related to the windstar cruises acquisition the failure to successfully integrate windstar cruises business and operations in the expected time frame  or at all  may adversely affect our future results 
we believe that the acquisition of windstar cruises will result in certain benefits  including the addition of international cruise operations 
however  to realize these anticipated benefits  we must successfully integrate windstar cruises 
the success of the acquisition will depend on our ability to realize these anticipated benefits 
we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on a timely basis  or at all  for a variety of reasons  including the following failure to successfully manage relationships with customers  diversion of management resources from our business to integration related issues  
table of contents potential difficulties integrating and harmonizing financial systems  and failure to successfully manage and operate the business through third party management contracts 
as a result  the integration may result in additional and unforeseen delays and expenses 
further  the size of the transaction may make the integration difficult  expensive and disruptive  adversely affecting our revenues and earnings  and implementation of integration efforts may divert management s attention from other strategic priorities 
if we are not able to successfully integrate windstar cruises business and operations  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 
the windstar cruises acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions that  if not satisfied or waived  will result in the acquisition not being completed  which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the acquisition is subject to customary conditions at closing  including approval by the federal trade commission 
if any condition to the acquisition is not satisfied or  if permissible  waived  the acquisition will not be completed 
in addition  we or holland america line  a division of carnival corporation  may terminate the purchase agreement in certain circumstances 
if we and holland america line do not complete the acquisition  the market price of our common stock may fluctuate to the extent that the current market prices of those shares reflect a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed 
we will also be obligated to pay certain investment banking  financing  legal and accounting fees and related expenses in connection with the acquisition  whether or not the acquisition is completed 
furthermore  if the acquisition is not consummated because we have breached the purchase agreement  including for failure to obtain sufficient financing  we may be required to pay damages to holland america line 
in addition  we have diverted significant management resources in an effort to complete the acquisition 
if the acquisition is not completed  we will have incurred significant costs  including the diversion of management resources  for which we will have received little or no benefit 
risks related to our corporate structure and stock we may not be able to fulfill our dividend policy in the future on september   our board of directors adopted a dividend policy paying stockholders per share annually  distributable at per share on a quarterly basis 
dividend payments  however  are not guaranteed and our board of directors may decide  in its absolute discretion  at any time and for any reason  not to pay dividends 
in the future we may not be able to pay or maintain dividends 
we also may not be able to maintain our current level of dividends or increase them over time 
we intend to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy  however  our ability to pay  maintain or expand cash dividends to our stockholders and to execute our dividend policy is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors 
we may not have the necessary funds to pay dividends on our common stock 
we will require continuing  significant cash flow in order for us to make payments of regular dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy 
further  the payment of cash dividends  if any  depends on our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
moreover  we may in the future become subject to contractual restrictions on  or prohibitions against  the payment of dividends 
some of the factors are beyond our control and a change in any such factor could affect our ability to pay dividends on our common shares 
rising interest rates may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
because we have a dividend policy providing for the payment of regular dividends to our stockholders  interest rates may affect  at times significantly  the market price of our common stock 
in general  as interest rates increase  the market price of our common stock could decline 
interest rates remain at moderate levels and  therefore  the value of our common stock may decline if interest rates rise in the future 

table of contents we have only a limited history of paying cash dividends on our common stock and we currently intend to retain a substantial portion of our future earnings  if any  to make payments of principal and interest on our substantial indebtedness and to fund the development and growth of our businesses 
the failure to maintain or pay dividends would adversely affect our share price 
we have adopted a dividend policy that reflects our intention to distribute a portion of the cash generated by our business in excess of operating needs  interest and principal payments on our indebtedness and capital expenditures as regular dividends to our stockholders 
while we intend to maintain our dividend policy  there can be no assurance as to the amount and frequency of any such dividend or that a dividend will be paid at all or whether our dividend policy will be maintained 
if we are unable to fulfill our dividend policy  or pay dividends at levels anticipated by investors  the market price of our shares may be negatively affected 
our dividend policy may limit our ability to pursue growth opportunities 
our dividend policy  to the extent implemented  may significantly restrict our cash reserves and may adversely affect our ability to fund unexpected capital expenditures as well as our ability to make interest and principal repayments on indebtedness 
further  our dividend policy  to the extent implemented  may significantly constrain our ability to finance any material expansion of our business or to fund our operations more than if we had retained such cash flow from our operations 
in addition  our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business  including through acquisitions or increased capital spending  will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third party financing 
as a result  we may be required to borrow additional money or raise capital by issuing equity securities  which may not be possible on attractive terms or at all 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
we are incorporated in delaware 
certain anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as currently in effect  could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
these provisions may delay or prevent the acquisition of us  even if the acquisition may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
in addition  they may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  which is responsible for appointing the members of our management 
provisions in our charter documents may make a change of control of our company more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock  without any vote or action by our stockholders 
thus  our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock 
these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company 
in addition  a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors 
our certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors  whereby directors serve for three year terms  with approximately one third of the directors coming up for reelection each year 
having a staggered board of directors would make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest  which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors 
additionally  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally prohibits stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us in certain circumstances 
section of the delaware general corporation law provides that  
table of contents subject to specified exceptions  a delaware corporation shall not engage in business combinations with any entity that acquires enough shares of our common stock without the consent of our board of directors to be considered an interested stockholder under delaware law for a three year period following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
neither our certificate of incorporation or bylaws contains an election  as permitted by delaware law  to be exempt from the requirements of section anti takeover and transferability limitations of us ownership requirements may adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock 
one of the requirements for having us flagged ships operating in us domestic trade is that of our stockholders must be us citizens and that non us citizens cannot exercise control of us 
we have explored adding restrictions to our certificate of incorporation limiting the transferability of our common stock or control to non us citizens to preserve our us flagged status 
we believe that such limitations may have the effect of decreasing the liquidity of our common stock  thereby making it more difficult for investors to dispose of their shares in an orderly manner 
we have also explored adding legends to our stock certificates to indicate the citizenship of our stockholders to facilitate our ability to monitor and control our us citizenship 
such precautions have not been added  but may be put into effect in the near term 
such provisions and the level of ownership by insiders and our largest shareholders  we believe  may deter a change in control and limit non us citizens  including corporations and individuals  purchases of our common stock

table of contents our strategy for our cruise segment is to become a leader in the luxury small ship cruise segment 
a key part of our business strategy is making cruise acquisitions that we believe are complementary to our cruise business 
we believe that by acquiring or developing strong brands in the luxury  small ship category we can become a global provider of vacation experiences to unique and desirable destinations 
we intend to continue evaluating and considering acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our cruise operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those which impact our most critical accounting policies  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  within the framework of current accounting literature 
our businesses are seasonal 
historically  we have recognized the majority of our operating results in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year 
as a result of our cruise related acquisitions and the size of our cruise operations in relation to our overall operations  we anticipate that beginning in the majority of our operating results will be recognized in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year  which coincides with our cruising season 
our annual results would be adversely affected if our revenue were to be substantially below seasonal norms during the second and third quarters of the year 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe require the most significant judgments and estimates  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred 
passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other cruise revenues passenger ticket revenue is recorded net of applicable discounts 
passenger ticket revenue and related costs of revenue are recognized when the cruise is completed 
we generally receive from our customers a partially refundable deposit within one week of booking a tour  with the balance typically remitted days prior to the departure date 
if customers cancel their trip  the nonrefundable portion of their deposit is recognized as revenue on the date of cancellation 
passenger revenue representing travel insurance purchased at the time of reservation is recognized upon the completion of the cruise or passenger cancellation  whichever is earlier and our obligation has been met 
onboard and other cruise revenue are comprised of beverage and souvenir sales and optional shore excursions are deferred and recognized as revenue when the cruise is completed 
marine revenue we recognize revenue for marine and related services in accordance with the respective contracts 
revenues from fixed price marine construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date to our estimate of total cost for each contract 
this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
revenues from cost plus contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred  plus the fee earned 
an amount equal to contract costs attributable to claims is included in revenues when realization is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated 

table of contents contract costs include all direct materials  labor and subcontractors  and those indirect costs directly related to contract performance  such as payroll taxes and employee benefits 
other indirect costs  such as equipment rental  repairs and depreciation  are treated as cost of revenues earned  but are not allocated to specific jobs 
general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
a provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts is made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability  and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income  and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
we recognize shipyard related revenue upon the completion and delivery of services performed 
the asset  costs in excess of billings on construction contracts  represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability  billings in excess of costs on construction contracts  represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
travel  incentive and event related we bill travel participants  mainly consisting of large corporations  in advance  of which the cash received is recorded as a participant deposit 
we pay for certain direct program costs such as airfare  hotel and other program costs in advance of travel  which are recorded as prepaid program costs 
we recognize travel revenue and related costs when travel convenes and classify such revenue as travel and incentive related 
this revenue is reported on a net basis  reflecting the net effect of gross billings to the client less any direct program costs 
revenue from hotel reservation  registration and related travel services is recognized when the convention operates 
revenue from the sale of merchandise is recognized when the merchandise is shipped  the service has been provided or when the redemption periods have expired 
revenue from pre paid  certificate based merchandise incentive programs is deferred until our obligations are fulfilled or upon management s estimates based upon historical trends that it is remote that the certificate will be redeemed 
these revenues are reported on a net basis  reflecting the net effect of gross billings to the client less any direct program or merchandise costs 
net insurance premiums earned insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of the insurance contracts in proportion to the amount of the insurance coverage provided 
the insurance contracts are typically twelve months in duration and are considered short duration contracts 
unearned premiums represent the unearned portion of the insurance contracts as of the balance sheet date 
ceded reinsurance premiums relate to reinsurance purchased excess of loss and aggregate stop loss to mitigate potential losses from severe adverse loss development  both on a per accident claim basis and in the aggregate 
these ceded reinsurance transactions are recognized as a reduction of premium revenue in the same manner in which the insurance contract is recognized as premium revenue 
license fees revenue from license fees is recognized based on a contracted percentage of total program receipts recorded from the licensing source 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
cost of maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred 
major additions and betterments are capitalized 
our ships are capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method over the expected useful life ranging up to years  net of a residual value which generally is approximately 
ship 
table of contents replacement parts are capitalized and depreciated upon being placed in service 
office and shop equipment is capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method over the expected useful life of the equipment  ranging up to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the expected useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease 
we perform reviews for the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when property and equipment are sold or retired  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations 
judgments and estimates made related to property and equipment are affected by factors such as economic conditions  changes in resale values and changes in operating performance 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
management evaluates recoverability using both subjective and objective factors 
subjective factors include the evaluation of industry and product trends and our strategic focus 
objective factors include management s best estimates of projected future earnings and cash flows 
we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair market value of each of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangibles when performing our impairment tests 
assumptions used include growth rates for revenues and expenses  investment yields on deposits  any future capital expenditure requirements and appropriate discount rates 
we established reporting units based on our current reporting structure 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it related to each reporting unit 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
the majority of our intangible assets were assigned lives based on contract values associated with each intangible asset 
we amortize our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from to years depending on the contract term where applicable 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs represent those costs  commissions and other costs of acquiring insurance  that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal insurance 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies or reinsurance treaties to which they relate 
deferred policy acquisition costs represent those costs directly related to the unearned premiums as of the balance sheet date 
we consider anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these costs 
at december   we believe our deferred policy acquisition costs are recoverable 
reserve for loss and loss adjustment reserves the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses includes an amount determined from loss reports and individual cases and an amount for losses incurred but not reported 
such liabilities are based on estimates and  while we believe that the amount is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts provided 
anticipated deductible recoveries from insureds are recorded as reinsurance recoverables at the time the liability for unpaid claims is established 
other recoveries on unsettled claims  such as salvage and subrogation  are estimated by management and adjusted upon collection 

table of contents reinsurance in the normal course of our reinsurance business  we seek to reduce the loss that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the reinsured policy 
with respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts  the amount by which the liabilities associated with the reinsured policies exceed the amounts paid is amortized to income over the estimated remaining settlement period 
the effects of subsequent changes in estimated or actual cash flows are accounted for by adjusting the previously deferred amount to the balance that would have existed had the revised estimate been available at the inception of the reinsurance transaction  with a corresponding charge or credit to income 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the fair value approach in sfas r is similar to the fair value approach described in sfas no 
in  we used the black scholes merton formula to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
we adopted sfas r  using the modified prospective method  beginning january  based on the terms of our plans  we did not have a cumulative effect related to our plans 
we also elected to continue to estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes merton formula 
using the black scholes merton formula to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  risk free interest rates  our dividend yield and the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on our consolidated statements of operations 
on november  the fasb issued fsp sfas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards sfas r 
the company has elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in sfas r for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation expense  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that were outstanding at the company s adoption of sfas r 
in addition  in accordance with sfas r  sfas and eitf topic d  intraperiod tax allocation of the tax effect of pretax income from continuing operations  the company has elected to recognize excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid in capital only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company 
the company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the 
table of contents carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in making such determination  a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state liabilities 
our estimates may include  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time that we prepare our income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
tax contingency reserves result from our estimates of potential liabilities resulting from differences between actual and audited results 
changes in our tax contingency reserves may result from resolution of audits of prior year filings  the expiration of the statute of limitations  changes in tax laws and current year estimates for asserted and unasserted items 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
significant changes in our estimates could adversely affect our reported results 
pretax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to us taxation when effectively repatriated 
us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes were not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in its foreign subsidiaries 
it is not practical to determine the amount of undistributed earnings or income tax payable in the event the company repatriated all undistributed foreign earnings 
however  if these earnings were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  the company would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes  offset by an adjustment for foreign tax credits 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin no

table of contents we expect cruise related revenues to increase substantially in as a result of both our pending acquisition of windstar cruises as well as the use of our full seven vessel majestic america line fleet 
during  we only operated four of our seven ships  but anticipate operating all seven for periods of time during we also expect that in future periods the primary source of revenue from our marine segment will be attributable to the operations of bellingham marine of which only five months of operations were reflected during as we acquired bellingham marine on july  as of december   we had a backlog of million for marina projects under construction in  which we currently anticipate to be completed within our backlog represents an estimate of the remaining future gross revenue from existing signed contracts and contracts which have been awarded with a defined scope of work and contract value and on which we have begun work with verbal client approval 
we do not believe that our backlog is fully indicative of the amount of potential future revenue that we may achieve due to the short term nature of the contracts under which we generally provide our services compared to the long term nature of the projects and since our backlog is dependent upon the completion of numerous individual projects which are subject to certain factors that can alter the ultimate timing  completion and amount of backlog recognition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business attributable to changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio  foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices 
market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk our available for sale securities included debt securities of million at december  and are subject to market risk 
the potential change in the fair value of these investments  assuming a basis point increase in interest rates relating to the debt securities would be approximately  the following table represents principal cash flows from available for sale debt securities outstanding as of december  by contractual maturity date  and the relative fair value and average interest rate amounts in thousands  except interest rates december  expected maturity date year ending december  cost fair value debt securities us government and agency obligations corporate bonds state and political subdivisions interest receivable total debt securities interest rate on debt securities foreign currency exchange risk our foreign currency exchange risk relates to the marina construction operations which are transacted outside of the us foreign currency is transacted in the local currency of the country in which we have construction contracts 
we do not believe that at strengthening of the foreign currencies in which we operate would have a material impact on our operations 
as the cruise segment expands into international operations upon our consummation of our pending windstar cruises acquisition in april  our foreign currency exchange risk exposure will increase 
at this time we are not able to quantify combined exposures within the cruise and marine segments subsequent to the windstar cruises acquisition 

table of contents fuel price risk our fuel price risk primarily relates to our cruise segment and the direct consumption of fuel on our ships 
fuel cost as a percentage of our total passenger ticket revenue was approximately for the year ended december  we estimate that a hypothetical increase in our weighted average fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december  would increase our fuel cost by approximately million 
our exposure to fuel price risk will increase subsequent to our consummation of our pending windstar cruises acquisition in april at this time we are not able to quantify the exposure related to fuel price risk subsequent to the windstar cruises acquisition
