there remains an unspecified amount of securities available under the third shelf 
to date  no securities have been issued under either the initial shelf or second shelf 
as a consequence of the late filing of the form k  kcs is ineligible to use any of these shelf registration statements until it has timely filed all periodic reports required under section a or section d of the exchange act during the twelve calendar months and any portion of the month after the late form k filing was made 
kcs was also ineligible to use the shelf registration statements during the period in which it failed to pay dividends on its preferred stock  series c preferred stock and series d preferred stock 
kcs paid the accrued and unpaid dividends and current dividends on the series c preferred stock and series d preferred stock on february  kcs believes it will be eligible to use the shelf registration statements commencing may   provided kcs continues to pay dividends on its preferred stock  timely files all periodic reports required under the exchange act and otherwise meets the requirements for short form registration under form s critical accounting policies and estimates kcs accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to an understanding of kcs historical and future performance 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of kcs board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the selection  application and disclosure of the company s critical accounting policies and estimates 
depreciation of property and equipment 
the railroad industry is extremely capital intensive 
maintenance and the depreciation of operating assets constitute a substantial operating expense for kcs  as well as the railroad industry as a whole 
the company capitalizes costs relating to additions and replacements of property and equipment  including certain overhead costs representing the indirect costs associated with construction and improvement projects 
overhead factors are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current costs using the full absorption method 
all of these costs are depreciated using the group method consistent with industry standards and rules established by the stb 
the cost of property and equipment normally retired  less salvage value  is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the operating assets using group straight line rates for financial statement purposes 
the stb approves the depreciation rates used by kcsr excluding the amortization of computer software but not for kcsm 
both kcsr and kcsm periodically conduct studies of depreciation rates for properties and equipment and implements approved changes  as necessary  to depreciation rates 
these studies take into consideration the historical retirement experience of similar assets  the current condition of the assets  current operations and potential changes in technology  estimated salvage value of the assets  and industry regulations 
for all other consolidated subsidiaries  depreciation is derived based upon the asset value in excess of estimated salvage value using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting purposes 
depreciation is based upon estimates of the useful lives of assets as well as their net salvage value at the end of their useful lives 
estimation of the useful lives of assets that are long lived as 
table of contents well as their salvage value requires significant management judgment 
accordingly  management believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation expense are critical 
currently  kcsr and kcsm depreciate operating assets  including road and structures  rolling stock and equipment  and capitalized leases generally over a range of to years depending upon the estimated life of the particular asset 
in addition to the adjustment to rates as a result of the depreciation studies  certain other events could occur that would materially affect the company s estimates and assumptions related to depreciation 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management s assumptions regarding kcs ability to realize the return of its investment in operating assets and  therefore  affect the amount of depreciation expense to charge against both current and future revenues 
because depreciation expense is a function of analytical studies made of property  plant and equipment  subsequent studies could result in different estimates of useful lives and net salvage values 
if future depreciation studies yield results indicating that the assets have shorter lives as a result of obsolescence  physical condition  changes in technology or changes in net salvage values  the estimate of depreciation expense could increase 
likewise  if future studies indicate that assets have longer lives  the estimate of depreciation expense could decrease 
kcsr depreciation review 
during the year ended december   kcsr engaged a civil engineering firm with expertise in railway property usage to conduct a study to evaluate depreciation rates for properties and equipment 
the study centered on evaluating actual historical replacement patterns to assess future lives and indicated that kcsr was depreciating its property over shorter periods than the assets were actually used  as estimated by the study 
the effect of this change in estimate was a million decrease in depreciation expense for the year ended december  kcsm depreciation review 
for the year ended december   kcsm adopted the group depreciation method for consistency with kcsr during accordingly  changes were made to certain historical depreciation rates 
unlike kcsr  kcsm depreciation rates are not subject to the approval of the stb  accordingly  the changes to the depreciation rates were applied in during the year ended december   kcsm engaged a civil engineering firm with expertise in railway property usage to conduct an analysis of depreciation rates for properties and equipment 
the analysis centered on evaluating actual historical replacement patterns to assess future lives and indicated that kcsm was depreciating its property over shorter periods than the assets were actually utilized 
as a result  depreciation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of reflected an adjustment totaling million  to reduce depreciation expense as recorded in the second and third quarters of concession rights and related assets are amortized over the shorter of their remaining useful lives as determined by the kcsm depreciation review or the life of the concession 
provision for environmental remediation 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations in the us and mexico 
kcs conducts studies  as well as site surveys  to determine the extent of environmental damage and the necessary requirements to remediate this damage 
these studies incorporate the analysis of internal environmental engineering staff and consultation with legal counsel 
from these studies and surveys  a range of estimates of the costs involved is derived 
these cost estimates are based on forecasts of the total future direct costs related to environmental remediation and change periodically as additional or better information becomes available as to the extent of site remediation required  if any 
kcs accrues for the cost of remediation where the obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated 
cost estimates can be influenced by advanced technologies related to the detection  appropriate remedial course of action and anticipated cost 
certain changes could occur that would materially affect management s estimates and assumptions related to costs for environmental remediation 
if kcs becomes subject to more stringent environmental remediation costs at known sites  discovers additional contamination  discovers previously unknown sites  or becomes subject to related personal or property damage  kcs could incur additional costs that could be significant in connection with its environmental remediation 
accordingly  
table of contents management believes that estimates related to the accrual of environmental remediation liabilities are critical to kcs results of operations 
environmental remediation expense was million for the year ended december   and was included in purchased services expense on the consolidated statements of income 
additionally  as of december   kcs had a liability for environmental remediation of million 
this amount was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon the studies and site surveys described above and in accordance with sfas provision for casualty claims 
due to the nature of railroad operations  claims related to personal injuries and third party liabilities resulting from crossing collisions and derailments  as well as claims related to personal property damage and other casualties  is a substantial expense to kcs 
claims are estimated and recorded for known reported occurrences as well as for incurred but not reported ibnr occurrences 
consistent with the general practice within the railroad industry  the estimated liability for these casualty expenses is actuarially determined on an undiscounted basis 
in estimating the liability for casualty claims  kcs obtains an estimate from an independent third party actuarial firm  which calculates an estimate using historical experience and estimates of claim costs as well as numerous assumptions regarding factors relevant to the derivation of an estimate of future claim costs 
personal injury and casualty claims are subject to a significant degree of uncertainty  especially estimates related to incurred but not reported personal injuries for which a party has yet to assert a claim 
in deriving an estimate of the provision for casualty claims  management must make assumptions related to substantially uncertain matters injury severity  claimant age and legal jurisdiction 
changes in the assumptions used for actuarial studies could have a material effect on the estimate of the provision for casualty claims 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the liability for personal injuries and other casualty claims is critical to kcs results of operations 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
for the year ended december   casualty expense equaled million and was included in casualties and insurance expense in the consolidated statements of income 
based on the methods described above and information available as of december   the liability for casualty claims was million 
for purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis  if the december  reserve were adjusted increased or decreased by  casualty expense would change million 
provision for income taxes 
deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability of kcs 
for financial reporting purposes  management determines the current tax liability  as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities  in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes as specified in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred into the future 
currently payable income taxes represent the liability related to kcs us  state and mexican income tax returns for the current year and anticipated tax payments resulting from income tax audits while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on the balance sheet 
the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as measured using the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when these differences reverse 
in addition  the tax provision for mexico is further complicated by the impacts of inflation as well as the exchange rate  both of which can have a significant impact on the calculation 
in addition to estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences  management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary 
if the differences are temporary  management must estimate the timing of their reversal  and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient 
table of contents to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets of kcs 
accordingly  management believes that the estimates related to the provision for income taxes is critical to the company s results of operations 
other 
derivative instruments 
kcs does not engage in the trading of derivatives 
management s objective for using derivative instruments is to manage fuel and currency risk to mitigate the impact of their fluctuations 
kcs accounts for derivative transactions under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended  as set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
in general  the company enters into derivative transactions in limited situations based on management s assessment of current market conditions and perceived risks 
management intends to respond to evolving business and market conditions in order to manage risks and exposures associated with various operations  and in so doing  may enter into such transactions more frequently as deemed appropriate 
fuel derivative transactions 
fuel expense is a significant component of operating expenses 
fuel costs are affected by i traffic levels  ii efficiency of operations and equipment  and iii fuel market conditions 
kcs enters into transactions  such as forward purchase commitments and commodity swap transactions from time to time  to stabilize the price for future fuel purchases and protect operating results against adverse fuel price fluctuations 
these derivative instruments hedge against fluctuations in the price of no 
gulf coast heating oil  the commodity on which the company s diesel fuel prices are based 
the use of certain risk management strategies enables risk to be reduced related to rising diesel fuel prices 
on december   kcs was party to fuel swap agreements for million gallons of fuel 
foreign exchange matters 
kcsm uses the dollar as its functional currency 
earnings from kcsm included in results of operations reflect any transaction gains and losses that kcsm records in the process of translating certain transactions from pesos to dollars 
kcs follows the requirements outlined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
foreign currency translation  and related authoritative guidance 
the company continues to evaluate existing alternatives with respect to utilizing foreign currency instruments to hedge the dollar investment in kcsm as market conditions change or exchange rates fluctuate 
as of december   kcsm did not have any outstanding forward contracts 
litigation 
the company is a party to various legal proceedings and administrative actions  all of which are of an ordinary  routine nature and incidental to its operations 
included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by current and former employees for job related injuries and by third parties for injuries related to railroad operations 
kcs aggressively defends these matters and has established liability reserves that management believes are adequate to cover expected costs 
although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any legal proceeding  in the opinion of the company s management  other than those proceedings described in detail below  such proceedings and actions should not  individually  or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
reinsurance litigation 
as the company has previously reported  insurance companies who provided insurance to the company filed an action in federal court in vermont the reinsurance litigation seeking a declaration that they have no obligation to indemnify the company concerning a particular casualty claim 
that claim  kemp  et al v 
the kansas city southern railway company  et al  in the circuit court of jackson county  missouri the kemp litigation went to trial in september the company reached a settlement with the plaintiffs in the kemp litigation 
the company has also reached settlements with various parties  including several of the insurance companies involved in the reinsurance litigation  to indemnify the company for a significant portion of the settlement 
the kemp settlement is fully reflected in the company s financial statements and the company has no further risk associated with this litigation 
the company is however continuing the reinsurance litigation against certain other insurance companies  seeking to establish their obligation to indemnify the company for their share of the settlement with kemp

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures concerning market risk kcs utilizes various financial instruments that have certain inherent market risks  but these instruments have not been entered into for trading purposes 
the following information  together with information included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risk to kcs 
interest rate sensitivity 
floating rate indebtedness totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
two credit agreements  each comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility  contain variable rate debt which accrues interest based on target interest indexes london interbank offered rate libor or an alternative base rate plus an applicable spread  as set forth in each credit agreement 
given the balance of million of variable rate debt at december   kcs is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  a hypothetical basis points increase in each of the respective target interest indexes would result in additional interest expense of million on an annualized basis for the floating rate instruments issued by the company as of december  based upon the borrowing rates available to kcs and its subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average maturities  the fair value of the long term debt was approximately  million at december   and  million at december  commodity price sensitivity 
as described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other derivative instruments of this form k  kcs periodically participates in diesel fuel purchase commitment and swap transactions 
at december   kcs was party to fuel swap agreements for million gallons 
subsequent to december   kcs entered into fuel swap agreements for another million gallons 
the company also holds fuel inventories for use in operations 
these inventories are not material to kcs overall financial position 
with the exception of the fuel currently hedged under fuel swap transactions for  fuel costs are expected to mirror market conditions in kcs also cushions the impact of increased fuel costs through fuel surcharge revenues from customers 
assuming annual consumption of million gallons  a change in the price per gallon of fuel would cause a million change in operating expenses 
foreign exchange sensitivity 
kcsm uses the dollar as its functional currency 
earnings from kcsm included in the company s results of operations reflect revaluation gains and losses that kcsm records in the process of translating certain transactions from pesos to dollars 
therefore  the company has exposure to fluctuations in the value of the peso 
while not currently utilizing foreign currency instruments to hedge kcs 
table of contents dollar investment in kcsm  existing alternatives are evaluated as market conditions and exchange rates fluctuate 
for example  a hypothetical increase in the us dollar to the mexican peso exchange rate on net monetary assets of ps  million would result in a translation loss of approximately million and a decrease in the exchange rate would result in a translation gain of approximately million 
inflation 
us generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost  which does not reflect the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property 
due to the capital intensive nature of kcs business  the replacement cost of these assets would be substantially greater than the amounts reported under the historical cost basis
