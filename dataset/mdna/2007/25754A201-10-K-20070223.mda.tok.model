item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our fiscal year typically includes weeks  comprised of three twelve week quarters and one sixteen week quarter 
every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or rd week in the fourth quarter of that year 
fiscal consisted of weeks  while fiscal and fiscal consisted of weeks 
we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending 
we also have a leading international presence 
we operate through a network of company owned stores  all of which are in the united states  and  franchise stores located in all states and in more than countries 
in addition  we operate regional dough manufacturing and distribution centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and distribution centers outside the contiguous united states 
our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our company owned and franchise stores 
changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts 
we monitor both of these metrics very closely  as they directly impact our revenues and profits  and strive to consistently increase the related amounts 
retail sales drive company owned store revenues  royalty payments from franchisees and distribution revenues 
retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino s pizza brand  the success of our marketing promotions and our ability to execute our store operating model and other business strategies 
we devote significant attention to our brand building efforts  which is evident in our system s estimated billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age 
we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino s pizza brand 
we also pay particular attention to the store economics  or the investment performance of a store to its owner  of both our company owned and franchise stores 
we believe that our system s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino s pizza store 
we believe these favorable investment requirements  coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending  as well as high quality and focused menu offerings  drive strong store economics  which  in turn  drive demand for new stores 
in  global retail sales  which are total retail sales at company owned and franchise stores worldwide  increased as compared to this increase in global retail sales was driven by strong international same store sales growth as well as global unit growth  offset in part by a decrease in domestic same store sales 
in  global retail sales increased as compared to  despite having a rd week in  which negatively impacted our global retail sales growth by approximately two percentage points 
this increase in global retail sales was driven by both strong domestic and international same store sales growth as well as global unit growth 
our revenues decreased million in  largely due to lower distribution revenues  due primarily to lower volumes related to decreases in domestic same store sales  and lower food prices  including cheese 
worldwide store counts have increased from  at the beginning of to  at the end of this growth in store counts can be attributed to the growing global acceptance of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system which attracts new franchisees and encourages existing franchisees to grow their business 
domestic same store sales increased and in and  respectively  and decreased in international same store sales increased  and during the same periods 
we believe that our mix of new product introductions and strong value oriented promotional activities have historically produced strong same store sales results 
the company s domestic same store sales results in reflected a weaker economy and the underperformance of our product and promotional offerings during the year 
internationally  same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the concept 
income from operations has increased  from million in to million in this growth in income from operations was primarily the result of increases in global retail sales and related profits from distribution center operations  as well as decreases in general and administrative expenses 
net income increased from million in to million in 
table of contents we are highly leveraged primarily as the result of recapitalizations in and as of december   consolidated long term debt was million 
since  a large portion of our cash flows provided from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 
our senior subordinated notes require no principal payments until maturity in our senior credit facility requires principal payments of million  million  million and million in   and  respectively 
we have decreased our total leverage ratio  or total debt divided by total segment income  from x at the time of our initial public offering to x at the end of  as a result of both debt reductions and continued improved operating performance 
overall  we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant free cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our significant debt but also invest in our business  pay dividends to our shareholders and opportunistically repurchase outstanding common stock 
recent development on february   we announced a recapitalization  which comprises i a tender offer to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  which is expected to expire on march  the equity tender offer  ii a tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due  which is expected to expire on march  the debt tender offer  iii the repayment of all outstanding borrowings and related accrued interest under our current senior secured credit facility and the termination of that facility and iv new borrowings of up to billion in securitized debt  of which million would be a revolving credit facility 
although we are currently negotiating the terms and availability of this securitized debt  we anticipate that we will obtain the funds required to finance the repayment of our existing borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  the equity tender offer and the debt tender offer  as well as to pay all related fees and expenses  from a bridge loan facility we expect to enter into with a syndicate of banks  financial institutions and other entities  that is expected to provide for borrowings of up to billion the bridge loan facility 
we have obtained a commitment  subject to customary conditions  from a syndicate of banks to provide the bridge loan facility 
in this annual report on form k  we refer to the foregoing transactions as the recapitalization 
in addition  following the recapitalization  we expect  subject to the approval of our board of directors  to pay a significant special cash dividend to our shareholders  and our board of directors will consider authorizing future open market repurchases of our common stock 
any such special dividend payment and open market repurchases are expected to use substantially all of any remaining proceeds of the securitized debt and no proceeds  other than under the securitized variable funding senior notes  are expected to be used for working capital or other general corporate purposes 
in the event that a special cash dividend is paid  we have approved a separate dividend equivalent rights policy to i allow holders of vested stock options or options that vest in calendar year  including our directors  executive officers and certain team members  to receive a cash payment in respect of such options equal to the amount of the dividend that would be paid on the shares underlying the options and ii allow holders of unvested stock options to have the option exercise price reduced  to the extent permitted by applicable law  to reflect the amount of the dividend 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible receivables  long lived and intangible assets  insurance and legal matters and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition 
we earn revenues through our network of domestic company owned and franchise stores  dough manufacturing and distribution centers and international operations 
retail sales from company owned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers 
sales of food from our distribution centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies from our distribution centers are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible receivables 
we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews 
these estimates are based on  among other factors  historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category 
additionally  we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while write offs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that future write offs will not exceed historical rates 
specifically  if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long lived and intangible assets 
we record long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and capitalized software  at cost 
for acquisitions of franchise operations  we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets  historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition 
we depreciate and amortize long lived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us 
we review long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the related amounts might be impaired 
we perform related impairment tests on a market level basis for company owned stores 
at december   we determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
however  if our future operating performance were to deteriorate  we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment 
at december   the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value  including the related goodwill 
however  if the future performance of our domestic company owned stores or other reporting units were to deteriorate  we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge 
insurance and legal matters 
we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters 
these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason  we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods 
for certain periods prior to december and for periods after december  we maintain insurance coverage for workers compensation  general liability and owned and non owned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between  and million  depending on the policy year and line of coverage 
the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates  which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions  as well as changes in actual experience  could cause these estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods 
income taxes 
our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet  including tax reserves  also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance or other tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

the company s effective income tax rate decreased percentage points to of pre tax income in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million and cash and cash equivalents of million 
historically  we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities 
we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale  and we generally experience to inventory turns per year 
in addition  our sales are not typically seasonal  which further limits our working capital requirements 
these factors  coupled with significant and ongoing cash flows from operations  which are primarily used to repay long term debt  pay dividends and invest in long term assets  reduce our working capital amounts 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have historically funded capital expenditures and debt repayments from cash flows from operations and expect to in the future 
we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  our advertising fund assets decreased million  from million at january  to million at december  this decrease was due primarily to decreases in same store sales and the timing of receipts and disbursements

the million increase was due primarily to a million increase in repurchases of common stock  a million increase in repayments of long term debt and capital lease obligations and a million decrease in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
these increases in cash used in financing activities were offset in part by a million increase in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt 
on june   we consummated a recapitalization transaction whereby domino s  inc i issued and sold million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior subordinated notes due at a discount resulting in gross proceeds of approximately million  and ii borrowed million in term loans and secured a million revolving credit facility from a consortium of banks collectively  the senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility was subsequently amended primarily to obtain more favorable interest rate margins  to amend the principal amortization schedule  to allow for the repayment of a portion of the senior subordinated notes as part of our ipo in lieu of a required payment under the senior secured credit facility  to allow the payment of dividends to our stockholders and to allow for the purchase and retirement of common stock and to allow for additional term loan borrowings of million in 
table of contents the senior subordinated notes require semi annual interest payments  beginning january  before july   we may  at a price above par  redeem all  but not part  of the senior subordinated notes if a change in control occurs  as defined in the indenture governing the notes 
beginning july   we may redeem some or all of the senior subordinated notes at fixed redemption prices  ranging from of par in to of par in through maturity 
in the event of a change in control  as defined  we will be obligated to repurchase the senior subordinated notes tendered at the option of the holders at a fixed price 
upon a public stock offering  we may use the net proceeds from such offering to repurchase and retire up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due  provided that at least of the original principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due remains outstanding immediately following the repurchase 
during  we used the net proceeds from our ipo to redeem approximately million in principal amount of our senior subordinated notes 
the senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by most of domino s  inc s domestic subsidiaries and one foreign subsidiary and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt of the company 
the senior secured credit facility provides the following credit facilities a term loan and a revolving credit facility 
the initial aggregate borrowings available under the senior secured credit facility were million 
the senior secured credit facility provided borrowings of million in term loans 
the term loan was initially fully borrowed 
term loans outstanding as of december  were million 
borrowings under the term loan bear interest  payable at least quarterly  at either i the higher of a the prime rate at december  and b above the federal reserve reported overnight funds rate  each plus an applicable margin of  or ii libor at december  plus an applicable margin of 
at december   our borrowing rate was for term loan borrowings 
as of december   all borrowings under the term loan were under a libor contract with an interest period of days 
as of december   the senior secured credit facility requires term loan payments of million  million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the timing of our required payments under the senior secured credit facility may change based upon voluntary prepayments and generation of excess cash flow 
we are required to pay between and of the excess cash flow generated 
the required percentage is determined once a year and is based on our leverage ratio at the end of the preceding year 
excess cash flow is calculated as i earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  less ii the sum of debt repayments  capital expenditures  cash interest expense  provision for current taxes and certain other adjustments  if any  which have historically included our recapitalization transaction expenses  comprised of bond tender fees and financing fees  and our ipo expenses  comprised primarily of the payment made to an affiliate of our former majority stockholder in connection with the termination of its management agreement with us 
total debt is divided by the amount in clause i to calculate the leverage ratio 
if the leverage ratio is over  between and or less than  we are obligated to pay  or of the excess cash flows amounts generated  respectively 
the required percentage for to be paid in was 
however  no payment was required in because there is no excess cash flow as calculated as we voluntarily prepaid a significant amount of term loans during upon a public stock offering  we are required to pay down the term loan in an amount equal to of the net proceeds of such offering 
in connection with our ipo  we amended our senior secured credit facility and obtained consent under the facility to permit the use of proceeds described in our offering prospectus filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the final scheduled principal payment on the outstanding borrowings under the term loan is due in june the senior secured credit facility also provides for borrowings of up to million under the revolving credit facility  of which up to million is available for letter of credit advances 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility excluding letters of credit bear interest  payable at least quarterly  at either i the higher of a the prime rate and b above the federal reserve reported overnight funds rate  each plus an applicable margin of between to  or ii libor plus an applicable margin of between to  with margins determined based upon our ratio of indebtedness to ebitda  as defined 
we also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolver 
the fee for letter of credit amounts outstanding ranges from to 
at december   the fee for letter of credit amounts outstanding was 
at december   there was million in available borrowings under the revolving credit facility  with million of letters of credit outstanding 
the revolving credit facility expires in june in and in connection with the proposed transactions  we entered into a five year forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of billion 
this swap was entered into to hedge the variability of future interest rates in contemplation of the bridge loan and securitized debt in connection with the recapitalization 

table of contents based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that the cash generated from our operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements  including payments required under the excess cash flow provisions of our senior secured credit facility  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next several years 
we believe that we will be able to meet these obligations even if we experience no growth in sales or profits 
our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item a  risk factors 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our revolving credit facility or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness  including our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes  or to make anticipated capital expenditures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risks from interest rate changes on our variable rate debt 
management actively monitors this exposure 
we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are also exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices 
during the normal course of business  we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and  as a result  we are subject to volatility in our food costs 
we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk 
we purchase cheese at market prices  which fluctuate on a daily basis 
the cheese block price per pound averaged and in and  respectively 
the estimated change in company owned store food costs from a hypothetical change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately million in this hypothetical change in food cost could be positively or negatively impacted by average ticket changes and product mix changes 
financial derivatives we enter into interest rate swaps  collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing volatility relating to our borrowing costs in addition to fulfilling requirements under our debt agreements 
as of december   we were party to two interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert the fixed interest component on a portion of the debt under our senior subordinated notes to variable libor based rates over the term of the senior subordinated notes 
we are also party to an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts the variable libor component of the effective interest rate on a portion of our debt under our senior secured credit facility to a fixed rate over the stated term 
these agreements are summarized in the following table 
derivative total notional amount term company pays counterparty pays interest rate swap million august july libor plus basis points interest rate swap million august july libor plus basis points interest rate swap million june june libor on february   we announced a recapitalization plan that  if successful  would include the repurchase of all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and the repayment of all borrowings under our senior credit facility

interest rate risk our variable interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on our million of variable interest debt  which is net of related outstanding derivative instruments  was 
we had total interest expense of approximately million in the estimated increase in interest expense for this period from a hypothetical basis point adverse change in applicable variable interest rates would be approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states  which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively  were derived from sales to customers and royalties from franchisees outside the contiguous united states
