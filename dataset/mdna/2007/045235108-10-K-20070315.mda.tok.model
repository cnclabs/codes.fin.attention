item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we derive our revenue primarily from sales of bis monitors  our original equipment manufacturer products including bis module kits and the bisx system and related accessories  which we collectively refer to as equipment  and sales of bis sensors 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from our strategic alliances  primarily with boston scientific corporation 
to assist management in assessing and managing our business  we segregate our revenue by sales by region  sales by products and revenue derived from our strategic alliance  as shown in the following table dollar amounts in thousands domestic revenue percent of total revenue international revenue percent of total revenue total revenue bis sensor revenue percent of total revenue equipment revenue percent of total revenue strategic alliance revenue percent of total revenue total revenue at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
we follow a system of fiscal quarters as opposed to calendar quarters 
under this system  the first three quarters of each fiscal year end on the saturday closest to the end of the calendar quarter and the last quarter of the fiscal year always ends on december we believe our ability to grow our revenue is directly related to our ability to sell our equipment to healthcare organizations and influence our customers after they purchase our equipment to continue to purchase and use our bis sensors 
we believe the increase in our installed base of equipment resulting from the sale of bis monitors and the sale of original equipment manufacturers equipment incorporating our bis module kit or bisx system has been the primary reason for the growth in revenue from the sale of bis sensors 
in order to successfully grow our revenue  we need to continue to focus on both selling our equipment and increasing the use of our sensors 
to achieve this growth  we plan to continue to implement new sales and marketing programs 
we expect that as we grow our business  revenue from the sale of bis sensors will contribute an increasing percentage of product revenue 
additionally  we believe that  over time  revenue from the sale of bis module kits and our bisx system will increase as a percentage of total equipment revenue as healthcare organizations purchase our technology as part of an integrated solution offered by our original equipment manufacturers 
in order to sustain profitability  we believe that we need to continue to maintain our gross profit margin and control the growth of our operating expenses 
to maintain our gross profit margin we believe we must continue to focus on maintaining our average unit sales prices of our bis sensors  increasing revenue from the sale of bis sensors as a percentage of total revenue  as bis sensors have a higher gross profit margin than equipment  and continuing to reduce the costs of manufacturing our products 
for those healthcare organizations desiring to acquire our bis monitors directly from us  we offer two options 
our customers have the option either to purchase bis monitors outright or to acquire bis monitors pursuant to a sales type lease agreement whereby the customer contractually commits to purchase a minimum number of bis sensors per bis monitor per year 
under our sales type leases  customers purchase bis sensors and the bis monitor 
table of contents for the purchase price of the bis sensors plus an additional charge per bis sensor to pay for the purchase price of the bis monitor and related financing costs over the term of the agreement 
we also grant these customers an option to purchase the bis monitors at the end of the term of the agreement  which is typically three to five years 
we recognize equipment revenue under sales type lease agreements either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with interest income recognized over the life of the sales type lease 
the cost of the bis monitor acquired by the customer is recorded as costs of revenue in the same period 
sales type leases accounted for approximately  and of total product revenue in  and  respectively 
under certain limited circumstances  we also offer customers the opportunity to use the bis monitors under our equipment placement program  which we refer to as the ep program 
under the ep program  the customer is granted the right to use the bis monitors for a mutually agreed upon period of time 
during this period  the customer purchases bis sensors at a price that includes a premium above the list price of the bis sensors to cover the rental of the equipment  but without any minimum purchase commitments 
at the end of the agreed upon period  the customer has the option of purchasing the bis monitors  continuing to use them under the ep program or returning them to us 
we have subsidiaries in the netherlands and the united kingdom to facilitate the sale of our products into the international market 
we are continuing to develop our international sales and distribution program through a combination of distributors and marketing partners  including companies with which we have entered into original equipment manufacturer relationships 
we are party to a distribution agreement with nihon kohden corporation to distribute bis monitors in japan 
nihon kohden has received approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare for marketing in japan our a eeg monitor with bis  our a bis monitor  our bis module our product that integrates bis monitoring technology into equipment sold by original equipment manufacturers and  most recently in  our bis xp system 
in january  the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare granted reimbursement approval for use of our bis monitors 
with this approval  healthcare providers in japan are eligible to receive partial reimbursement of  yen each time bis monitoring is used 
sales to nihon kohden represented approximately  and  respectively  of international revenue in  and  respectively 
during the first quarter of  we adopted the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standard revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under sfas no 
r  companies must calculate and record in the statement of operations the cost of equity instruments  such as stock options or restricted stock  awarded to employees for services received  pro forma disclosure is no longer permitted 
the cost of the equity instruments is to be measured based on fair value of the instruments on the date they are granted with certain exceptions and is required to be recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our results of operations and financial position for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles bulletin  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  as such  generally recognized no compensation expense for employee stock options 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding our adoption of sfas no 
r 
various factors may adversely affect our quarterly operating results through the first quarter of and beyond 
these factors include the impact of the shift in our placements from bis monitors to original equipment manufacturer products  which may lead to a reduction in gross margin on equipment  the continued challenges of the worldwide economy and the risk that we may not realize expected benefits of recent industry pronouncements on anesthesia awareness  including the sentinel event alert issued by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  the practice advisory on interoperative awareness  which was approved by the american society of anesthesiologists house of delegates in october and the position statement regarding unintended awareness issued by the american association of nurse anesthetists  or aana 
in addition  in japan  
table of contents nihon kohden only recently received approval of the bis xp system and we may not recognize the potential benefits of this approval for some time  if at all 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made estimates and judgments in determining certain amounts included in the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we do not believe there is a significant likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows revenue recognition we sell our bis monitors primarily through a combination of a direct sales force and distributors 
our original equipment manufacturer products are sold to original equipment manufacturers who in turn sell them to the end user 
bis sensors are sold through a combination of a direct sales force  distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
direct product sales are structured as sales  sales type lease arrangements or sales under our ep program 
we recognize revenue when earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf   revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we also recognize revenue from prepaid license and royalty fees 
this revenue is deferred until product shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of the agreement and license and royalty fees are earned in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements 
in august  we recorded approximately million of deferred revenue related to an oem product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation  which we refer to as the oem product development and distribution agreement 
the deferred revenue is being recognized ratably over the term of the oem product development and distribution agreement  which represents our best estimate of our period of significant continuing obligation to provide boston scientific corporation exclusive distribution rights to certain newly developed technology 
if our estimate of the period of significant continuing obligation is revised  this may have an impact on our revenue recognition of the deferred revenue related to this agreement with boston scientific corporation 
in may  we entered into a product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation  which we refer to as the product development and distribution agreement 
pursuant to this agreement  boston scientific corporation agreed to provide to us up to million to fund the development of products that incorporate eeg analysis technology for the diagnosis of neurological  psychiatric or pain disorders or screening or monitoring patient response to treatment options for such disorders 
revenue is recognized on allowable product development activities pursuant to this agreement as the services are performed and costs are incurred  and we are obligated to spend all of the funding in the research areas related to diagnosing and treating depression and alzheimer s disease 
the amount of revenue recognized under this agreement will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the level of allowable research and development expenses in any given quarter 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for leases  for our sales type lease agreements 
under our sales type leases  customers purchase bis sensors and the bis monitor for the purchase price of the bis sensors plus an additional charge per bis sensor to pay for the purchase price of the bis monitor and related financing costs over the term of the agreement 
the minimum lease payment  consisting of the additional charge per bis sensor  less the unearned interest income  which is computed at the interest rate implicit in the lease  is recorded as the net investment in sales type leases 
we recognize equipment revenue under sales type lease agreements either at 
table of contents shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with interest income recognized over the life of the sales type lease 
the cost of the bis monitor acquired by the customer is recorded as costs of revenue in the same period 
we review and assess the net realizability of our investment in sales type leases at each reporting period 
this review includes determining  on a customer specific basis  if a customer is significantly underperforming relative to the customer s cumulative level of committed bis sensor purchases as required by the sales type lease agreement 
if a customer is underperforming  we record an allowance for lease payments as a charge to revenue to reflect the lower estimate of the net realizable investment in sales type lease balance 
changes in the extent of underperformance in the agreements could increase or decrease the amount of revenue recorded in future periods 
we recognize revenue either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with distributors and original equipment manufacturers in accordance with sab no 
contracts executed for sales to distributors and original equipment manufacturers include a clause that indicates that customer acceptance is limited to confirmation that our products function in accordance with our applicable product specifications in effect at the time of delivery 
formal acceptance by the distributor or original equipment manufacturer is not necessary to recognize revenue provided that we objectively demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
each product is tested prior to shipment to ensure that it meets the applicable product specifications in effect at the time of delivery 
additionally  we have historically had a minimal number of defective products shipped to distributors and original equipment manufacturers  and any defective products are subject to repair or replacement under warranty as distributors and original equipment manufacturers do not have a right of return 
stock based compensation sfas no 
r  which we adopted in the first quarter of fiscal  requires that stock based compensation expense associated with equity instruments be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations  rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions risk free interest rate the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the assumption in the model 
expected term the expected term of an employee option is the period of time for which the option is expected to be outstanding 
we use a monte carlo simulation model to estimate the expected term assumption for the grant date valuation as we believe that this information is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option 
expected volatility in estimating our expected volatility  we consider both trends in historical volatility and the implied volatility of our publicly traded options 
we use a combination of our implied volatility and historical volatility to estimate expected volatility 
we believe that in addition to the relevance of historical volatility  consideration of implied volatility achieves the objectives of sfas no 
r since it represents the expected volatility that marketplace participants would likely use in determining an exchange price for an option  and is therefore an appropriate assumption to use in the calculation of grant date fair value 
we utilized an independent third party with expertise in valuation methodologies to validate the assumptions described above 
additionally  we are required to make assumptions regarding the forfeiture rate 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we used a forfeiture rate of approximately in our calculation at december  we re evaluate this forfeiture rate on a quarterly basis and adjust the rate as necessary 
these assumptions involve significant judgment and estimates 
future stock based compensation expense could vary significantly from the amount recorded in the current period due to changes in assumptions and due to the extent of stock option activity and restricted stock issued in future periods 

table of contents as of december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options and nonvested restricted stock awards was million and million  respectively  which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service periods of months and months  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by making estimates and judgments based on our historical collections experience  current trends  historical write offs of our receivables  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
we also review the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  our credit loss rates in the future may not be consistent with our historical experience 
to the extent that we experience a deterioration in our historical collections experience or increased credit losses  bad debt expense would likely increase in future periods 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or estimated market value  and determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on production history and on our estimated forecast of product demand 
the medical device industry in which we market our products is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances that could result in obsolescence of inventory 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we would need to change our estimate of the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
if revisions are deemed necessary  we would recognize the adjustments in the form of a charge to costs of revenue at the time of the determination 
therefore  although we continually update our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated declines in demand or technological developments  such as the introduction of new products by our competitors  could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
warranty equipment that we sell generally is covered by a warranty period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on our historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  to the extent we experience an increased number of warranty claims or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty expenses will increase  and we may experience decreased gross profit margin and cash flow 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
through the third quarter of  we maintained a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
upon achieving three year cumulative profitability  we began to weigh the positive and negative evidence included in fas accounting for income taxes  on a quarterly basis to determine if we believed that it was more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
in connection with this analysis  we reviewed our cumulative history of earnings before taxes over a three year period and our projections of future taxable income 
as of december   after finalizing our forecast  we concluded that our projections support future taxable income for the foreseeable future  and therefore  we reversed million of our valuation allowance 
our projections of future taxable income include significant judgment and estimation 
if we are not able to achieve sufficient taxable income in future periods  we might need to record additional valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets in future periods that could be material to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the following tables present  for the periods indicated  financial information expressed as a percentage of revenue and a summary of our total revenue

our installed base of bis monitors and original equipment manufacturer products increased approximately to  units at december  compared with  units at december  equipment revenue in increased approximately compared with as the result of an approximate increase in monitor revenue due to an increase of approximately in the number of bis monitors shipped 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in original equipment manufacturer revenue and other equipment revenue 
overall  the flat equipment revenue is primarily attributable to a reduction in average selling prices of both monitors and modules  which was implemented to increase placements of such equipment 
for the year ended december   we recorded strategic alliance revenue of approximately million compared with approximately million for the year ended december  the strategic alliance revenue is primarily attributable to the revenue that we recognized from our agreements with boston scientific corporation 
for the year ended december   approximately million  or  of the million total strategic alliance revenue recognized relates to the product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation compared with approximately million  or  of the total strategic alliance revenue recognized for the year ended december  approximately  relates to the oem product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation for both and we are recognizing the deferred revenue recorded from this agreement ratably over the term of the oem product development and distribution agreement  which represents our best estimate of the period of significant continuing obligation to provide boston scientific corporation exclusive distribution rights to certain newly developed technology 
in february  we amended the oem product development and distribution agreement and as a result of this amendment  the amount of revenue that we recognize on a quarterly basis will decrease by approximately  we will continue to recognize strategic alliance revenue of approximately  on a quarterly basis related to the oem product development and distribution agreement and we expect to recognize strategic alliance revenue related to the product development and distribution agreement as we incur research and development expenses that are allowable under that agreement 
our gross profit margin was approximately of revenue in compared with a gross profit margin of approximately of revenue in the increase in the gross profit margin in compared with was primarily the result of the increased revenue we recognized from our strategic alliance with boston scientific corporation which has no related impact on costs of revenue and increased sales of our bis sensors as a percentage of total product revenue

the remaining increase in compensation and benefits relates to an increase in salary expense of approximately million primarily as a result of additional headcount 
the increase in clinical study expenses and travel 
table of contents and entertainment expenses relates primarily to our research and development efforts in the neuroscience area  particularly related to the continuation of the brite trial 
the brite biomarkers for rapid identification of treatment efficacy in major depression trial is a study to determine the accuracy of using our brain assessment technology  which analyzes electrical activity in the brain  to predict the effectiveness of antidepressant medications 
we expect research and development expenses in to increase compared with sales and marketing

interest income increased to approximately million in from approximately in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in interest income from to was primarily attributable to higher cash and investment balances as a result of amounts received under the product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation  cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and an increase in interest rates 
we expect interest income to increase in compared with due to higher average cash and investment balances 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes comprises a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined it was more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets would be realized and  accordingly  released substantially all of our valuation allowance 
this decision was based on our cumulative history of earnings before taxes for financial reporting purposes over a quarter period and on the projections of expected future taxable income 
the tax assets estimated to be realized in future periods have been calculated by applying a blended federal and state tax rate of  which is based upon the tax rates expected to be in effect  apportioned by jurisdiction  in the periods during which the attributes are expected to be utilized 
changes in this blended rate in future periods could have a material effect on both the tax provision in the period of change as well as the net deferred tax asset carrying value 
we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various dates through we also have an additional  of federal and state net operating losses that are attributable to stock option exercises which will be recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheet once they are realized in accordance with sfas no 
r 
as of december   we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of 
table of contents  and  respectively  which expire at various dates through these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review by the internal revenue service 
ownership changes  as defined under sections and in the internal revenue code  may limit the amount of these tax attributes we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities 
the amount of the annual limitation is determined based on our value immediately prior to the ownership change 
subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years

approximately  relates to the oem product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation 
the deferred revenue that was recorded from this agreement is being recognized ratably over the term of the oem product development and distribution agreement  which represents our best estimate of the period of significant continuing obligation to provide boston scientific corporation exclusive distribution rights to newly developed technology 
on an annual basis  we will continue to recognize strategic alliance revenue of approximately  related to the oem product development and distribution agreement  and we will recognize strategic alliance revenue related to the product development and distribution agreement as we incur research and development expenses that are allowable under the agreement 
our gross profit margin was approximately of revenue in compared with a gross profit margin of approximately of revenue in the decrease in the gross profit margin in compared with was principally the result of three factors

table of contents interest income 
interest income increased to approximately million in from approximately in the increase in interest income from to was primarily attributable to higher cash and investment balances as a result of amounts received under the product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation and also cash received from the exercise of employee stock options 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to approximately  in from approximately  in  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in interest expense in was a result of lower average outstanding debt obligations as we paid off all of our outstanding debt in the third quarter of net income loss 
as a result of the factors discussed above  in we had net income of approximately million compared with net income of approximately  in we recorded a provision for foreign income taxes for the year ended december  of  we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards that have generated significant deferred tax assets 
although we were profitable for the year ended december   we concluded that we would continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax benefits until profitability had been sustained over an appropriate time period and in amounts that were sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited selected operating results for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the two years ended december  we believe that the following selected quarterly information includes all adjustments consisting only of normal  recurring adjustments that we consider necessary to present this information fairly

income taxes our provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred 
table of contents income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined it was more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets would be realized and accordingly  we released substantially all of our valuation allowance 
this decision was based on our cumulative history of earnings before taxes for financial reporting purposes over a quarter period and on the projections of expected future taxable income 
the tax assets estimated to be realized in future periods have been calculated by applying a blended federal and state tax rate of  which is based upon the tax rates expected to be in effect  apportioned by jurisdiction  in the periods during which the attributes are expected to be utilized 
changes in this blended rate in future periods could have a material effect on both the tax provision in the period of change as well as the net deferred tax asset carrying value 
we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various dates through we also have an additional  of federal and state net operating losses that are attributable to stock option exercises which will be recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheet once they are realized in accordance with sfas no

ownership changes  as defined under sections and in the internal revenue code  may limit the amount of these tax attributes we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities 
the amount of the annual limitation is determined based on our value immediately prior to the ownership change 
subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market accounts  certificates of deposit  high grade commercial paper  high grade corporate bonds and debt obligations of various governmental agencies 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made with an average maturity of months or less and a maximum maturity of months 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of the debt instruments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our annual interest income would change by approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the fair values of our investment portfolio at december  and december  would change by approximately  million and  million  respectively  for each basis point increase or decrease in rates 
our investment in sales type leases and line of credit agreements are also subject to market risk 
the interest rates implicit in our sales type leases are fixed and not subject to interest rate risk 
the interest rates on our line of credit agreements are variable and subject to interest rate risk 
the interest rate risk experienced to date related to the lines of credit has been mitigated primarily by the fact that the lines of credit  when drawn on  are generally outstanding for short periods of time in order to fund short term cash requirements 
foreign currency exposure most of our revenue  expenses and capital spending are transacted in us dollars 
the expenses and capital spending of our two international subsidiaries are transacted in the respective country s local currency and subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our foreign currency transactions are translated into us dollars at prevailing rates 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in current period income or loss as incurred 
currently  all material transactions are denominated in us dollars  and we have not entered into any material transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies
