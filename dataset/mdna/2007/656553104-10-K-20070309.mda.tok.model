risk factors in evaluating us as a company  careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors  in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  operating results and or financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
in addition to the following disclosures  please refer to the other information contained in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
we operate in a in the highly competitive ems electronic manufacturing services industry 
we compete against many ems companies 
the larger global competitors have more resources and greater economics of scale 
we also compete with oem in house operations that are continually evaluating manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing 
we may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers with excess capacity  lower cost structures and availability of lower cost labor 
the availability of excess manufacturing capacity of our competitors also creates competitive pressure on price and winning new business 
we must continue to provide services  a quality product  be responsive and flexible to customers requirements for design and technical support schedule changes and deliver 
our lack of execution could have an adverse effect on our operations 
a large percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers  and the loss of a major customer  if not replaced  would adversely affect us 
we have several customers that are responsible for a significant portion of our net sales 
general electric co 
s ge medical and transportation divisions together accounted for  and of net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  northrop grumman corp 
accounted for of net sales for the years ended december  and if there is a loss of one or more major customers or a significant decline in sales to our major customers it could have an adverse effect on our results from operations 
we will continue to expand our customer base through our in house sales efforts and target our acquisitions to reduce the dependence 
we are dependent on suppliers for electronic components and may experience shortages  cost premiums and shipment delays that would adversely affect our customers and us 
we purchase raw materials  commodities and components for use in our production 
increased costs of these materials could have an adverse effect on our production costs if we are unable to pass along price increases or reduce the other cost of goods produced through cost improvement initiatives 
fuel and energy cost increases could also adversely affect our freight and operating costs 
due to customer specifications and requirements  we are dependent on suppliers to provide critical electronic components and materials for our operations that could result in shortages of some of the electronic components need for their production 
component shortages may result in expedited freight  overtime premium and increased component costs 
in addition to the financial impact on operations from lost revenue and increased cost  there could potentially be harm to our customer relationships 
our customers cancel orders  change order quantity  timing and specifications and if not managed would have an adverse affect on inventory carrying costs 
we do face through the normal course of business excess and obsolete inventory losses as a result of customer order changes  cancellations  product changes and contract termination that could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we estimate and reserve for any known or potential impact from these possibilities 
the manufacture and sale of our products carries potential risk for product liability claims 
we represent and warrant the goods and services we deliver are free from defects in material and workmanship for one year from ship date 
unless otherwise agreed to  workmanship shall be in accordance with ipc and ansi j standards such as ipc a  class  ipc a  class  ansi j std  class  c we make no other guarantees or warranties  expressed or implied  of any nature whatsoever as to the goods including without limitation  warranties to merchantability  fit for a particular purpose or non infringement of patent or the like unless agreed upon in writing 
if a product liability claim results in our being liable and the amount is in excess of our insurance coverage or there is no insurance coverage for the claim then it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial position 
we depend heavily on our people and may from time to time have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees 
our operations depend upon the continued contributions of our key management  marketing  technical  financial  accounting  product development engineers  sales people and operational personnel 
we also believe that our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract  retain and develop highly skilled managerial and technical resources within the highly competition ems industry 
not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings 
operating in foreign countries expose our operations to risks that could adversely affect our operating results 
we ve operated a manufacturing facility in mexico since and we may in the future expand into other foreign countries 
the benefits projected for our mexico operation have taken more time then expected to integrate into our marketing strategies and our operation there is subject to risks  which could adversely impact our financial results such as economic or political volatility  employee turnover  staffing  managing personnel in diverse culture  labor instability  transportation delays  and foreign currency flux 
non compliance with environmental laws may result in restrictions and adverse effects on operations 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state  and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water  as well as the handling  storage  and disposal of such materials 
these laws and regulations include the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as well as analogous state and foreign laws and compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us because of our manufacturing processes and materials 
it is possible we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation at our sites and may have an adverse effect on operations 
we have not incurred significant costs related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations  and we believe that our operations comply with all applicable environmental laws 
environmental laws could also become more stringent over time  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation 
we operate in environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political  business  and environmental groups 
changes or restrictions on discharge limits  emissions levels  or material storage  handling  or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation 
it is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may be subject to risks associated with our acquisitions  and the risks could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our strategy is to grow our business organically and through acquisitions  alliances and joint venture arrangements 
we will continue to pursue and acquire additional businesses in the ems industry that fit our long term objectives for growth and profitability 
the success of our acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate the new operations with the existing operations 
in june  we acquired manufacturing assembly solutions of monterrey  inc mas  a mexican corporation  located in monterrey  mexico 
the benefits of this acquisition has taken more time then expected to integrate into our marketing strategies 
in february  we purchased a printed circuit board operation in garner  iowa with the expectation that the results will be accretive to the overall business 
if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated 
our revolving credit facility and debt agreements contain financial and operating covenants with which we must comply 
as of december   we were in compliance with each of these covenants 
however  among other factors  our continued compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results  which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors 
if we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to waive any future non compliance  we may be unable to borrow funds and any outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable  which could materially harm our business 
our business may be impacted by natural disasters 
tornadoes  blizzards and other natural disasters could negatively impact our business and supply chain 
in countries  which we rely on for operations and materials  such as mexico  china and thailand  potential natural disasters could disrupt our manufacturing operations  reduce demand for our customers products and increase supply chain costs

for additional financial data and by quarter information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a wayzata  minnesota based full service electronics manufacturing services ems contract manufacturer of wire and cable assemblies  printed circuit board assemblies  higher level assemblies and box builds for a wide range of industries 
markets served include industrial equipment  transportation  medical  military defense  computer  recreation and food 
in minnesota  we have facilities in baxter  bemidji  blue earth  fairmont and merrifield 
we also have facilities in augusta  wisconsin  garner  iowa and monterrey  mexico 
the vast majority of our revenue is derived from products that are built to the customer s design specifications 
we provide a high degree of manufacturing sophistication 
during  we continued our supply chain initiatives designed to reduce costs  improve asset utilization and increase responsiveness to customers 
our strategy has been to expand and diversify our customer base  and we are focusing our sales and marketing approach to target greater value added service opportunities 
our market strength is low volume  high mix production  particularly with complex products 
our investment in the mexico operation in allows for expansion into medium volume  medium mix and lower cost production and our contractual arrangements with chinese manufacturers allow us to meet high volume  low mix and lower cost customer requirements 
during  we experienced growth in our sales  gross profit  and net income 
for the years ended december  we had sales of million  compared to million for and million for the increase for of million was a improvement over for the years ended december   and  we had gross profit of million  million and million  respectively 
gross profits as a percentage of gross sales were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the modest gross profit increase in was attributed to volume leveraging in our operations and a favorable mix of products helping offset material and energy cost increases 
our net income in was  or per diluted common share compared to  or per diluted common share in our net income was  or per diluted common share 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require us to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  known trends in the industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to customers  when title has passed  all contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in the normal course of business we enter into a number of contracts with customers under which we provide engineering services on a per project basis 
revenue for these services is recognized upon completion of the engineering process  usually upon initial shipment of the product 
revenues from repair services are recognized upon shipment of related equipment to customers 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we analyze accounts receivable  historical write offs of bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we have not experienced significant bad debts expense and the reserve for uncollectible accounts of  is considered adequate for any exposure to loss in the december  accounts receivable 
inventory reserves inventory reserves are maintained for the estimated value of the inventory that may have a lower value than stated or quantities in excess of future production needs 
we have an evaluation process that is used to assess the value of the inventory that is slow moving  excess or obsolete on a quarterly basis 
we believe the total reserve of million at december  is adequate 
long lived and intangible asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
the evaluation is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the underlying assets 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to equal estimated fair value 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
the estimates associated with the asset impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes our estimate of the tax rates utilized in the calculation of the deferred tax balances is based on historical taxable income and expected future taxable income and corresponding rates 
further  our consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is based upon estimates of taxable income in future periods and future realizability of these assets 
self insured health claim accruals we estimate our reserve for employee health claims based on health claims incurred  historical lag times and an analysis of claims activity during the period  while taking into consideration insurance limits and coverage 
we believe the total accrual of  at december  is adequate 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment on january  sfas r requires us to measure and recognize in our consolidated statements of operations the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense to be recognized for each option award 
there are several assumptions that must be made when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends to be paid and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and the expected future performance of our stock 
an increase in the volatility of our stock price or an increase in the average period before exercise will increase the amount of compensation expense related to awards granted after december  based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair presentation of our financial position 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in materials costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
no matters have come to our attention since december  that would cause the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements to change materially

the decrease in selling expenses in from as a percentage of sales was a result of lower commission rates and lower commissionable sales and an reduction in spending in marketing and sales related expenses 
general and administrative for the years ended december   and  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million in from is mainly attributed to the increased employee related expenses of approximately million to support the growth and services  and the recognition of approximately million of stock based compensation expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million in from is attributable to the increased investment in infrastructure and employee related expenses  comprised primarily of million to support the growth and consolidation of corporate shared services

recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the securities exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires that public companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements 
this dual approach includes both an income statement focused assessment and a balance sheet focused assessment 
the guidance in sab must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to us gaap guidance requiring use of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements

the th amendment funded the iowa acquisition on february  the line of credit and other installment debt with wfb contain certain covenants  which  among other things  require us to adhere to regular reporting requirements  abide by annual shareholder dividend limitations  maintain certain financial ratios  and limit the amount of annual capital expenditures 
the availability under the line is subject to borrowing base requirements  and advances are at the discretion of the lender 
the line is secured by substantially all of our assets 
this commitment is summarized as described below other commercial commitment total amount committed outstanding at december  date of expiration line of credit april  as of december  and prior to the th amendment  we have net unused availability under our line of credit agreement of approximately million 
on december   we had working capital of approximately million as compared to million at the end of during  we generated approximately million of cash flow from operating activities 
the cash flow from operations is due primarily to net income of million and noncash depreciation  amortization  foreign currency transaction loss  and the change in deferred taxes  which totaled million in net positive adjustments 
the most significant impact on cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities was the use of cash to pay income taxes  which was offset  in part  by increases in accrued payroll and commissions 
our net cash used in investing activities of million primarily consisted of million spent on a building we purchased on june   in blue earth  minnesota  million on equipment purchases  million on building additions and improvements million of cash restricted for the future purchase of fixed assets at our new blue earth facility 
net cash provided by financing activities of million consisted primarily of drawing million on our line of credit along with increases in long term debt of million from the equipment note and million from the industrial revenue bond for the blue earth  mn facility purchase  and issuance of shares of common stock of million  which was offset by the decrease in our checks in excess of our bank balance of million  payments of long term debt of million and payments of bond issue costs million 
set forth below is information about our long term contractual obligations outstanding as of december  as adjusted for the long term liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of the garner  iowa operation on february  it brings together data for easy reference from the consolidated balance sheet and from individual notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this information is important in understanding our financial position 
payments due by period less than yr yrs yrs future bank note payable long term debt operating leases equipment purchase commitments total contractual obligations from time to time  we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
any significant losses implicit in those contracts will be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   no such losses existed 
we believe that our existing resources and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused  for example  by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate and unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the mexican peso 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
our financial advisors  both internal and external  provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect management s assessment 
exchange rate sensitivity we conduct operations in mexico 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates 
we do not use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the mexico subsidiary s local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of the subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
we do not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on earnings 
interest rate sensitivity the effective interest rate on our credit facilities are influenced by the actions of the federal reserve in establishing from time to time the federal funds interest rate which is the rate banks borrow from the federal reserve bank 
during the latter half of and throughout and  the federal reserve has been increasing the federal funds interest rate  causing the effective interest rate on our facilities to increase 
based on the balance outstanding under our interest bearing facilities at year end  a percentage point change in the effective interest rate would change interest expense by less than  annually
