we do not undertake to update any such forward looking statements and expressly disclaim any duty to update the information contained in this filing except as required by law 
unless the context otherwise requires  all references to the company  we  us  our  spectrum and spectrum pharmaceuticals refer to spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc and its subsidiaries  as a consolidated entity 
we primarily conduct all our activities as spectrum pharmaceuticals 

table of contents part i item business overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that acquires and advances a diversified portfolio of drug candidates  with a focus on oncology  urology and other critical health challenges for which there are few other treatment options 
our expertise lies in identifying undervalued drugs with demonstrated safety and efficacy  and adding value through further clinical development and selection of the most viable and low risk methods of commercialization 
we currently have ten drugs in development  including five in late stage clinical development 
we expect to have two drugs approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and to begin two registrational phase clinical trials in  or soon thereafter 
additionally  we expect to launch another drug in the pillars of our risk reduced business model are reduce scientific and clinical risk as much as is commercially viable by developing a broad and diverse pipeline with a late stage focus with emphasis on known mechanisms of action  utilize organizational  collaborative  scientific and commercial efficiencies from a therapeutic focus on oncology and urology  finance the development of our proprietary pipeline with multiple sources of financing  not just equity  and build and maintain a team with significant drug development experience  in other words  a team that has done it before 
our strategy allows us the opportunity to build a diversified portfolio of drugs  strengthen our development and commercialization capabilities  while sharing risk through business alliances and leveraging near term revenue opportunities 
our commitment is to build a successful commercial biopharmaceutical company with sustainable future growth from revenue generating prescription drugs in oncology and urology 
since august  we have accomplished a successful turnaround by shifting our strategic focus from drug discovery  neurology drugs and genomics research  to development of a diversified drug portfolio containing primarily clinical stage oncology  or anti cancer  drugs 
during this period  we have enhanced our financial strength and capabilities by securing over million in equity financing and upfront license fees  and entering into several strategic business alliances 
these actions enabled us to acquire development rights to several new proprietary drug product candidates  strengthen our management team  enhance our developmental and regulatory capabilities  and accelerate the development timelines of our key drug product candidates 
business strategy our mission at spectrum pharmaceuticals is to bring our expertise and passion for excellence to acquire  develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals for unmet medical needs while building value for our shareholders 
our business model is unique in that it is tightly focused to reduce risk and improve our odds of success 
the tenets of our business strategy to fulfill this mission are reduce scientific and clinical risk we take a portfolio approach to managing our pipeline that balances the size of the market opportunities with clear and defined clinical and regulatory paths to approval 
we acquire and develop multiple novel  late stage oncology product candidates that address niche markets 
each of these work differently and are based on diverse technologies just like the physicians and patients that we serve  we are not constrained by any one technology 
a late stage focus helps us effectively manage the high cost of drug development by focusing on compounds that have already passed the many costly hurdles in the pre clinical and clinical process 
executing on our portfolio strategy  we currently have ten drugs in development  including five in late stage clinical development 
we expect to have two drugs approved by the fda and to begin two registrational phase clinical trials in additionally  we expect to launch an additional drug in finally  while we continue to advance our existing product portfolio  we are evaluating additional promising proprietary drugs for acquisition or in licensing from third parties 
realize efficiencies from therapeutic focus our model allows us to leverage organizational  collaborative  commercial and scientific efficiencies from a therapeutic focus on oncology  and a near term commercialization 
table of contents focus on urology 
our model lets us pursue promising technologies without tying up our resources on unpromising candidates 
if we participate in the us co promotion of satraplatin  our lead drug  in prostate cancer  it will serve as a platform to introduce eoquin for non invasive bladder cancer and ozarelix for benign prostate hypertrophy  or bph  because all of these diseases are treated by urologists 
finally  our therapeutic concentration allows us to focus our business development efforts to better cover the depth and breadth of the scientific and commercial communities in our relevant areas of focus to find appropriate drug candidates for acquisition or in license 
non dilutive funding we plan to continue financing a portion of the development of our proprietary pipeline with multiple sources of financing  such as various collaborations  partnering and co development arrangements  and near term revenue opportunities like with our generics collaboration with par pharmaceutical companies  inc  or par in order to reduce the need for dilution to our shareholders from equity offerings 
strategic alliances to mitigate risks inherent in the drug development process  to accelerate drug development timelines  and to opportunistically generate cash  we will seek to out license rights to certain of our intellectual property and proprietary products for the development and commercialization of those products  particularly outside the united states  in exchange for upfront fees  milestones  royalties and other commercialization privileges 
near term revenues recognizing that new drug development is a lengthy process  we focus primarily on late stage proprietary compounds with the potential for generating revenues in the near term 
our current near term revenue drivers are satraplatin  expected to be launched in  or soon thereafter  if approved by the fda  and levofolinic acid  or lfa  and sumatriptan injection  the generic form of imitrex injection 
in addition  as eoquin and ozarelix are poised to commence phase trials in  we may  at the appropriate time  seek partners to provide us with upfront licensing fees  milestone payments and royalties on sales for ex north american rights to the development and commercialization of these drugs 
product commercialization as our drugs progress through development  to the point of potential fda approval for marketing in the united states  we plan to expand our sales and marketing capability 
however  the costs of establishing and maintaining a sales force to effectively market proprietary drug products in the united states are significant 
accordingly  to accelerate the market penetration of our proprietary products  when approved by the fda  we may seek collaborations with entities with proven sales  marketing and distribution capabilities in the united states 
experienced team we have built the foundation of a team with significant experience in oncology drug development 
we endeavor to leverage the talents of our team and add people who have relevant experience 
members of our team have been responsible for the development of drugs such as adriamycin  cisplatin  carboplatin  paclitaxel  doxorubicin  etoposide  buspar  nefazodone and stadol  among others 
we also plan to bring commercialization experience to the company as our products obtain fda approval 
recent developments in december  we announced that the patent litigation relating to sumatriptan injection  the generic version of glaxosmithkline s  or gsk  imitrex injection  had been dismissed by the united states district court for the district of delaware pursuant to a settlement agreement between us and gsk 
the terms of the confidential agreement provide that we may exclusively distribute authorized generic versions of certain sumatriptan injection products in the united states with an expected launch during gsk s sumatriptan pediatric exclusivity period that begins on august   but with the launch occurring not later than november  we will launch sumatriptan injection products through our partner for the sale and distribution of the drug  par  with whom we entered into a strategic alliance with in february this will enable par to continue with the launch of sumatriptan injection products ahead of gsk s patent expiration and allow us to begin receiving profits upon sales as early as pursuant to the agreement with par  as amended  we received a million payment from par related to sumatriptan injection for  which our abbreviated new drug application  or anda  was granted tentative approval by the fda in october 
table of contents in january  the fda accepted our investigational new drug  or ind  application for ozarelix in bph and also approved the protocol for a phase b study of ozarelix for the treatment of bph 
the phase b study is a randomized  placebo controlled trial of ozarelix involving approximately men suffering from bph 
in this trial  the men will be dosed with mg of ozarelix or placebo on day and day and will be followed for at least twelve weeks for assessing efficacy 
the study will evaluate safety and assess the clinical efficacy of ozarelix as a treatment for bph 
the primary endpoint of the study will be the improvement of bph symptoms as measured by the international prostate symptom score  or ipss  the standard method of assessing bph symptoms 
the study will also measure urine flow  residual urine volume and quality of life 
this study is currently underway with nearly half of the targeted patients enrolled 
data from this trial is expected to be available in the second half of we anticipate commencing a phase clinical trial in bph before the end of  or soon thereafter 
safety and efficacy data from this trial will be used to support a nda for ozarelix 
in february  we announced the completion of the new drug application  or nda  submission  with the fda for satraplatin  an orally bioavailable platinum compound  for use in combination with prednisone as a second line chemotherapy treatment for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer  or hrpc 
if the fda approves the nda  sales of satraplatin could commence in the united states as early as late  or early in  we in licensed worldwide rights to satraplatin from johnson matthey  plc  or johnson matthey 
in  in exchange for an upfront license fee and future milestones and royalties  we entered into a co development and license agreement with gpc biotech ag  or gpc biotech  for worldwide rights for further development and commercialization of satraplatin 
under the terms of this agreement  gpc biotech agreed to fully fund the development expenses for satraplatin 
in december  gpc biotech licensed commercialization rights for europe  turkey  the middle east  australia and new zealand to pharmion corporation  who expects to submit for european marketing authorization in the first half of  pending concurrence with the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products  or emea  the fda s european counterpart 
a successful worldwide launch of satraplatin and achievement of all regulatory and sales milestone revenues could generate revenues in excess of million for us  net of our milestone payment obligations to johnson matthey 
in addition  we will receive a royalty on worldwide sales of satraplatin  reduced by royalties payable by us to johnson matthey 
also  under certain conditions  we may have co promotion rights for satraplatin in the us as of the date of this report  we are in arbitration with gpc biotech over a contractual dispute  which arbitration is described in further detail at item legal proceedings of this report 
we recently reached an agreement with the fda for a special protocol assessment  or spa  procedure for a phase study for treatment of non invasive bladder with eoquin 
the spa process allows for a written agreement between us and the fda on the design of a study  including clinical drug supply  pivotal trial design  clinical endpoints  conduct  data analysis  and other clinical trial issues  and is intended to provide assurance that if pre specified trial results are achieved  they may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of a nda 
the spa calls for randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase clinical trials  each with patients with tagg non invasive bladder cancer 
patients will be randomized in a one to one ratio to eoquin or placebo 
the primary endpoint will be a statistically significant difference p in the rate of tumor recurrence at year two between the eoquin patient group and the placebo group 
we currently anticipate enrollment of the first patients in the united states trial in the second quarter of drug product candidates new drug development  which is the process whereby drug product candidates are tested for the purpose of filing a nda or similar filing in other countries and eventually obtaining marketing approval from the fda or a marketing authorization from other regulatory authorities outside of the united states  is an inherently uncertain  lengthy and expensive process which requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda in the united states  and regulatory authorities in other countries  that the products are both safe and effective for their respective indications 
our strategy is designed to address the significant risks of drug development by focusing our acquisition and development efforts on clinical stage drug candidates those in human trials 
we do  however  also undertake the acquisition and development of promising pre clinical drug candidates when we believe that the therapy is novel and or when we believe the drug candidates have a higher probability of regulatory approval than that of a typical compound at a similar stage of development 

table of contents our drug candidates  their target indications  and status of development are summarized in the following table  and discussed below in further detail drug candidate target indication development status satraplatin hormone refractory prostate cancer nda submitted february in multiple trials in other cancer types  in combination with radiation therapy  and in combination with other chemotherapies phase s levofolinic acid  or lfa high dose methotrexate rescue in osteogenic sarcoma nda on file with fda  chemistry  manufacturing and controls  or cmc  responses pending colorectal cancer planned regulatory filing sumatriptan injection migraines generic form of gsk s imitrex injection anda with paragraph iv filed  litigation settled  launch expected in the second half of eoquin non invasive bladder cancer phase completed  spa negotiated with fda  phase to start in the first half of ozarelix benign prostatic hypertrophy phase b initiated first quarter of  phase safety study to initiate by late hormone dependent prostate cancer phase study completed in  phase b study in progress in europe endometriosis phase study in second half of elsamitrucin various potential cancers phase lucanthone radiation sensitizer for gliobastoma multiforme and other brain tumors and brain metastases phase expected to initiate in second half of spi adjunct to chemotherapy pre clinical renazorb hyperphosphatemia in end stage renal disease pre clinical spi chemotherapy induced neuropathy pre clinical while other indications have not yet been identified  some of our drug candidates may prove to be beneficial in additional disease indications as we continue to study and develop these drug candidates 
in addition  we have intellectual property rights to neurology compounds that we may out license to third parties for further development 
we believe our drug candidates have the potential to be effective therapeutic agents with some advantages over existing therapies 
our goal is to develop and commercialize many of these drugs in the united states and license the rights for japan and europe to local companies in those countries to the extent that we have rights in those territories 

table of contents overview of major indications we are targeting cancer cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states  accounting for approximately of all deaths 
in its most recent annual report  the american cancer society reported that in the under age group  cancer is the leading cause of death 
in the united states  approximately million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in and over  persons are expected to die from the disease in accordingly  there is significant demand for improved and novel cancer treatments 
cancer occurs when abnormal cells divide without control 
these cells can invade nearby tissues or spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body 
five to ten percent of all cancers are believed to be due to inheriting a faulty gene 
the remaining to percent are believed to be caused by damage to the genes during a person s lifetime 
this damage can be caused by internal agents  such as hormones or an altered immune system  or external agents  such as viruses  exposure to chemicals or harmful ultraviolet sunrays 
sometimes ten or more years may pass between exposure and cancer detection 
cancer is currently treated by surgery  chemotherapy  radiation therapy  hormonal therapy and immunotherapy 
cancer is referred to as refractory when it has not responded or is no longer responding to a treatment 
we believe that traditional chemotherapeutic agents are likely to remain the mainstay therapy for cancer for the foreseeable future 
however  we continue to seek additional novel drugs  drug delivery methods and combination therapies that address cancer or cancer related indications with significant unmet medical need 
accordingly  we are actively seeking novel and proprietary oncology drug candidates that have demonstrated initial safety and efficacy in clinical trials and or we believe have a higher probability of regulatory approval than that of a typical compound at a similar stage of development  target cancer indications with significant unmet medical need  where current treatments either do not exist or are not effective  and we believe we can acquire at a fair value based on our judgment of clinical and commercial potential 
benign prostatic hypertrophy bph is a non cancerous enlargement of the prostate leading to difficulty in passing urine  reduced flow of urine  discomfort or pain while passing urine and increased frequency of urination 
enlargement of the prostate is caused by testosterone 
according to urology today  benign prostatic hypertrophy affects more than of men over age and as many as of men over the age of treatment options for benign prostatic hypertrophy include surgery and medications to reduce the amount of tissue and increase the flow of urine 
our drug candidates satraplatin satraplatin  an orally administered platinum derived chemotherapy agent  is being developed by our co development partner  gpc biotech ag  as a second line chemotherapy treatment for its intended initial indication  hormone refractory prostate cancer  or hrpc 
in addition to hormone refractory prostate cancer  satraplatin has shown indication of anti tumor activity in clinical studies in solid tumors such as ovarian and lung cancer 
prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the us and europe 
according to the american cancer society  approximately  men in the us are expected to be diagnosed with the disease in and over  men are expected to die from the disease 
in the european union  over  new cases are expected to be diagnosed  and over  patients are expected to die each year 
since the incidence of prostate cancer 
table of contents increases with age  the aging of the overall population is expected to further increase the number of prostate cancer patients 
most patients diagnosed with prostate cancer initially receive surgery or radiation therapy  and some of these patients are cured 
for many others  however  the disease recurs 
at this point  the recurrent disease is treated with hormone therapy  and most patients initially respond well to this treatment 
eventually  however  the tumor cells become resistant to the hormones or hormone refractory and the tumor again progresses 
increasingly  chemotherapy is being used as an effective first line treatment for hormone refractory prostate cancer 
however  it is not a cure  and so this is creating a need for effective therapeutic options for these patients once they have progressed 
platinum compounds continue to represent one of the most widely used classes of chemotherapeutic agents in modern cancer therapy and are typically used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of various types of cancer 
while the platinum compounds currently on the market are intravenously administered  satraplatin is an orally administered compound 
we believe an orally administered platinum derived chemotherapeutic agent may offer important clinical and commercial advantages over platinum compounds that need to be intravenously administered in a hospital setting  including ease of administration and patient convenience 
a pivotal phase trial  the satraplatin and prednisone against refractory cancer  or sparc  trial for satraplatin in hrpc  was initiated by our partner  gpc biotech  in september  following completion of a spa 
in september  the independent data monitoring board for the trial announced positive results from the sparc trial 
in february  an nda was submitted to the fda 
in february  the emea  the fda s european counterpart  issued a scientific advice letter enabling the pivotal phase trial on satraplatin to proceed in europe using the sparc protocol 
in december  gpc biotech licensed commercialization rights for europe  turkey  the middle east  australia and new zealand to pharmion corporation  who expects to submit for european marketing authorization in the first half of  pending concurrence with the emea 
satraplatin has demonstrated anti tumor activity in several cancers in clinical studies  accordingly  in order to maximize its potential  in addition to the sparc trial in hrpc  satraplatin is being studied in multiple trials in other cancer types  in combination with radiation therapy and in combination with other chemotherapies 
the following describes the commercial terms relating to satraplatin licensing and development 
in  we in licensed exclusive worldwide rights to satraplatin from its developer  johnson matthey  plc  or johnson matthey  in exchange for an upfront fee  additional payments to be made based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties based on any net sales  if any  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 
the term of the agreement expires on a country by country basis upon the expiration of the last to expire patents granted in each country  although some obligations  such as provisions relating to confidentiality  survive termination 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated earlier by johnson matthey if we fail to make any milestone or royalty payments on the date due  by us at any time upon sixty days notice  or by either party upon breach of the agreement or commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the other 
we paid to johnson matthey  upon submission of the complete nda filing in february and are required to pay  upon acceptance of the nda by the fda 
each of our contingent future cash payment milestone obligations to johnson matthey is generally matched by a corresponding  greater milestone receivable from gpc biotech see below 

table of contents in  in exchange for an upfront license fee and future milestones and royalties  we entered into a co development and license agreement with gpc biotech for worldwide rights for further development and commercialization of satraplatin 
under the terms of this agreement  gpc biotech agreed to fully fund the development expenses for satraplatin 
in december  gpc biotech licensed commercialization rights for europe  turkey  the middle east  australia and new zealand to pharmion corporation 
to date  we have received  in milestone payments and  in commissions on the sale of satraplatin product to gpc biotech 
in addition  during  pursuant to the license agreement  gpc biotech made an equity investment of  to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
on february   we announced that the rolling submission of the nda for satraplatin was submitted to the fda was completed 
the fda s acceptance of the nda will trigger a million milestone payment to us 
we are entitled to additional revenues upon achievement of specified milestones by gpc biotech and pharmion  which are generally based on developmental  regulatory events and sales and milestones  and royalties on worldwide sales  if any  of the product 
the term of the agreement expires on a product by product and country by country basis upon the expiration of the last to expire patents granted in each country covering such product  although some obligations  such as provisions relating to confidentiality and indemnification  survive termination 
in addition  the license agreement may be terminated earlier by either party in some cases either in whole or on a product by product and or country by country basis  based upon material breach or the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the other  or by gpc biotech upon six months notice to us 
we are in arbitration with gpc biotech over a contractual dispute  which arbitration is described in further detail at item legal proceedings of this report 
levofolinic acid  or lfa in april  we completed the acquisition of all of the oncology drug assets of targent  inc the principal asset in the transaction was a license agreement to market levofolinic acid  or lfa  also known as levoleucovorin  in the field of oncology in north america 
lfa is the pure active isomer of leucovorin calcium  a component of standard of care fluorouracil  or fu  containing regimens for the treatment of colorectal cancer and other malignancies 
leucovorin calcium is also used after the administration of high dose methotrexate in treating osteogenic sarcoma 
an nda for lfa has been filed with the fda for the osteosarcoma indication 
we expect to respond in the first half of this year to chemistry and manufacturing questions raised by the fda during the review of the application and hope to have the nda approved before the end of the year 
after receiving approval of the nda  we plan to file a supplemental nda for the colorectal cancer indication 
we are also contemplating a combination study with capecitabine this year 
lfa is currently marketed and sold by wyeth  sanofi aventis inc and others in certain parts of the world  including europe and japan 
in april  we completed the acquisition of all of the oncology drug product assets of targent  and agreed to issue to targent  or its stockholders  an aggregate amount of  shares of our common stock at closing 
only one third  of these shares will be registered for resale 
the remaining two thirds  shares will not be registered and therefore will be subject to restrictions on resale under rule under the securities act of  or the securities act 
in addition  targent is eligible to receive payments  in the form of our common stock and or cash  upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones  if any 
at our option  any amounts due in cash under the purchase agreement may be paid by issuing shares of our common stock having a value  determined as provided in the purchase agreement  equal to the cash payment amount 
in may  we amended and restated a license agreement with merck eprova ag  a swiss corporation  or eprova  that we assumed in connection with the acquisition of the assets of targent  inc pursuant to the license agreement  we obtained the exclusive license to use regulatory filings related to lfa and a non exclusive license under certain patents and know how related to lfa to develop  make  have made  use  sell and have sold lfa in the field of oncology in north america 
also  we have the right of first opportunity to negotiate an exclusive license to manufacture  have manufactured  use and sell lfa products outside the field of oncology in north america 
under the terms of the license agreement  eprova is eligible to receive payments upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones  in addition to royalties on potential net sales  if any 
the term of the license agreement is determined on a product by product and country by country basis until royalties are no longer owed under the license agreement 
in may  we also entered into a manufacturing and supply with eprova  whereby eprova shall manufacture calcium levofolinate the active pharmaceutical ingredient of lfa for us 
the manufacturing and supply agreement shall remain in force as long as we are obligated to pay royalty payments to eprova under certain sections of the license agreement 
after a certain period of time  we have the ability to use a third party to manufacture the product at a lower price  provided eprova has the opportunity to meet the competitive offer price 

table of contents sumatriptan injection in october  we filed an anda  with paragraph iv certification  with the fda  for gsk s sumatriptan injection  the generic form of gsk s imitrex injection 
in february  gsk commenced suit against us  alleging that the filing of our anda infringes their patent covering imitrex 
in december  we announced that the litigation had been dismissed by the united states district court for the district of delaware pursuant to a settlement agreement between gsk and us 
the terms of the confidential agreement provide that we may exclusively distribute authorized generic versions of certain sumatriptan injection products in the united states with an expected launch during gsk s sumatriptan pediatric exclusivity period that begins on august   but with the launch occurring not later than november  we will launch sumatriptan injection through our partner  par  for the sale and distribution of the drug 
this will enable par to continue with the launch of sumatriptan injection ahead of gsk s patent expiration and allow us to begin receiving profits upon sales as early as pursuant to the terms of our agreement with par  we will receive a majority of the profits from the sale of sumatriptan injection 
eoquin eoquin is an anti cancer agent that becomes activated by certain enzymes present in higher amounts in cancer cells than in normal cells 
it is currently being developed for the treatment of non invasive bladder cancer  which is cancer that has not invaded the muscle of the bladder wall 
eoquin is the trademarked name for the drug substance apaziquone formulated for administration directly into the urinary bladder intravesical instillation 
the american cancer society estimates that there will be more than  new cases of and  deaths from bladder cancer in in the united states 
the estimated patient population with bladder cancer is over  in the united states and even greater in europe 
non invasive bladder cancer accounts for to percent of all cases of bladder cancer at first diagnosis 
the initial treatment of this cancer is surgical removal of the tumor 
because of the high frequency of early recurrences of the tumor  patients are usually prescribed additional therapy to prevent or delay such recurrences 
this additional therapy generally consists of immunotherapy or chemotherapy drugs instilled directly into the bladder 
during the past years no new drugs have been introduced in the market for treatment of non invasive bladder cancer 
eoquin is activated to a greater degree within tumor cells than in the normal bladder lining 
also  it is not absorbed in any detectable significant amount from the bladder wall into the bloodstream and thus carries a lesser risk of systemic side effects 
during  we completed a multi center phase clinical trial to evaluate the level of anti tumor activity of eoquin as well as the safety of treatment 
phase data has confirmed anti tumor activity against recurrent multiple non invasive bladder cancer  as evidenced by thirty one of forty six patients showing a complete response after receiving six weekly treatments with eoquin instilled into the urinary bladder 
in clinical trials performed to date  eoquin has shown to be well tolerated  with no significant systemic toxicity  and local toxicity limited to temporary chemical cystitis inflammation of the urinary bladder resulting in increased urinary frequency  dysuria painful urination and hematuria blood in the urine in a few patients 
in addition  there was no adverse effect on wound healing when administered immediately after surgery 
in september  we initiated a multicenter clinical study in europe  of eoquin in high risk non invasive bladder cancer patients who risk early relapse  sometimes in the form of invasive  life threatening stages of bladder cancer 
enrollment is over half complete 

table of contents in march  we filed an ind for eoquin with the fda to begin a phase registration study for the treatment of non invasive bladder cancer 
subsequent to the filing and a meeting with the fda  we began a patient pilot safety study  for which patient accrual was recently completed 
in this study  eoquin was fund to be well tolerated when administered to patients immediately following surgery for non invasive bladder cancer in clinical results to date 
in addition  there was no adverse effect on wound healing and was not absorbed into the bloodstream 
we recently reached an agreement with the fda for a spa procedure for a phase study for treatment non invasive bladder 
the spa calls for randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase clinical trials  each with patients with tagg non invasive bladder cancer 
patients will be randomized in a one to one ratio to eoquin or placebo 
the primary endpoint will be a statistically significant difference p in the rate of tumor recurrence at year two between the eoquin patient group and the placebo group 
we currently anticipate enrollment of the first patients in the united states trial in the second quarter of the following describes the commercial terms relating to eoquin licensing and development 
in  we in licensed exclusive worldwide rights to eoquin and numerous related derivates from the inc research  formerly nddo research foundation  in the netherlands  in exchange for an up front fee  additional payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and a royalty based on net sales  if any  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 
the term of the agreement expires when all patents that are the subject of the license in the agreement expire  although some obligations survive termination 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated earlier by us upon three months notice to inc research 
the specific consequences of termination under each scenario are provided in the agreement that has been filed with the sec 
ozarelix ozarelix  a lhrh luteinizing hormone releasing hormone  also known as gnrh or gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist a substance that blocks the effects of a natural hormone found in the body is currently being evaluated for its targeted indications in hdpc  bph and endometriosis 
mechanistically  lhrh antagonists exert rapid inhibition of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone with an accompanying rapid decrease in sex hormones and would therefore be expected to be effective in a variety of hormonally dependent disease states including ovarian cancer  prostate cancer  bph  infertility  uterine myoma and endometriosis 
bph is a non cancerous enlargement of the prostate that is caused by testosterone 
unlike lhrh like drugs agonists  ozarelix  which is an antagonist of lhrh  has the potential to reduce testosterone just enough to reduce both prostate size and symptoms without the severe side effects associated with a reduction in testosterone 
current therapies for bph either address its symptoms but not the underlying condition  or block growth of new prostate cells and reduce prostate size with only moderate relief of symptoms 
there are two classes of drugs to treat bph 
the first  alpha adrenergic receptor blockers  are believed to work by relaxing the smooth muscle in the urethra and bladder without addressing the underlying condition of the enlarged prostate 
drugs in the second category  alpha reductase inhibitors  work by blocking production of the hormones that stimulate the growth of new prostate cells thereby stopping and eventually reversing enlargement of the prostate 
this class of drugs has a slow onset of action  typically requiring daily treatment for many months before improving patient symptoms 
drugs in both classes can have significant side effects  including decreased libido  impotence  abnormal ejaculation  rhinitis and cardiovascular effects such as dizziness  fainting and lightheadedness 
many patients ultimately fail existing medical therapy  leading to over  surgical procedures annually in the united states  despite the risks of serious surgical complications including impotence and incontinence 
we believe that ozarelix could provide rapid relief of the symptoms of bph 
phase data with ozarelix in patients with bph had very positive results 
highly statistically significant p and clinically meaningful results were seen for the primary endpoint in favor of ozarelix 
clinical improvement was maintained for six months following initial dosing of ozarelix 
ozarelix was safe and well tolerated 

table of contents in january  the fda accepted our ind application for ozarelix in bph  and also approved the protocol for a phase b study of ozarelix for the treatment of bph 
the phase b study is a randomized  placebo controlled trial of ozarelix involving approximately men suffering from bph 
in this trial  the men will be dosed with mg of ozarelix or placebo on day and day and will be followed for efficacy for at least twelve weeks 
the study will evaluate safety and assess the clinical efficacy of ozarelix as a treatment for bph 
the primary endpoint of the study will be the improvement of bph symptoms as measured by the ipss 
the study will also measure urine flow  residual urine volume and quality of life 
this study is currently underway with nearly half of the targeted patients enrolled as of the date of this report 
data from this trial is expected to be available in the second half of safety and efficacy data from this trial will be used to support an nda for ozarelix 
we anticipate commencing a phase clinical trial in bph in  or soon thereafter 
as described earlier  in connection with satraplatin  the initial treatment of prostate cancer includes surgery along with radiation therapy and hormonal therapy 
we believe ozarelix may prove to be an important addition in treating hormone dependent prostate cancer patients because of its ability to induce prolonged testosterone suppression in healthy volunteers as shown in early trials 
there are other lhrh antagonist and agonists a substance that mimics the effects of a natural hormone found in the body that are currently marketed or are being tested for the treatment of the indications we are pursuing 
however  we believe that ozarelix may have certain advantages over other lhrh antagonists which include improved solubility  less tendency for aggregation resulting in greater bioavailability absorption by the body and minimal histamine release tendency which should reduce allergic reactions 
we also believe that ozarelix has advantages over lhrh agonists which include immediate and dose dependent suppression of sex hormones and no risk of testosterone surge or clinical flare up which are currently clinically important and may be more important in the future as intermittent dosing strategies are being studied 
phase data for ozarelix in hormone dependent prostate cancer appears to be positive 
patients receiving mg per cycle of ozarelix showed the greatest continuous testosterone suppression  the primary endpoint 
in patients with continuous testosterone suppression  tumor response  as measured by psa levels  was 
ozarelix was well tolerated at all doses 
a phase trial  conducted by our licensor of the drug  zentaris gmbh  a subsidiary of aeterna zentaris  inc is ongoing in europe 
we believe that data from this trial will be available late  or soon thereafter 
endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus is also found elsewhere in the body  but mainly in the abdominal cavity 
this condition typically affects women during their menstruating years and is rarely found after menopause 
currently  there is no cure for endometriosis 
however  symptoms associated with endometriosis can be managed through a combination of treatments 
in endometriosis  we are completing the preclinical studies reproductive toxicology studies required before initiating studies in female subjects 
the phase study is expected to initiate in the second half of 
table of contents the following describes the commercial terms relating to ozarelix licensing and development 
in  we entered into a license agreement with a subsidiary of aeterna zentaris  zentaris gmbh  or aeterna zentaris  whereby we acquired an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ozarelix in north america including canada and mexico and india 
in addition  we have a financial interest in any income aeterna zentaris derives from ozarelix in japan 
with certain exceptions  we are required to purchase all finished drug product from aeterna zentaris for the clinical development of ozarelix at a set price 
we paid an up front fee  and are contingently obligated to pay additional amounts based upon achievement of milestones and a royalty based on any future net sales 
during  upon the successful conclusion of the phase trials in  we paid to aeterna zentaris a milestone payment of one million euros approximately million 
also  during  aeterna zentaris entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with nippon kayaku co 
ltd 
of japan for the development and marketing of ozarelix for all potential oncological indications in japan  and received an upfront payment and is eligible to receive payments upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones  in addition to low double digit royalties on potential net sales 
under the terms of our license agreement with aeterna zentaris  we are entitled to receive fifty percent of the upfront and milestone payments and royalties received from nippon kayaku co 
ltd 
by aeterna zentaris 
as of december   our share of the upfront payments received by aeterna zentaris in was recorded as deferred income and will be recorded as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  namely when we have no significant future performance obligations and collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured 
in this regard  the payment of our non refundable fifty percent  was received in january in the event zentaris  or another licensee  independently develops ozarelix for territories not licensed to us  we are entitled to receive and utilize the results of those development efforts 
with certain exceptions  we are required to purchase all finished drug product from zentaris for the clinical development of ozarelix at a set price 
the parties agreed to discuss entering into a joint supply agreement for commercial supplies of finished drug product 
the term of the license agreement expires ten years after the first commercial sale of a product in any country within the territory or as long as any product is covered by a patent in any country in the territory  whichever term is longer  although some obligations survive termination 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated earlier by either party in some cases either in whole or on a product by product and or country by country and or indication by indication basis  based upon material breach or the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the other  or by us upon sixty days notice to zentaris 
the specific consequences of termination under each scenario are provided in the agreement that has been filed with the sec 
elsamitrucin elsamitrucin is an anti tumor antibiotic that acts as a dual inhibitor of two key enzymes involved in dna replication  topoisomerase i and ii 
by inhibiting the activity of these two key enzymes involved in dna replication  elsamitrucin is thought to lead to dna breaks that prevent the correct replication of dna and ultimately result in cancer cell death 
in april  we initiated a multi center  phase trial in patients with refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma 
this trial was completed in the fourth quarter of and final results are expected in the first half of preliminary results suggest limited efficacy of elsamitrucin given as a single agent in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma 
in experimental models  elsamitrucin appeared to have synergy with paclitaxel and platinum derivatives 
we plan to initiate soon a phase study of elsamitrucin in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with recurrent or advanced non small cell lung cancer 
the rationale for this  in addition to the above mentioned synergism  is that elsamitrucin has been shown in clinical studies to result in minimal toxicity to bone marrow  the main toxicity target of most anticancer agents  therefore  it may allow combinations with other drugs without a need to significantly reduce doses  which may result in improved therapeutic effects 
we in licensed exclusive worldwide rights to elsamitrucin from its developer  bristol myers squibb  in  in exchange for an upfront fee  additional payments based upon achievement of milestones and a royalty based on net sales  if any  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 
lucanthone lucanthone is an orally administered small molecule which inhibits topoisomerase ii and interferes with the repair of dna damage that is caused by radiation 
specificity of lucanthone in combination with radiation for the treatment of brain tumors arises from the fact that lucanthone acts preferentially on cycling cells most of the normal brain cells are non cycling and the fact that lucanthone crosses the blood brain barrier efficiently 
lucanthone was originally used as an antiparasitic agent for the treatment of schistosomiasis in the s and s  and has a demonstrated safety profile 
it was later discontinued because better antiparasitic medications became available 
a phase study is planned for the treatment of brain tumors and brain metastases in we plan to initiate a phase study for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme  a form of brain cancer 

table of contents in may  we entered into a license agreement with dr 
robert e 
bases  the inventor of a method of treating cancer of the central nervous system through the administration of lucanthone and radiation  whereby we acquired worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize a product based upon his invention 
under the terms of the agreement  we made a small upfront payment to dr 
bases and we are obligated to make additional periodic payments  a payment upon achievement of a certain regulatory milestone and royalties on potential net sales  if any 
spi spi is a highly selective peptide agonist of endothelin b receptors  which can stimulate receptors on endothelial cells  the innermost layer of cells lining the blood vessels 
this technology takes advantage of the fact that the blood supply to tumors is different than the blood supply to healthy organs 
blood vessels in the growing part of tumors are relatively devoid of smooth muscle covering and are rich in endothelial cells 
therefore  by stimulating the endothelial b receptors present on the endothelial cells  spi should selectively increase tumor blood flow while sparing healthy tissue 
chemotherapy is one of the mainstays of therapy for solid carcinomas  including breast  lung  and prostate 
chemotherapy uses drugs called cytotoxic agents that are poisonous to cells and kill cancer cells 
chemotherapy often fails because adequate and uniform distribution of the cytotoxic agents is not achieved in the tumor  and serious side effects can result from toxicity to normal cells 
consequently  any means to increase the delivery of a cytotoxic agent selectively to tumors  while minimizing its concentration in normal tissues may be very beneficial 
spi is being developed as an adjunct to chemotherapy 
in pre clinical studies  when anti cancer drugs  such as paclitaxel injection  are administered shortly after spi  the anti cancer drug concentration in the tumor is increased several fold 
this results in increased antitumor efficacy at a given dose of a cytotoxic agent  and might allow physicians to maximize efficacy with reduced cytotoxic agent doses with resultant decreased toxicity to the normal organs 
we are currently completing the pre clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies for spi required to file an ind  which we expect to do in subsequent to that  we plan to initiate a phase i study 
the following describes the commercial terms relating to spi licensing and development 
in february  we entered into a license agreement with chicago labs  inc  whereby we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize spi for the prevention and treatment of cancer 
we paid chicago labs an upfront fee of  and we are obligated to make future payments contingent upon the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones 
in addition we will pay royalties and sales milestones on net sales  if any  after marketing approval is obtained from the fda and other regulatory authorities 
chicago labs may terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain development deadlines that may be extended by chicago labs upon our request if we demonstrate good faith efforts to meet the deadlines 
renazorb renazorb  a second generation lanthanum based nanoparticle phosphate binding agent  has the potential to address hyperphosphatemia  or high phosphate levels in blood  in patients with end stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease 
hyperphosphatemia  or high phosphate levels in blood  affects patients with chronic kidney disease  especially end stage kidney disease patients on dialysis 
it can lead to significant bone disease including pain and fractures and cardiovascular disease  and is independently associated with increased mortality 
according to the united states renal data system s annual report and the national kidney foundation  there are an estimated  patients with end stage renal disease in the united states 
during the past decade  the end stage renal disease population is estimated to have grown by approximately annually 
treatment of hyperphosphatemia is aimed at lowering blood phosphate levels by restricting dietary phosphorus intake  and using  on a daily basis  and with each meal  oral phosphate binding drugs that facilitate fecal elimination of dietary phosphate before its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream 
restricting dietary phosphorus intake has historically not been a successful means of serum phosphate control  and phosphate binders are the mainstay of hyperphosphatemia management 

table of contents currently marketed therapies for treating hyperphosphatemia include non calcium  non aluminum  non magnesium phosphate binders such as polymer based and lanthanum based phosphate binders  aluminum based phosphate binders  and calcium based phosphate binders 
under the new national kidney foundation k doqi guidelines  both calcium based phosphate binders and non calcium  non aluminum  non magnesium phosphate binders are recommended as first line or long term therapy for the management of hyperphosphatemia 
however  the current therapies require use of a large number of pills or large pills to be chewed or swallowed along with each meal  leading to problems with patient compliance with the treatment regime 
we believe that renazorb has the opportunity  because of its potentially higher capacity for binding phosphate on an equal weight basis  to significantly improve patient compliance by offering the lowest in class dosage potentially one or two small tablets per meal to achieve the same therapeutic benefit as other phosphate binders 
we continue to perform preclinical development work on renazorb 
spi spi  a lipid suspension of leteprinim  has demonstrated  in experimental models  benefits in treating chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy 
chemotherapy drugs can damage the nervous system  especially the peripheral nervous system which are those nerves that carry motor movement information for muscle contraction and those that carry sensory information such as touch  vibration  pain and temperature 
damage to the peripheral nerves is known as neuropathy 
currently  there is no effective treatment for chemotherapy induced neuropathy 
during  we plan to continue preclinical evaluation of spi generic drugs the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of created an anda approval process to accelerate the approval of generic drugs and foster generic competition 
in the expectation of a growing us market for generic drugs  we filed several andas with the fda  including those for sumatriptan injection  as discussed above  and for ciprofloxacin tablets  fluconazole tablets  atenolol tablets  and carboplatin injection  which have received fda approval 
we are currently evaluating the potential economic value of these drugs 
business alliances strategic business alliances are an important part of the execution of our business strategy 
we currently do not own any manufacturing or distribution capabilities 
we generally direct and pay for all aspects of the drug development process  and consequently incur the risks and rewards of drug development  which is an inherently uncertain process 
to mitigate such risks and address our manufacturing and distribution needs  we enter into alliances where we believe our partners can provide strategic advantage in the development  manufacturing or distribution of our drugs 
in such situations  the alliance partners may share in the risks and rewards of the drug development and commercialization 
we have entered into product development and manufacturing  and sales  marketing and distribution alliances for some of our drug candidates and intend to enter into additional alliances in the future 
key product development and manufacturing alliances are described elsewhere in this report along with the product descriptions 

table of contents sales  marketing and distribution with the exception of the distribution of the authorized generic versions of gsk s imitrex injection  expected to be launch by par on our behalf in  we do not currently have any exclusive distribution arrangements 
based on the progress of our drug candidates through the development and regulatory process  especially lfa and satraplatin  both of which may be approved by the fda this year  we may hire sales and marketing personnel  as needs dictate 
we may also seek alliances with other third parties to assist us in the marketing and sale of our proprietary drug candidates 
competition the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving biotechnology and intense competition 
we expect biotechnological developments and improvements in the fields of our business to continue to occur at a rapid rate and  as a result  expect competition to remain intense 
many companies are engaged in research and development of compounds that are similar to our research 
biotechnologies under development by these and other pharmaceutical companies could result in treatments for the diseases and disorders for which we are developing our own treatments 
in the event that one or more of those programs are successful  the market for some of our drug candidates could be reduced or eliminated 
any product for which we obtain fda approval must also compete for market acceptance and market share 
competition for proprietary products competing in the branded product business requires us to identify and quickly bring to market new products embodying therapeutic innovations 
successful marketing of branded products depends primarily on the ability to communicate the effectiveness  safety and value of the products to healthcare professionals in private practice  group practices  hospitals and academic institutions  and managed care organizations 
competition for branded drugs is less driven by price and is more focused on innovation in treatment of disease  advanced drug delivery and specific clinical benefits over competitive drug therapies 
unless our proprietary products are shown to have a better safety profile  efficacy and are as cost effective  if not more cost effective  than other alternatives  they may not gain acceptance by medical professionals and may therefore never be successful commercially 
companies that have products on the market or in research and development that target the same indications as our products target include ardana bioscience  astra zeneca lp  amgen  inc  bayer ag  bioniche life sciences inc  eli lilly and co  novartis pharmaceuticals corporation  ferring pharmaceuticals  neorx corporation  genentech  inc  bristol myers squibb company  glaxosmithkline  biogen idec pharmaceuticals  inc  osi pharmaceuticals  inc  cephalon  inc  sanofi aventis inc  pfizer  inc  avi biopharma  inc  genta inc  genzyme corporation  imclone systems incorporated  mgi pharma  inc  millennium pharmaceuticals  supergen  inc  shire pharmaceuticals  tap pharmaceuticals  inc  qlt inc  threshold pharmaceuticals  inc  roche pharmaceuticals  schering plough  johnson johnson and others who may be more advanced in development of competing drug candidates or are more established and are currently marketing products for the treatment of various indications that our drug candidates target 
many of our competitors are large and well capitalized companies focusing on a wide range of diseases and drug indications  and have substantially greater financial  research and development  marketing  human and other resources than we do 
furthermore  large pharmaceutical companies have significantly more experience than we do in pre clinical testing  human clinical trials and regulatory approval procedures  among other things 
competition for generic products the generic drug market is extremely price competitive and revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic drug products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors 
as patents and regulatory exclusivity for brand name products expire  if a generic manufacturer has first to file status as described below under paragraph iv certification or has an authorized generic  such generic manufacturer generally enjoys a period of exclusivity with respect to other manufacturers of the generic drug  and can achieve significant market penetration 
however  as competing generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products  market share  revenues and gross profit typically decline  in some cases  dramatically 
accordingly  the level of market share  revenues and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product is normally related to the number of competitors in that product s market and the timing of that product s regulatory 
table of contents approval and launch  in relation to competing approvals and launches 
we have observed significant price declines in the marketplace for each of our marketed products  due to the fda s approval of several competing andas  and the resultant glut of product introduced on and after the generic product launch dates 
we have recorded only modest revenues to date from generic product sales  due primarily to our late entry into the market for each of our approved generic drugs 
we are unable at this time to reliably estimate recurring revenues or profits from these generic products in the foreseeable future 
in addition to competition from other generic drug manufacturers  we face competition from brand name companies in the generic market 
many of these companies seek to participate in sales of generic products by  among other things  collaborating with other generic pharmaceutical companies through authorized generic programs or by marketing their own generic equivalent to their branded products 
companies that have a significant generic presence include abraxis biosciences  inc  bedford laboratories  mayne  barr laboratories  teva pharmaceuticals  par pharmaceuticals companies  dr

research and development research and development expenses are comprised of the following types of costs incurred in performing research and development activities personnel expenses  facility costs  contract services  license fees and milestone payments  costs of clinical trials  laboratory supplies and drug products  and allocations of corporate costs 
research and development expenditures  including related stock based charges  are expensed as we incur them and were approximately million in  million in  and million in as follows years ended december  amounts in thousands ozarelix eqquin lfa spi elsamitrucin other proprietary drugs generic anda development total direct costs indirect costs subtotal add stock based charges non cash total research development patents and proprietary rights our patents  proprietary rights and andas we in license from third parties certain patent and related intellectual property rights related to our proprietary products 
in particular  we have licensed patent rights with respect to satraplatin  lfa  eoquin  elsamitrucin  ozarelix  lucanthone  renazorb and spi  in each case for the remaining life of the applicable patents 
except for ozarelix and lfa  our agreements generally provide us with exclusive worldwide rights to  among other things  develop  sublicense  and sell the drug candidates 
under these license arrangements  we are generally responsible for 
table of contents all development  patent filing and maintenance costs  sales  marketing and liability insurance costs related to the drug candidates 
in addition  these licenses and agreements may require us to make royalty and other payments and to reasonably exploit the underlying technology of applicable patents 
if we fail to comply with these and other terms in these licenses and agreements  we could lose the underlying rights to one or more of our potential products  which would adversely affect our product development and harm our business 
the protection  preservation and infringement free commercial exploitation of these patents and related intellectual property rights is very important to the successful execution of our proprietary drug strategy 
however  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity nor as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent 
accordingly  our patents and the patents we have in licensed may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents 
if our patent applications are not approved or  even if approved  if our patents or the patents we have in licensed  are circumvented or not upheld by the courts  our ability to competitively exploit our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced 
also  such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors  in which case our ability to commercially exploit these products may be diminished 
from time to time  we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop  manufacture and market our products 
if we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  our ability to commercially exploit such products may be inhibited or prevented 
as mentioned above  we have in licensed from third parties certain patent rights related to our proprietary products 
we believe that our patents and licenses are important to our business  but that with the exception of the united states and european patents discussed in this paragraph  relating to our proprietary products  no one patent or license is currently of material importance to our business 
there are two united states patents covering satraplatin  a compound patent that expires in and a medical use patent that expires in  and an issued compound patent in europe that expires in various countries between and there is a possibility  under the hatch waxman act  to obtain up to a year extension of one of the united states patents for the time spent during the fda regulatory process 
there are similar extension possibilities in europe 
for lfa  we have one united states patent that covers lfa for use in methotrexate rescue that expires in and one united states patent that covers lfa for use in conjunction with fluorouracil for the treatment of colorectal cancer that expires in as with satraplatin  there is the possibility of a patent term extension 
for eoquin  there is a compound patent that expires in in the united states and in various countries in europe in we have filed and will file additional patent applications covering new formulations and or uses for this product 
for elsamitrucin  the united states and europe patents have already expired  however  we have filed a united states method of use patent application and we anticipate filing future united states and european patent applications covering new formulations and or uses for this product 
for ozarelix  there is a united states compound patent issued that will expire in and a method of use patent application is on file in the united states 
for lucanthone  there is a united states method of use patent that expires in for renazorb  there are patents comprising compositions of matter directed a treating hyperphosphatemia pending in the united states and europe 
for spi  we have filed method of use patent applications in the united states and europe 
for spi  there is a united states compound patent that expires in and united states method of use patent that expires in the united states compound patent s foreign counterpart in europe expires in various countries in we are constantly evaluating our patent portfolio and are currently prosecuting patent applications for our drug products and are considering new patent applications in order to maximize the life cycle of each of our products 
while the united states and the european union are currently the largest potential markets for most of our proprietary product candidates  we also have patents issued and patent applications pending outside of the united states and europe 
limitations on patent protection in these countries  and the differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in countries outside the united states  may limit the protection we have on patents issued or licensed to us outside of the united states 
in addition  laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as would laws in the united states 
to minimize our costs and expenses and to maintain effective protection  we usually focus our patent and licensing activities within the united states  the european union  canada and japan 
in determining whether or not to seek a patent or to license any patent in a certain foreign country  we weigh the relevant costs and benefits  and consider  among other things  the market potential and profitability  the scope of patent protection afforded by the law of the jurisdiction and its enforceability  and the nature of terms with any potential licensees 
failure to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary drugs and technology would impair our ability to be commercially competitive in these markets 

table of contents in addition to the specific intellectual property subjects discussed above  we have trademark protection for eoquin and renazorb 
we will likely register trademarks for the branded names of our proprietary drug products if any are approved for marketing 
in conducting our business generally  we rely upon trade secrets  know how  and licensing arrangements and use customary practices for the protection of our confidential and proprietary information such as confidentiality agreements 
it is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance  and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
it is also possible that our trade secrets or know how will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
the protection of know how is particularly important because the know how is often the necessary or useful information that allows us to practice the claims in the patents related to our proprietary product candidates 
we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation concerning patents  trademarks  copyrights and proprietary technologies can often be protracted and expensive and  as with litigation generally  the outcome is inherently uncertain

in connection with andas filed on behalf of jb chemicals pharmaceuticals ltd  or jbcpl  and fdc  ltd  we have the exclusive license to market and distribute those drugs within the united states  if and when approved by the fda 
we own the andas for carboplatin  sumatriptan succinate injection and our other andas 
the patent process the united states constitution provides congress with the authority to provide inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries 
congress codified this right in united states code title  which gave the us patent and trademark office  or uspto  the right to grant patents to inventors and defined the process for securing a united states patent 
this process involves the filing of a patent application that teaches a person having ordinary skill in the respective art how to make and use the invention in clear and concise terms 
the invention must be novel not previously known and non obvious not an obvious extension of what is already known 
the patent application concludes with a series of claims that specifically describe the subject matter that the patent applicant considers his invention 
the uspto undertakes an examination process that can take from one to five years  or more  depending on the complexity of the patent and the problems encountered during examination 
generally  the less novel an invention is  the longer the examination process will last 
in exchange for disclosing the invention to the public  the successful patent applicant is provided a right to exclude others from making  using or selling the claimed invention for a period of years from the effective filing date of the patent application 
under certain circumstances  a patent term may be extended 
patent extensions are most frequently granted in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries under the drug price competition and pricing term restoration act of  or commonly known as the hatch waxman act  to recover some of the time lost during the fda regulatory process  subject to a number of limitations and exceptions 
the patent term may be extended up to a maximum of five years  however  as a general rule  the average extension period granted for a new drug is approximately three years and approximately months for a new medical device 
only one patent can be extended per fda approved product  and a patent can only be extended once 
regulatory exclusivities the fda has provided for certain regulatory exclusivities for products whereby the fda will not approve of the sale of any generic form of the drug until the end of the prescribed period 
the fda will grant a year period of exclusivity for a product that contains a chemical entity never previously approved by the fda either alone or in combination with other drugs 
in addition  the fda will grant a year period of exclusivity to a new drug product 
table of contents that contains the same active drug substance that has been previously approved such as a new formulation of an old drug product 
also  as an incentive for pharmaceutical companies to research the safety and efficacy of their brand name drugs for use in pediatric populations  congress enacted the food drug administration modernization act of  which included a pediatric exclusivity for brand name drugs 
this pediatric exclusivity protects drug products from generic competition for six months after their patents expire in exchange for research on children 
for example  if a pharmaceutical company owns a patent covering a brand name drug they can only exclude third parties from selling generic versions of that drug until that patent expires 
however  if the fda grants a brand named drug pediatric exclusivity the fda will not approve a generic drug company s anda and thus not allow the sale of a generic drug for six months beyond the patent term covering the brand name drug 
thus  the pediatric exclusivity effectively extends the brand named company s patent protection for six months 
this extension applies to all dosage forms and uses that the original patent covered 
paragraph iv certification in  congress enacted the hatch waxman act in part to establish a streamlined approval process for the fda to use in approving generic versions of previously approved branded drugs 
under the hatch waxman act  for each patent listed in the fda orange book  where branded companies are required to list their patents for branded products  for the relevant branded drug  an anda applicant must certify one of the following claims that there is no patent information listed  that such patent has expired  that the proposed drug will not be marketed until expiration of the patent  or that either the proposed generic drug does not infringe the patent or the patent is invalid  otherwise known as paragraph iv certification 
if an anda applicant files a paragraph iv certification  the hatch waxman act requires the applicant to provide the patent holder with notice of that certification and provides the patent holder with a day window  during which it may bring suit against the applicant for patent infringement 
if patent litigation is initiated during this period  the fda may not approve the anda until the earlier of months from the patent holder s receipt of the notice the month stay or the issuance of a final  non appealed  or non appealable court decision finding the patent invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
if the patent is found to be infringed by the filing of the anda  the patent holder could seek an injunction to block the launch of the generic product until the patent expires 
often more than one company will file an anda that includes a paragraph iv certification 
however  the hatch waxman act provides that such subsequent anda applications will not be approved until days after the earlier of the date of the first commercial marketing of the first filed anda applicant s generic drug or the date of a decision of a court in an action holding the relevant patent invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
thus  the hatch waxman act effectively grants the first filed anda holder days of marketing exclusivity for the generic product

orphan drug designation some jurisdictions  including europe and the united states  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
the fda grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the united states or more than  individuals in the united states and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the united states a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the united states for that drug 
in the united states  orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and approval process 
if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity  which means the fda may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years  except in limited circumstances  such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity 
also  competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity 

table of contents under european union medicines laws  criteria for designation as an orphan medicine are similar but somewhat different from those in the united states 
orphan medicines are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity  except under certain limited circumstances comparable to united states law 
during this period of market exclusivity  no similar product  whether or not supported by full safety and efficacy data  will be approved unless a second applicant can establish that its product is safer  more effective or otherwise clinically superior 
this period may be reduced to six years if the conditions that originally justified orphan designation change or the sponsor makes excessive profits 
our drug product lfa has been granted orphan drug designations for its use in conjunction with high dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma and for its use in combination chemotherapy with the approved agent fluorouracil in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer 
governmental regulation the production and marketing of our proprietary and generic drug products are subject to regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  drugs are subject to rigorous regulation 
the federal food  drug and cosmetics act  as amended from time to time  and the regulations promulgated there under  as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our proposed products 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework  including for drugs already at a clinical stage of development  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with  and approved by  the fda 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to regular inspections by the fda and must comply with good manufacturing practices  or cgmps 
to supply products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturing establishments must also comply with cgmps and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by regulatory authorities in certain of such countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
general information about the drug approval process the united states system of new drug approval is one of the most rigorous in the world 
only a small percentage of compounds that enter the pre clinical testing stage are ever approved for commercialization 
our strategy focuses on in licensing clinical stage drug candidates that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials 
this strategic focus on clinical stage drug candidates those eligible for human trials is designed to address certain risks of drug development by shortening the timeline to marketability and reducing the risk of failure  both of which are higher with an early stage product 
the following general comments about the drug approval process are relevant to the development activities we are undertaking with our proprietary drugs 
pre clinical testing during the pre clinical testing stage  laboratory and animal studies are conducted to show biological activity of a drug compound against the targeted disease and the compound is evaluated for safety 
investigational new drug application after pre clinical testing  an investigational new drug application is submitted to the fda to request the ability to begin human testing of the drug 
phase clinical trials after an investigational new drug application becomes effective  phase human clinical trials can begin 
these trials  typically involving small numbers of healthy volunteers or patients usually define a drug candidate s safety profile  including the safe dosage range 
phase clinical trials in phase clinical trials  studies of volunteer human patients with the targeted disease are conducted to assess the drug s effectiveness 
these studies are designed primarily to determine the appropriate dose levels  dose schedules and route s of administration  and to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug on humans  as well as to determine if there are any side effects on humans to expand the safety profile following phase 
table of contents phase clinical trials this phase usually involves large numbers of patients with the targeted disease 
during the phase clinical trials  physicians monitor the patients to determine the drug candidate s efficacy and to observe and report any adverse reactions that may result from long term use of the drug on a large  more widespread  patient population 
during the phase clinical trials  typically the drug candidate is compared to either a placebo or a standard treatment for the target disease 
new drug application after completion of all three clinical trial phases  if the data indicates that the drug is safe and effective  a new drug application is filed with the fda requesting fda approval to market the new drug as a treatment for the target disease 
fast track review the fda has established procedures for accelerating the approval of drugs to be marketed for serious life threatening diseases for which the manufacturer can demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
one of our drug candidates  satraplatin  has been given a fast track designation for the hormone refractory prostate cancer indication 
phase clinical trials after a drug has been approved by the fda  phase studies are conducted to explore additional patient populations  compare the drug to a competitor  or to further study the risks  benefits and optimal use of a drug 
these studies may be a requirement as a condition of the initial approval of the nda 
abbreviated new drug application  or anda an anda is the abbreviated review and approval process created by the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of signed into law in part for the accelerated approval of generic drugs 
when a company files an anda  it must make a patent certification if there are any patents covering the branded product listed in the fda s orange book 
an anda applicant must make one of four certifications that there is no patent information listed in the orange book  that the listed patent has expired  that the listed patent will expire on a stated date and the applicant will not market the product until the patent expires  or that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product 
the anda must also demonstrate both chemical equivalence and bio equivalence the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug in the body is substantially equivalent to the brand name product  unless a bio equivalence waiver is granted by the fda 
the anda drug development and approval process generally takes less time than the nda drug development and approval process since the anda process does not require new clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of the drug product 
approval if the fda approves the new drug application  the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe to patients for treatment 
the marketing of a drug after fda approval is subject to substantial continuing regulation by the fda  including regulation of adverse event reporting  manufacturing practices and the advertising and promotion of the drug 
failure to comply with fda and other governmental regulations can result in fines  unanticipated compliance expenditures  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of ndas  andas or other product applications enforcement actions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
although we have internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see item a risks factors our failure to comply with governmental regulation may delay or prevent approval of our product candidates and or subject us to penalties 
the generic drug enforcement act of established penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an anda 
under this act  the fda has the authority to permanently or temporarily bar companies or individuals from submitting or assisting in the submission of an anda  and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market generic drugs 
the fda may also suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct and or withdraw approval of an anda and seek civil penalties 
the fda can also significantly delay the approval of any pending nda  anda or other regulatory submissions under its fraud  untrue statements of material facts  bribery and illegal gratuities policy 

table of contents as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies  and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies 
the impact of this new requirement  and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers  is uncertain and could adversely affect our business 
continuing studies of the proper utilization  safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by industry  government agencies and others 
such studies  which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques  can call into question the utilization  safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted  and may in the future result  in the discontinuance of their marketing 
foreign regulation whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country  and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country 
under european union regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure which is available for medicines produced by biotechnology or which are highly innovative  provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
this authorization is a marketing authorization approval  or maa 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization  which is granted by a single european union member state  may submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the applications and assessment report  each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
this procedure is referred to as the mutual recognition procedure  or mrp 
in addition  regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the united states 
we face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to our collaborators or us 
third party reimbursement and pricing controls in the united states and elsewhere  sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers  such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
it will be time consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from medicare and private payers 
our products may not be considered cost effective  and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis 
the passage of the medicare prescription drug and modernization act of imposes new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs  which may affect the marketing of our products 
in many foreign markets  including the countries in the european union  pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control 
while we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and profitability
