you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expects  intends  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential  continues or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these risks and other factors include those listed under risk factors and elsewhere in this report

we will not update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statement is made 
critical accounting policies several of the company s accounting policies involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on the company s results of operations and financial position include the estimated collectibility of accounts receivable and the recovery value of obsolete or overstocked inventory 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped based on its terms of fob shipping point  where risk of loss and title transfers to the buyer at time of shipment 
the company records sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
under these guidelines  revenue is recognized when all of the following exist persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and payment is reasonably assured 
provisions are made currently for estimated product returns and sales allowances 
allowances for sales returns  doubtful accounts and other 
sales are recorded net of estimated future returns  uncollectible accounts receivable and other customer related allowances 
management analyzes historical returns and bad debt expense  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and sell through of our products when evaluating the adequacy of these allowances 
in addition  the company may provide warehousing credits and other allowances to certain customers in accordance with industry practice 
these reserves are determined based on historical experience  budgeted customer allowances and existing commitments to customers 
although management believes it has established adequate reserves with respect to these items  actual activity could vary from management s estimates and such variances could have a material impact on reported results 
inventory 
in its ordinary course of operations  the company generally makes some sales below its normal selling prices or below cost 
based on experience  management believes this will be true for some inventory held on or acquired after august  the amount of such sales depends on several factors  including general economic conditions  market conditions within the apparel industry  the desirability of the styles held in inventory and competitive pressures from other garment suppliers 
the company s inventory increased to million at august  from million at august   reflective of higher stock levels due to earlier receipt in the current year as compared to the prior year of pre sold goods held for shipments to customers in primarily september and october 
the company has established an inventory markdown reserve as of august   which management believes will be sufficient for current inventory that is expected to be sold below cost in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize its expected selling prices or that the inventory markdown reserve will be adequate for items in inventory as of august  for which customer sales orders have not yet been received 
the inventory markdown reserve is calculated based on specific identification of aged goods and styles that are slow moving or selling off price 
deferred taxes 
deferred taxes are determined  based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as the future benefit of any net operating loss carryforward  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are no longer amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
we performed an annual test during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year to determine if the recorded goodwill and intangible assets were impaired 
this process compared the fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets to their carrying values 
we concluded that for fiscal year  the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets exceeded the carrying values and no impairment charge was required 
the determination of whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgment based on long term and short term projections of future performance 
changes in strategy and or market conditions or if actual operating results or cash flows are different than our estimates and assumptions  may result in impairment charges in future periods 
stock based compensation 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r when we issued our first options in september under sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to these and new awards 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model for estimating the fair value of the stock based compensation granted 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in our opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options

impact of inflation and deflation management does not believe that inflation has had any material impact upon the company s revenues or income from operations to date 
management believes that the apparel sector in which the company operates continues to experience deflation  contrary to the modest inflation experienced in the economy in general 
the persistence of the consumer to buy on sale merchandise has put pressure on retail gross margins  which in turn has led to downward pressure from retailers on wholesale gross margins  in the form of lower negotiated purchase prices as well as selling cost adjustments taken as deductions against invoices issued by the company 
in the apparel industry  these selling cost adjustments are commonly referred to as markdown allowances or chargebacks 
without a corresponding decrease in fabric and labor prices  these markdown allowances have led to a decline in wholesale gross margins 
the company incurred million in markdown allowances in fiscal  as compared to  incurred in fiscal management believes these deflationary pressures will continue into the foreseeable future

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rates from our bank credit facility are based on cit s prime lending rate 
as such  future financings are subject to market risk 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our borrowings to changes in interest rates 
at august  we had million outstanding on our credit facility 
a change in interest rates under that credit facility would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately  foreign currency exchange rate risk while we purchased over of our products from foreign manufacturers in fiscal  all of our purchases are denominated in united states dollars 
because our products are sold primarily in the united states in dollar denominated transactions  we do not engage in currency hedging to reduce currency risk 
a prolonged increase in the value of the dollar versus foreign currencies could enhance our purchasing power for new purchase orders and reduce its cost of goods sold 
conversely  a prolonged decrease in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies could result in an increase in our cost of manufacturing for new purchase orders and costs of goods sold
