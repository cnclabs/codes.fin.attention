business model we began shipping our first product in january we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as oems  resellers and system integrators 
oems generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
fiscal year our total revenues for fiscal year were million  which were higher than our prior fiscal year revenues of million 
license revenues increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year we also experienced continued growth in our services revenues  which increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year these increases to overall revenues were primarily due to the introduction of new products associated with our acquisition of performancesoft in january  and a continued increase in new and repeat business from a number of global customers 
income from operations decreased from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year this decline in our operating margin was primarily due to million in stock based compensation recorded in fiscal year  as a result of our adoption of financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
r share based payment fas r 
this decrease was partially offset by the increases in revenues described above 

table of contents fiscal year during fiscal year  we expect three trends to continue to have significant impact on results of our operations 
we currently believe that corporate it budgets will grow only modestly in the fiscal year second  corporations were reluctant to buy software from new vendors and we continue to witness corporations consolidate their business intelligence  enterprise reporting software and performance management application purchases into fewer suppliers 
finally  we continue to experience vigorous competition in the enterprise reporting market 
several of our competitors have released products that are marketed to be directly competitive with our enterprise reporting application platform 
the existence of these competitive products required additional sales and marketing efforts to differentiate our products  which resulted in extended sales cycles 
we believe that competition in the enterprise reporting market will continue to be vigorous in the near future 
for  we will continue to pursue the strategic initiatives to improve revenue growth that we began introducing in as well as a new initiative related to performance management 
these initiatives are as follows selling to it management we are re focusing our sales efforts on selling our products to it managers who we believe generally recognize the technical advantages of our products 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue in the short term 
solution selling to line of business management we are creating software solutions to market to line of business managers 
these solutions are in the areas of financial management and customer self service reporting 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue over the medium to long term 
investing in birt we are continuing to make a significant investment in creating a new open source code reporting tool  known as birt 
we hope that birt will eventually become widely adopted by java developers and will create demand for our other commercially available products 
the birt project is a long term initiative 
selling to global corporations in the financial services sector we are continuing to focus on selling our products to global financial services companies in an effort to increase our substantive market share in this sector 
delivering a highly differentiated performance management offering we intend to combine performancesoft s leading performance management applications and actuate s enterprise reporting application platform to provide capabilities for distributing accountability throughout the enterprise 
as of december   we had full time employees  a net increase of employees  or  in our workforce reported as of december  during fiscal and we restructured our international operations and accounted for the restructuring charges in accordance with financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the amount of these costs recognized in fiscal and were approximately million and  respectively 
these cost primarily consisted of charges related to employee matters  estimated settlement costs stemming from employee litigation and idle facilities 
we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 

table of contents acquisitions on january   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of performancesoft 
performancesoft was a leading provider of performance management solutions software and services located in toronto  canada 
the results of operations of performancesoft and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the acquisition principally consisted of an initial purchase price of million and an additional payment of approximately million based on the achievement of certain revenue and operating margin targets for fiscal year and other adjustments 
the total purchase price for performancesoft was million 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  income taxes  restructuring  and litigation 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
actuate generates revenues from sales of software licenses and related services 
the company receives software license revenues from licensing its products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  system integrators and oems 
the company receives service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services and training that actuate performs for customers 
actuate recognizes revenues in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
for sales to end user customers  actuate recognizes license revenues when a license agreement has been signed by both parties or a definitive agreement has been received from the customer  the product has been shipped  there are no unusual uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
actuate has not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for its licenses 
therefore  the company recognizes revenues from arrangements with multiple elements involving software licenses under the residual method 
if the license agreement contains payment terms that would indicate that the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as the payments become due and payable  assuming that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
actuate enters into reseller and distributor arrangements that typically give such distributors and resellers the right to distribute its products to end users headquartered in specified territories 
actuate recognizes license revenues from arrangements with us resellers and distributors when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the reseller or distributor  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
actuate recognizes license revenues from arrangements with international resellers and distributors upon receipt of evidence of sell through and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if it is not practical to obtain evidence of sell through  the company defers revenues until the end user has been identified and cash has been received 
in some instances there is a timing difference between when a reseller completes its sale to the end user and the period in which actuate receives the documentation required 
table of contents for revenue recognition 
because actuate delays revenue recognition until the reporting period in which the required documentation is obtained  it may recognize revenue in a period subsequent to the period in which the reseller completes the sale to its end user 
actuate also enters into oem arrangements that provide for license fees based on the bundling or embedding of its products with the oems products 
these arrangements generally provide for fixed  irrevocable royalty payments 
actuate recognizes license fee revenues from us and international oem arrangements when a license agreement has been executed by both parties  the product has been shipped  there are no unusual uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
effective july   due to improved visibility with respect to international and oem sales transactions  we conformed our policy for sales through international oems to be consistent with us oem arrangements 
prior to this change  we deferred revenue on sales through international oems until we received a royalty report or other evidence of sell through from such oem  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria was met 
the impact of this change on revenue for fiscal year was not significant 
credit worthiness and collectibility for end users are assessed based on payment history and current credit profile 
when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenues are deferred and recognized upon cash receipt 
actuate recognizes maintenance revenues  which consist of fees for ongoing support and unspecified product updates  ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to standard implementation and configuration 
training revenues are generated from classes offered at the company s headquarters and customer locations 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the services are performed 
when a contract includes both  license and service elements  the license fee is typically recognized on delivery of the software  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the product and are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks 
our gross accounts receivable is reserved against this risk through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration a combination of factors 
we look at factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  and current economic conditions 
these factors are reviewed to determine whether a specific reserve for bad debt should be recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
we also cease recognizing future revenues on any outstanding domestic maintenance renewal invoices which are older than days past due 
we also record unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
a reserve percentage is applied to various aged categories of receivables based on historical experience to determine how much of an unspecified reserve is needed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted fas r using the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost was recognized based on the requirements of fas r for a all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
fas r requires the use of judgment and estimates in performing multiple calculations 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our estimate of volatility is based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price 
to the extent 
table of contents volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based compensation expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future  our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
our estimate of expected term of options granted is derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term  as described in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
in the future  as information regarding post vesting termination becomes more accessible  we may change our method of deriving the expected term 
this change could impact the fair value of our options granted in the future 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
sfas no 
requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
as a result of the cumulative losses we incurred in prior years  we previously concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded 
in  we determined that our recent experience of generating income  along with our projections of future us and foreign income  constituted significant positive evidence for a partial release of our valuation allowance 
therefore  we recorded a tax benefit related to a release of the valuation allowance on the portion of deferred tax assets expected to be realized over the succeeding two year period 
at future dates  if sufficient positive evidence exists that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized with respect to the remaining deferred tax assets  we will release additional valuation allowance 
this adjustment to the valuation allowance would decrease tax expense  reduce goodwill or intangibles or increase shareholder s equity in the period such a determination was made 
likewise  if there is a reduction in the projection of future us and foreign income  we may need to increase the valuation allowance 
any increase in the valuation allowance would increase tax expense  increase goodwill or intangibles or decrease shareholder s equity in the period such a determination was made 
contingencies 
we are or have been engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in litigation or settlement strategy for a particular matter 
accrual for restructuring charges 
during the fiscal years ended december   and  we incurred certain restructuring charges that were a combination of reductions in workforce  exits of idle 
table of contents facilities and write offs of fixed assets 
these restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred in connection with our restructuring plans 
these estimates were impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 
in fiscal year  we recorded a facility restructuring charge  which consisted of estimated future obligations for the non cancelable lease payments and estimated costs associated with subleasing the property 
we reduced the amount of the facility restructuring charge by the estimated amount of sublease income 
the assumptions we made  which we periodically re evaluate and adjust as appropriate  are based on estimates of such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublease the property and sublease rates 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to such factors as changes in property occupancy rates and the rental prices charged for comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges for exiting the idle facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined and would be recorded as a credit to restructuring charges 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional restructuring charge would be recorded and would have an unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
in process research and development 
we review our acquisitions to determine if there are any intangible assets relating to purchased in process research and development 
projects that have not achieved technological feasibility and have no alternative future use are valued at fair market value using a discounted cash flow analysis and are expensed in the statement of operations on the date of acquisition 
we use a discount rate that reflects the development stage of the technology and the risks associated with attaining full technological and commercial feasibility 
when we value in process research and development  we must make a number of estimates  including the timing and amounts of future cash flows to be generated as a result of the projects  how close the projects are to technological feasibility and how much risk and cost is involved in finalizing the projects 
it is reasonably likely that our estimates for these amounts will differ from actual results  in which case our in process research and development charge may be over or under valued  which would also result in an under or over valuation of our goodwill 
valuation of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  customer lists  non compete agreements  experienced workforce  and trademarks 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if the assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  we will reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
as of december  the net carrying amount of our intangible assets was million 
we evaluate goodwill at least annually for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
valuation of minority interest in actuate japan 
the minority shareholders of actuate japan have the option to put their equity interest minority interest in actuate japan and actuate has the option to call the minority interest 
in fiscal  a minority shareholder of actuate japan notified the company that it wished to exercise its right to put its equity interest in actuate japan and the company made a payment of approximately 
table of contents  for this interest 
this payment was recorded as additional goodwill related to actuate japan 
the remaining minority interest as of december  was approximately 
if the minority interest shareholder chose to put these remaining shares or actuate chose to call these remaining shares  actuate would be required to pay approximately  to purchase these shares 
as of the date of this filing  the remaining minority shareholder has not notified the company of any intent to exercise their put option  and accordingly  the company has not accounted for the potential exercise 
recovery of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recovery of its long lived assets periodically by analyzing its operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 
at some point in the future  we may determine that our long lived assets are impaired 
the timing of such impairment may result in charges to our statement of income to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge based on various assumptions and estimates 
assumptions and estimates about future values can be complex and are often subjective 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable  different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results

table of contents our revenues are derived from license fees and services  which include software maintenance and support  consulting  and training 
the increase in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to our acquisition of performance soft in january of fiscal  which accounted for approximately million  or of the increase 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to continued increase in new and repeat business from a number of global customers companies with annual revenues greater than billion and further expansion of our product and services into financial and government sectors  as well as a continued increase in the worldwide installed base of customers receiving ongoing support 
as a result of these positive trends  we experienced improvements in our license  maintenance and support revenues for a combined increase of or approximately million over the same period last year 
the increase in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a or approximately million increase in our maintenance revenue due to the impact of an aggressive support renewal pricing structure implemented in fiscal year and a continued increase in the worldwide installed base of customers receiving ongoing support 
these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately or million in our license and or  in our consulting services revenues 
we believe these decreases were primarily due to increased competition from other vendors in our market as well as several unusually large license deals signed in fiscal year license fees year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands the increase in license revenues for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to our acquisition of performancesoft  which added approximately million to license revenue in fiscal year additionally  during fiscal  we received an increased number of individual product license transactions in excess of million compared to fiscal also in fiscal we recognized million in license revenue resulting from the conclusion of a license royalty compliance issue that included license revenues pending since fiscal the decrease in license revenue  in both percentage and absolute dollar terms for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily seen in our north american region and was due to several interrelated factors  including i a depressed information technology spending environment for enterprise reporting solutions  ii difficulty in securing new customer accounts  iii continued competitive pressures  and iv fewer significant transactions  each individually in excess of million  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues for any of the periods presented

for the same period last year  north america accounted for approximately of the total license revenue while the europe and asia pacific regions accounted for and of the total license revenues  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenues  license fee revenues increased from in the fiscal year to in fiscal year the european region marked the highest growth in license revenue during fiscal year over fiscal this was due mainly to a significant agreement with a financial institution during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the decreases in license revenues in north america in fiscal as compared with fiscal year were primarily due to fewer large deals in excess of million in fiscal year in addition  the competitive environment in our market niche contributed to the decrease in domestic license revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal year license revenues derived from our indirect channel partners  including oems  systems integrators and resellers  accounted for  and of total revenues from license fees for fiscal years  and  respectively

the growth in services revenues for fiscal year was primarily attributed to the increase in our maintenance and support revenues of approximately or million  driven by a continued growth in our installed base of customers under maintenance plans and our continued implementation of an aggressive renewal campaign by our maintenance renewal group 
of the total increase in maintenance and support revenues  million was attributed to our acquisition of performancesoft in january consulting services revenues also increased by or million during fiscal year this increase was almost entirely due to the acquisition of performancesoft 
the steady increase in maintenance revenue from fiscal year to fiscal year was mainly attributed to the impact of the company s change in pricing structure of maintenance renewals introduced in fiscal year  as well as a larger installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support 
also in fiscal year  the company benefited from a concerted effort to increase maintenance renewals 
in contrast to prior years  in order to increase maintenance renewals  the company hired additional employees to head the effort of ensuring customers renew their maintenance agreements once the original maintenance contracts expire 
this effort was undertaken during the second quarter of fiscal and resulted in continued increase of maintenance and support revenue in both fiscal years and in fiscal our professional services revenues remained relatively consistent in all geographical regions with the levels experienced in fiscal we expect maintenance and services revenue to grow in fiscal year in absolute dollars as our installed base of customers under maintenance continues to grow

the decrease in cost of license fees for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to reduced compensation  printing and production related costs as well as a decrease in the amortization of the purchased technologies associated with the acquisition of tidestone and nimble which had been fully amortized in fiscal year cost of license fees further decreased due to the fact that we are no longer obligated to pay royalties to one of our main vendors as we acquired the rights to the underlying technology outright in the fourth quarter of fiscal year these decreases more than offset the increase in the amortization of acquired rights to the purchased intangibles derived from the performancesoft acquisition 
the decrease in cost of license fees in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in software license revenues resulting in approximately  reductions in third party royalties and  in production costs 
there was also a reduction of approximately  in the amortization of purchased technologies 
purchased technologies related to the tidestone acquisition became fully amortized in the second quarter of fiscal and accounted for approximately  of the decrease

this increase was primarily the result of a increase to our sales and marketing related headcount  which was driven mainly by the acquisition of performancesoft 
this increase was also a result of higher commissions driven by increased sales in fiscal year  as well as merit increases which were approved in the first quarter of the year

the increase in the amortization of other intangibles in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to the amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with our acquisition of performancesoft in january of fiscal year  offset by full amortization of other intangibles associated with our acquisitions of tidestone and nimble technology 
the decreases in amortization of other purchased intangibles in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due to the fact that we fully amortized the other intangibles associated with our acquisitions of tidestone and nimble technology by the second and third quarter of fiscal year  respectively 
in addition  during the second quarter of fiscal year  we offset approximately  of accrued liabilities from our purchase of nimble technology against purchased technologies as the contingencies that gave rise to the original accrued liability amounts were settled for an amount lower than originally estimated 
as there was no goodwill associated with the nimble acquisition  the reduction of accrued liabilities resulted in a decrease to unamortized purchased technologies during the second quarter of fiscal year we expect the estimated amortization expense of our existing other purchased intangible assets in fiscal to remain consistent with the levels experienced in fiscal purchased in process research and development during fiscal year and in connection with the acquisition of performancesoft  we recorded a charge to operations of  for purchased in process research and development 
this charge was recorded during the first quarter of fiscal year and was expensed because the research and development had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
the value of the purchased in process research and development was computed using the excess earnings approach analysis  which is based on the theory that all assets must contribute to the profitability of an enterprise 
we determined the valuation of the purchased in process research and development with the assistance of an independent third party 
restructuring charges year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands percent of total revenue during fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
this charge consisted of a million facility exit charge and million in costs related to the reduction of our worldwide workforce 

table of contents the facility exit charge was the result of a long term non cancelable lease agreement that we entered into during fiscal year  in anticipation of a projected business expansion 
during fiscal year  we decided to exit this facility  and entered into a sublease agreement with a new tenant 
we review our assumptions underlying the idle facilities accrual on a regular basis 
during fiscal year  the sublease was extended with the existing tenant 
as a result of this extension  some of the assumptions that were previously asserted changed and  accordingly  we revised and lowered the estimated exit costs by approximately  during fiscal and we restructured our international operations and accounted for the restructuring charges in accordance with financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the amount of these costs recognized in fiscal and were approximately million and  respectively  and primarily consisted of charges related to employee matters  estimated settlement costs stemming from employee litigation and idle facilities 
during fiscal year  we evaluated the consolidation of our facilities as a result of the performancesoft acquisition and determined that no additional facility related restructuring charge was required

table of contents interest and other income  net  are comprised primarily of interest income earned by us on our cash and short term investments  foreign currency exchange gains and losses  as well as other various charges or income which are not derived from our normal operations 
the increase for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to i higher weighted average interest rate on our investments which resulted in higher interest income in fiscal year  ii an increase of approximately million in operating cashflows which resulted in higher interest income in fiscal  offset by iii million in cash outlays related to our acquisition of performancesoft in january which served to decrease interest income 
in addition  we experienced an increase in the refund of investment tax credits related to our research and development operations in canada  and we incurred a  asset impairment charge in fiscal year the increase for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to improved returns on our cash and investments of  and currency exchange gains totaling  these increases were offset by a realized investment loss of  which we incurred in the second and third quarters of fiscal year  a one time grant of  received in the prior year and adjustments of approximately  in personnel and social taxes by our international subsidiaries 
the realized investment loss was associated with our investment in a company which we periodically evaluate 
in the second quarter of fiscal year we determined the value to be other than temporarily impaired and  accordingly  reduced the book value from  to approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  this company was acquired and we received approximately  in cash 
the remaining balance of approximately  was collected in october we expect interest and other income to remain within the same range in fiscal year due to the fact that we currently do not anticipate a significant cash outlay or a change in our investment strategy 
provision benefit for income taxes year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands the provision benefit for income taxes represents primarily federal  state and foreign taxes as adjusted for the impact of operating losses utilized  income tax credits and the reversal or establishment of reserves 
the provision benefit for income taxes of  million and  is based on pretax income of million  million  and million in fiscal years  and respectively 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million benefit from the decrease in the valuation allowance 
without this benefit  there would have been an increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to higher pre tax book income  utilization of option related deferred tax assets and the reversal of the fas r book expense which increases our book pre tax income when calculating taxable income 
the increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to higher pre tax book income 
in evaluating the company s ability to realize the net deferred tax asset  the company considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  including its past operating results  tax planning strategies and forecasts of future taxable income 
in considering these sources of taxable income  the company must make certain assumptions and judgments that are based on the plans and estimates used to manage its underlying business 
changes in the company s assumptions  plans and estimates may materially impact income tax expense 
in  we determined that our recent experience of generating income  along with our projections of future us and foreign income  constituted significant positive evidence for a partial release of our valuation allowance 
therefore  we recorded a tax benefit related to a release of the valuation allowance on the portion of deferred tax assets expected to be realized over the succeeding two year period 
as a result of this analysis  the 
table of contents company estimates that it will more likely than not be able to realize million of deferred tax assets 
consistent with this judgment  the company recorded a million tax benefit in for the reversal of the valuation allowance previously recorded against its net deferred tax assets

table of contents cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million used in fiscal the primary driver for this decrease was the acquisition of performancesoft  which resulted in a net cash payment of approximately million 
due to this acquisition  we liquidated our investments by a total of approximately million to accommodate the funding of this transaction 
in addition  during february  a minority shareholder of actuate japan notified us that it wished to exercise its rights to put its equity interest in actuate japan to us and as a result we paid approximately  for this minority interest during the first quarter of cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million used in fiscal cash used in investing activities remained relatively constant as purchases of property and equipment were unusually high in fiscal year due to the implementation of a new enterprise wide accounting software application 
this was offset by an increase in purchases of short term investments and a payment to a minority shareholder as a result of their exercise of a put option in fiscal year cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million used in fiscal this decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to the acquisition of nimble technology in july of fiscal year  offset by an increase in payments associated with the purchase of property and equipment in fiscal year which was due to the implementation of our new enterprise wide accounting software application 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million used in fiscal year the change in cash provided was primarily the result of the tax benefits realized from exercise of stock options and higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock to our employees  offset by lower level of stock repurchases 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to  used in fiscal  a change of million 
this increase in cash used was primarily the result of lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock in fiscal year  offset by an increased level of stock repurchases 
in fiscal year  we spent approximately million in cash to repurchase approximately million shares of common stock in the open market 
cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal year compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal year  a change of million 
this decrease was primarily the result of lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock in  offset by a lower level of stock repurchases in for fiscal year  we spent million in cash to repurchase approximately  shares of our common stock in the open market 
this use of cash was partially offset by proceeds derived from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans which totaled approximately million in fiscal year year ended december  in thousands  except share data number of shares repurchased cost of shares repurchased we believe that our current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may find it necessary to sell additional equity  draw down under our existing credit facility or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our current stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  including the acquisition of the minority interest in our owned subsidiary in japan  or complementary products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies

on january   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of performancesoft 
the acquisition principally consisted of an initial cash purchase price of million and additional contingent cash consideration of up to million based on the achievement of certain revenue and operating margin targets for fiscal year due to the fact that the contingent consideration was not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt at the time of acquisition  the company did not include this contingent consideration in the acquisition accounting at the date of acquisition 
rather  it was recorded when we were able to determine the estimated amount of the payout beyond a reasonable amount  which occurred in the fourth quarter of based on the criteria stipulated in the acquisition agreement  we determined that the earnout payment would be approximately million 
we recorded this additional consideration as additional cost of the acquired enterprise and this additional consideration was allocated to goodwill 
this additional consideration is expected to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal year in addition to the earnout payment  we also paid out  to the former shareholders based on the resolution of specific contingent items documented in the purchase agreement

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of credit risk  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange risk 
during the fiscal years  and we derived  and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales outside of north america 
we face exposure to market risk on these receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  transaction gains and losses may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
our gains due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations were approximately  in fiscal year compared to gains of approximately  during fiscal year and losses of approximately  in fiscal year interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in the general level of us interest rates the majority of our portfolio is invested in short term securities that have an average maturity of one year or less 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments in investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified by geography and no single customer has accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue on an annual basis 
we generally do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
