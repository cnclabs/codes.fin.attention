critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following are our critical accounting policies because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our consolidated results of operations 
we recognize revenue from the following major revenue sources long term fixed price contracts involving significant customization fixed price contracts involving minimal customization software licensing sales of computer hardware and identification media postcontract customer support pcs the company s revenue recognition policies are consistent with u 
s 
gaap including statements of position software revenue recognition and modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  emerging issues task force issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and emerging issues task force issue applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
accordingly  the company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts involving significant amount of hardware and software customization using the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs at completion 
revenue from contracts for which we cannot reliably estimate total costs or there are not significant amounts of customization are recognized upon completion 
determining when a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method involves judgment 
critical items that are considered in this process are the degree of customization and related labor hours necessary to complete the required work as well as ongoing estimates of the future labor hours needed to complete the contract 
we also generate non recurring revenue from the licensing of our software 
software license revenue is recognized upon the execution of a license agreement  upon deliverance  fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable and when all other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
we also generate revenue from the sale of computer hardware and identification media 
revenue for these items is recognized upon delivery of these products to the customer 
our revenue from periodic maintenance agreements is generally recognized ratably over the respective maintenance periods provided no significant obligations remain and collectibility of the related receivable is probable 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of allowance by analyzing historical losses  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  the age of the accounts receivable balances  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivables balance was  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  for the year ended december  valuation of goodwill  other intangible and long lived assets we assess impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based upon fair value methodologies 
goodwill and other net intangible assets amounted to approximately  for the year ended december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective  and as a result we ceased to amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we performed an initial impairment review of our goodwill in june  and will perform an annual impairment review thereafter in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
completion of our initial impairment test indicated there was no goodwill impairment 
we also performed our annual impairment review as of december   based upon our operating plan this annual impairment review indicated there was goodwill impairment in our digital photography segment as of december   and accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
both of these tests were conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
with the sale of our digital photography component in  we reassessed the composition of our operating segments and determined that we no longer operate in separate  distinct market segments but rather operate in one market segment  such segment being identity management 
the company s determination was based on fundamental changes in the company s business structure due to the consolidation of operations  restructuring of the company s operations and management team  and the integration of what where previously distinct  mutually exclusive technologies 
this has resulted in changes in the manner by which the company s chief decision maker assesses performance and makes decisions concerning resource allocation 
as a result of our operation in one market segment  such segment being identity management  our goodwill impairment review consisted of the comparison of the fair value of our identity management segment as determined by the quoted market prices of our common stock to the carrying amount of the segment 
as the fair value exceeded the carrying value by a substantial margin  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
there are many management assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss  and estimates using different  but reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 
significant assumptions include estimates of future levels of revenues and operating expenses 
therefore  the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future  if any  may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions 
there can be no assurance that goodwill impairment will not occur in the future 
we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount of fair value less costs to sell 
we recorded no impairment losses for long lived or intangible assets during the twelve months ended december  and in  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  related to our intangible asset for certain trademark and tradenames carried in our identification segment 
this loss reflects the amount by which the carrying value of this asset exceeded its estimated fair value determined by the assets future discounted cash flows 
the impairment loss is recorded as a component of operating expenses in the statement of operations for there are many management assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss  and estimates using different  but reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 
significant assumptions include estimates of future levels of revenues and operating expenses 
therefore  the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future  if any  may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions 
there can be no assurance that intangible asset impairment will not occur in the future 
stock based compensation upon adoption of sfas r on january   we began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the value of each employee stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes model for the purpose of the pro forma financial disclosure in accordance with sfas the determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
we calculated our expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model based on the historical volatility of our stock 
as of january  we have adopted the modified prospective transition method and its effect is included in our consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended december  we will update these assumptions on at least an annual basis and on an interim basis if significant changes to the assumptions are warranted 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  and year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following management s discussion and analysis or plan of operation is based primarily upon our identity management segment 
results as presented do not contain the results of our digital photography component nor our wholly owned subsidiary  digital imaging asia pacific  due to these components being classified as discontinued operations due to the sale of digital photography in november and digital imaging asia pacific in the first fiscal quarter of revenues product revenues twelve months ended december  change change product revenues software and royalties percentage of total net product revenue hardware and consumables percentage of total net product revenue services percentage of total net product revenue patent licensing percentage of total net product revenue total net product revenues identity management software and royalties increased in from this increase is reflective of increased sales of our biometric engine and epi identity management products into project oriented solutions 
also contributing to this increase were royalties generated from our iws desktop security product release in the fourth fiscal quarter of the increase in project oriented revenues was offset by a decrease in sales of boxed product through our distribution channel 
the decrease in our identity management software and royalties of in from is reflective of lower sales of identity management solutions to law enforcement customers due to decreased procurement by state and local governments offset by an increase in sales of our biometric engine and identity management software products into project oriented solutions and an increase in boxed software sold through our distribution channel 
hardware and consumable product sales decreased approximately or  during twelve months ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in and reflects the repositioning of our international sales office in germany in order to lower fixed costs and pursue significant identification projects utilizing the company s software technologies as our primary differentiator 
this office had historically emphasized the resale of third party merchandise hardware and consumables which generated lower gross margins than software as a percentage of revenue and required significant fixed costs for sales  service and support 
in furtherance of this strategy  in december  we decided to reorganize our german sales office by closing our existing facility in order to reduce operating expenses 
the effect on hardware and consumables revenues from the closure of this office was a reduction of such revenues of approximately  in as compared to hardware and consumable product sales increased in from  reflecting an increase in domestic sales of such products offset by reduced international sales due to the initiation of the closure of our german sales office 
we are of the opinion that foreign markets formerly served by this office will embrace our identification and biometric solutions for large scale high end installations 
we continue to be of the opinion that government agencies and private entities will react to heightened security concerns resulting from acts of terrorism by re evaluating and upgrading their ability to positively identify and track their citizens  employees  consultants and visitors 
we anticipate that these factors will continue to increase overall demand for our identity management products  however  we cannot predict the timing of the shift in demand 
services revenues are comprised primarily of software integration services  system installation services and customer training 
such revenues decreased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the corresponding period of due primarily to the composition of our customer s orders and a decrease in our installation of hardware products 
service revenues decreased or  during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in due to a decrease in both software and hardware installation services of identity management solutions sold including implementation services for a web based  investigative law enforcement system for the new south wales police department completed during the first fiscal quarter of we expect service revenues to increase in through our implementation of large scale high end installations 
we generated revenues of  from sublicensing our image editing system patent within the computer video  web conferencing and cellular phone fields of use during the twelve months ended december  there were no such revenues earned in the comparable periods of or we feel that we continue to remain well positioned for participation in one or more large scale domestic or international projects which will enable the company to achieve significant product revenue growth in our identity management segment 
in the past twelve months we have retooled our identity management suite of products to enable customization for large project applications  added the biometric engine for incorporation into large scale biometric installations and reoriented our organization to direct our resources and capabilities toward establishing a foothold in the market for large scale secure identity management solutions 
we further believe that continued incidents of terrorism have created heightened interest in the ability of law enforcement and other government agencies to be able to efficiently retrieve  analyze and share information from their respective identity management databases 
we anticipate that these factors will increase overall demand for the company s products  however  we cannot predict the timing of the shift in demand 
our backlog of product orders as of december   was approximately  at december   we also had maintenance and support backlog of approximately  under existing maintenance agreements 
product revenue is typically recognized within a three to six month period depending upon the required degree of customization  if any 
historically  we have experienced a very minimal risk of order cancellation and do not anticipate order cancellations in excess of 
our revenue from maintenance agreements is generally recognized ratably over the respective maintenance periods provided no significant obligations remain and collectibility of the related receivable is probable 
maintenance revenues twelve months ended december  change change maintenance revenues maintenance revenues increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in and reflects the expansion of our installed base resulting from the completion of significant project oriented work during the year ended december  likewise  our increase in maintenance revenues for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in reflects the expansion of our installed base during combined with our retention of existing maintenance customers 
we anticipate continued growth of our installed base through the retention of existing customers combined with the completion of project oriented work  however we cannot predict the timing of this anticipated growth

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates have an impact on our results of operations 
our exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates is primarily related to our subsidiaries operating expense  primarily in canada and germany  denominated in the respective local currency 
we currently do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates should not have a material effect on our future operating results or cash flows  however  a long term change in foreign currency rates would likely result in increased technical support and engineering expenses 
the vast majority of our sales are transacted in u

dollars
