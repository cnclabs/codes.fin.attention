item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets innovative systems for the treatment of end stage renal disease  or esrd  acute kidney failure and fluid overload 
our primary product  the nxstage system one  is a small  portable  easy to use hemodialysis system designed to provide physicians and patients improved flexibility in how hemodialysis therapy is prescribed and delivered 
we believe the largest market opportunity for our product is the home hemodialysis market for the treatment of esrd 
from our inception in until  our operations consisted primarily of start up activities  including designing and developing the system one  recruiting personnel and raising capital 
historically  research and development costs have been our single largest operating expense 
however  with the launch of the system one in the home chronic care market  selling and marketing costs became our largest operating expense in and continued to be our largest operating expense during as we expanded our us sales force to increase market share and grow revenues 
our overall strategy since inception has been to design and develop new products for the treatment of kidney failure  establish that the products are safe  effective and cleared for use in the united states  further enhance the product design through field experience from a limited number of customers  establish reliable manufacturing and sources of supply  execute a market launch in both the chronic and critical care markets and establish the system one as a preferred system for the treatment of kidney failure  obtain the capital necessary to finance our working capital needs and build our business and achieve profitability 
the evolution of nxstage  and the allocation of our resources since we were founded  reflects this plan 
we believe we have largely completed steps through  and we plan to continue to pursue the other strategic objectives described above 
we sell our products in two markets the chronic care market and the critical care market 
we define the chronic care market as the market devoted to the treatment of patients with esrd and the critical care market as the market devoted to the treatment of hospital based patients with acute kidney failure or fluid overload 
we offer a different configuration of the system one for each market 
the united states food and drug administration  or fda  has cleared both configurations for hemodialysis  hemofiltration and ultrafiltration 
our products may be used by our customers to treat patients suffering from esrd or acute kidney failure and we have separate marketing and sales efforts dedicated to each market 
we received clearance from the fda in july to market the system one for treatment of renal failure and fluid overload using hemodialysis as well as hemofiltration and ultrafiltration 
in the first quarter of  we initiated sales of the system one in the critical care market to hospitals and medical centers in the united states 
in late  we initiated sales of the system one in the chronic care market and commenced full commercial introduction in the chronic market in september in the united states 
at the time of these early marketing efforts  our system one was cleared by the fda under a general indication statement  allowing physicians to prescribe the system one for hemofiltration  hemodialysis and or ultrafiltration at the location  time and frequency they considered in the best interests of their patients 
our original indication did not include a specific home clearance  and we were not able to promote the system one for home use at that time 
the fda cleared the system one in june for hemodialysis in the home 
in march  we received clearance from the fda to market our pureflow sl module as an alternative to the bagged fluid presently used with our system one in the chronic care market  and we commercially launched the pureflow sl module in july this accessory to the system one allows for the preparation of high purity dialysate in the patient s home using ordinary tap water and dialysate concentrate 
the pureflow sl is designed to help patients with esrd more conveniently and effectively manage their home hemodialysis therapy by eliminating the need for bagged fluids 
since its launch  pureflow sl penetration has reached approximately of all of our chronic patients 
the product is still early in its commercial launch and we continue to work to improve product reliability and user experience  based upon customer feedback 
we expect that over time our chronic care home patients will predominantly use our pureflow sl module at home and will use bagged fluid for travel and use outside of the home 
bagged fluids will continue to be used in the critical care market 

table of contents medicare provides comprehensive and well established reimbursement in the united states for esrd 
reimbursement claims for therapy using the system one are typically submitted by the dialysis clinic or hospital to medicare and other third party payors using established billing codes for dialysis treatment or  in the critical care setting  based on the patient s primary diagnosis 
expanding medicare reimbursement over time to cover more frequent therapy may be critical to our market penetration and revenue growth in the future 
our system one is produced through internal and outsourced manufacturing 
we purchase many of the components and subassemblies included in the system one  as well as the disposable cartridges used in the system one  from third party manufacturers  some of which are single source suppliers 
in addition to outsourcing with third party manufacturers  we assemble  package and label a small quantity of disposable products in our leased facilities in lawrence  massachusetts and north andover  massachusetts 
nxstage gmbh co 
kg  our wholly owned german subsidiary  is the sole manufacturer of the dialyzing filter that is a component of the disposable cartridge used in the system one 
we market the system one through a direct sales force in the united states primarily to dialysis clinics and hospitals and we expect revenues to continue to increase in the near future 
our revenues were million in  a increase from revenues of million in we have increased the number of sales representatives in our combined sales force from at december  to at december  we expect to add additional sales and marketing personnel as needed in the future 
at december    esrd patients were using the system one at dialysis clinics  compared to esrd patients at dialysis clinics at december  in addition  at december   hospitals were using the system one for critical care therapy  compared to hospitals at december  the following table sets forth the amount and percentage of revenues derived from each market for the periods indicated years ended december  critical care chronic care total we have not been profitable since inception  and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we expand our sales efforts and operations 
our accumulated deficit at december  was million 
our goal is to increase our sales volume and revenues to realize operating economies of scale and reduced product costs  which we believe  when combined with product design improvements  will allow us to reach profitability 
we expect our revenues in the chronic care market to increase faster than those in the critical care market and believe they will continue to represent the majority of our revenues 
statement of operations components revenues our products consist of the system one  an electromechanical device used to circulate the patient s blood during therapy the cycler  a single use  disposable cartridge  which contains a preattached dialyzer  and dialysate fluid used in our therapy  sold either in premixed bags or prepared with our pureflow sl module 
we distribute our products in two markets the chronic care market and the critical care market 
we define the chronic care market as the market devoted to the treatment of esrd patients in the home and the critical care market as the market devoted to the treatment of hospital based patients with acute kidney failure or fluid overload 
we offer a different configuration of the system one for each market 
the fda has cleared both configurations for hemodialysis  hemofiltration and ultrafiltration 
our products may be used by our customers to treat patients suffering from either condition and we have separate marketing and sales efforts dedicated to each market 

table of contents we derive our revenues from the sale and rental of equipment and the sale of the related disposable products 
in the critical care market  we generally sell the system one and disposables to hospital customers 
in the chronic care market  customers generally rent the machine and then purchase the related disposable products based on a specific patient prescription 
we generally recognize revenues when a product has been delivered to our customer  or  in the chronic care market  for those customers that rent the system one  we recognize revenues on a monthly basis in accordance with a contract under which we supply the use of a cycler and the amount of disposables needed to perform a set number of dialysis therapy sessions during a month 
our contracts with dialysis centers for esrd patients generally include terms providing for the sale of disposable products to accommodate up to treatments per month per patient and the purchase or monthly rental of system one cyclers and  in some instances  our pureflow sl module 
these contracts typically have a term of one year and are cancelable at any time by the dialysis clinic with days notice 
under these contracts  if home hemodialysis is prescribed  supplies are shipped directly to patient homes and paid for by the treating dialysis clinic 
we also include vacation delivery terms  providing for the free shipment of products to a designated vacation destination 
we derive an insignificant amount of revenues from the sale of ancillary products  such as extra lengths of tubing 
over time  as more chronic patients are treated with the system one and more systems are placed in patient homes under monthly agreements that provide for the rental of the machine and the purchase of the related disposables  we expect this recurring revenue stream to continue to grow 
in early  we entered into long term contracts with three larger dialysis chains  including with davita  which was our largest customer in revenues from davita represented approximately of our revenue in and we expect revenue from this customer will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in each of these agreements has a term of at least three years  and may be cancelled upon a material breach  subject to certain curing rights 
these contracts provide the option to purchase as well as rent the system one equipment  and  in the case of the davita contract  davita has agreed to purchase rather than rent a significant percentage of its future system one equipment needs 
in the first quarter of  two of these dialysis chain customers elected to purchase  rather than rent  a significant percentage of their system one equipment currently in use 
it is not clear what percentage of our customers  if any  will migrate to this model  and we expect  at least in the near term  that the majority of our customers will continue to rent the system one in the chronic care market 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of direct product costs  including material and labor required to manufacture our products  service of system one equipment that we rent and sell to customers and production overhead 
it also includes the cost of inspecting  servicing and repairing equipment prior to sale or during the warranty period and stock based compensation 
the cost of our products depends on several factors  including the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  the cost at which we can obtain labor and products from third party suppliers  product reliability and related servicing costs  and the design of the products 
we are currently operating at negative gross profit as we continue to build a base of recurring revenues 
we expect the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to decline over time for four general reasons 
first  we anticipate that increased sales volume and realization of economies of scale will lead to better purchasing terms and prices and broader options  and efficiencies in indirect manufacturing overhead costs 
for example  during  we transitioned our purchases of dialysate to a new  lower cost vendor 
second  we are introducing several process and product design changes that have inherently lower cost than our current products 
for example  in july we commercially released our pureflow sl module  which is expected to reduce our cost of revenues and distribution costs by reducing the volume of dialysate fluid which we currently purchase and ship to customers 
third  we plan to move the manufacture of certain of our products  including the system one cycler  to lower labor cost markets 
finally  we continue to improve product reliability 

table of contents operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for sales and marketing personnel  travel  promotional and marketing materials and other expenses associated with providing clinical training to our customers 
included in selling and marketing are the costs of clinical educators  usually nurses  we employ to teach our customers about our products and prepare our customers to instruct their patients in the operation of the system one 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we broaden our marketing initiatives to increase public awareness of the system one in the chronic care market and as we add additional sales and marketing personnel 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for research and development personnel  supplies  materials and expenses associated with product design and development  clinical studies  regulatory submissions  reporting and compliance and expenses incurred for outside consultants or firms who furnish services related to these activities 
we expect limited research and development expense increases in the foreseeable future as we continue to improve and enhance our core products 
distribution 
distribution expenses include the freight cost of delivering our products to our customers or our customers patients  depending on the market and the specific agreement with our customers  and salary  benefits and stock based compensation for distribution personnel 
we use common carriers and freight companies to deliver our products and we do not operate our own delivery service 
also included in this category are the expenses of shipping products from customers back to our service center for repair if the product is under warranty  and the related expense of shipping a replacement product to our customers 
we expect that distribution expenses will increase at a lower rate than revenues due to expected efficiencies gained from increased business volume  the expected customer adoption of our pureflow sl module  which significantly reduces the weight and quantity of monthly disposable shipments  and improved reliability of system one equipment 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for our executive management  legal and finance and accounting staff  fees from outside legal counsel  fees for our annual audit and tax services and general expenses to operate the business  including insurance and other corporate related expenses 
rent  utilities and depreciation expense are allocated to operating expenses based on personnel and square footage usage 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the near term as we add additional administrative support for our growing business

the number of chronic care patients on therapy was  at december  compared to at december  in addition  we added dialysis clinics in offering the system one 
revenues in the chronic care market increased to million in from million in  an increase of  while revenues in the critical care market increased to million in  compared to million in we added an additional hospitals in that offer the system one 

table of contents cost of revenues and gross profit deficit year ended december  december  percentage increase increase in thousands  except percentages cost of revenues gross profit deficit gross profit percentage the increase in cost of revenues was attributable primarily to our increased sales volume 
for the chronic care market  we added net patients during  which contributed to a million increase in cost of revenues 
in addition  cost of revenues increased during because of an increase in manufacturing personnel which resulted in additional salaries  health benefits and payroll taxes of million  higher servicing costs of million and increased inbound freight costs of million to support our higher production volume 
we are currently operating at negative gross profit as we continue to build our base of recurring revenues 
the improvement in gross margin during was attributable to i increased sales volume and realization of economies of scale that led to better purchasing terms and prices  and efficiencies in indirect manufacturing overhead costs  ii lower labor costs for the manufacture of certain of our products  and iii continued improvement in product reliability 
we expect the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue to decline over time for these same reasons 
in addition  we expect the new pureflow sl to help reduce future costs of our product offerings 
inventory at december  and december  has been reduced to net realizable value through charges to cost of revenues 
selling and marketing year ended december  december  percentage increase increase in thousands  except percentages selling and marketing selling and marketing as a percentage of revenues the increase in selling and marketing expenses was the result of several factors 
approximately million of the increase was due to higher salary and benefits resulting from increased headcount   related to stock based compensation as a result of the adoption in january of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment 
the increase in selling and marketing expense was also the result of million related to a higher level of sales and marketing activity in both the chronic and critical care markets 
we increased our combined sales force from sales representatives at december  to sales representatives at december  we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we broaden our marketing initiatives to increase public awareness of the system one in the chronic care market and as we add additional sales and marketing personnel

r  offset by a decrease of  of development costs associated with our pureflow sl module which we incurred in that did not recur in we expect limited research and development expense increases in the foreseeable future as a substantial portion of the development effort on the system one and pureflow sl has been completed and future expenditures will be limited to enhancements 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to decline as a percentage of revenues 
distribution year ended december  december  percentage increase increase in thousands  except percentages distribution distribution as a percentage of revenues the increase in distribution expenses in was due to increased volume of shipments of disposable products to a growing number of patients in the chronic care market 
we expect that distribution expenses will increase at a lower rate than revenues during due to expected shipping efficiencies gained from increased business volume and density of customers  and the reduction of higher cost deliveries associated with bagged fluid due to the commercial launch of our pureflow sl module which began in july general and administrative year ended december  december  percentage increase increase in thousands  except percentages general and administrative general and administrative as a percentage of revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to approximately million of stock based compensation as a result of the adoption in january of sfas no

we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we add support structure for our growing business and as a result of costs related to operating as a public company 
interest income and interest expense interest income is derived primarily from us government securities  certificates of deposit  commercial paper and money market accounts 
for the year ended december   interest income increased by million due to increased cash and investment balances available for investment resulting from our initial public offering and follow on public offering and  to a lesser degree  higher interest rates 
interest expense increased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to the early payoff of a debt agreement  which resulted in the early recognition of approximately  of interest expense during the second quarter of we expect interest expense will continue to increase in the future as a result of our gross borrowings and continued availability under our equipment line of credit

general and administrative year ended december  december  percentage increase increase in thousands  except percentages general and administrative general and administrative as a percentage of revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salary and benefits as a result of the addition of four employees to headcount as well as the adoption of a management bonus plan in interest income and interest expense interest income is derived primarily from us government securities  certificates of deposit and money market accounts 
for the year ended december   interest income increased to million from million in primarily due to increased cash and investment balances after our initial public offering and slightly higher interest rates in interest expense relates to a debt agreement signed in december interest expense increased from  to  or approximately  in compared to due to this indebtedness being outstanding for a full calendar year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have operated at a loss since our inception in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
on june   we closed a follow on public offering in which we received net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses  of approximately million from the sale and issuance of  shares of common stock 
on november   we closed our initial public offering in which we received net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses  of approximately million from the sale and issuance of  shares of common stock 
prior to the initial public offering  we had financed our operations primarily through private sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately million as of december  on may   we entered into an equipment line of credit agreement for the purpose of financing field equipment purchases and placements 
the line of credit agreement provides for the availability of up to million through december   and borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus as of december  
under the line of credit agreement  million was available through december  and an additional million is available from january  through december  the availability of the line of credit is subject to a number of covenants  including maintaining certain levels of liquidity  adding specified numbers of patients and operating within certain net loss parameters 
we are also required to maintain operating and or investment accounts with the lender in an amount at least equal to the outstanding debt obligation 
borrowings are secured by all of our assets other than intellectual property and are payable ratably over a three year period from the date of each borrowing 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million and million of borrowing availability under the equipment line of credit 
the following table sets forth the components of our cash flows for the periods indicated in thousands years ended december  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net cash flow net cash used in operating activities 
for each of the periods above  net cash used in operating activities was attributable primarily to net losses after adjustment for non cash charges  such as depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense 
significant uses of cash from operations include increases in accounts receivable and increased inventory requirements for production and placements of the system one  offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
non cash transfers from inventory to field equipment for the placement of rental units with our customers represented million  million and million  respectively  during the years ended december   and net cash used in investing activities 
for each of the periods above  net cash used in investing activities reflected purchases of property and equipment  primarily for research and development  information technology  manufacturing operations and capital improvements to our facilities 
excluded from these figures is the purchase of million of short term investments during  the sale of marketable securities in the amount of million during  and the purchase of million of marketable securities during net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities during included million of net proceeds received from the follow on public offering that closed in june  million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants and net borrowings of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during included million of net proceeds received from our initial public offering that closed in november  million of net proceeds received from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants  offset by debt payments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during 
table of contents included million of net proceeds received from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and net borrowings of million 
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we believe we have sufficient cash to meet our funding requirements at least through we expect to be able to extend the availability of our cash resources through the sale rather than rental of our system one cyclers to chronic customers in the future 
in february  we entered into long term agreements with three large dialysis chains  who are existing chronic customers  that provide customers the option  and in the case of davita  the obligation  to purchase  rather than rent  some portion of their system one equipment 
to date  these customers have purchased nearly million of equipment 
also in february  we received cash proceeds of million from the sale to davita of our common stock 
cash received from the sale of our common stock and sale of equipment will be used for working capital purposes 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or issue debt securities 
any sale of additional equity or issuance of debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing when needed  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our business development activities  which could harm the growth of our business 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  and the effect those commitments are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period less than more than total one year years years years in thousands notes payable obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include purchase commitments for system one components  primarily for equipment and fluids pursuant to contractual agreements with several of our suppliers 
certain of these commitments may be extended and or canceled at the company s option 
on january   we entered into a long term supply agreement with membrana gmbh 
in connection with this agreement  we have annual minimum purchase commitments of million through december   which amounts are not included in the table above 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ substantially from our estimates 
a summary of those accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf   revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenues are recognized when a there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the product has been shipped or services and supplies have been provided to the customer  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collection is reasonably assured 
in the critical care market  sales are structured as direct product sales or as a disposables based program in which a customer acquires the equipment through the purchase of a specific quantity of disposables over a specific period of time 
during the reported periods  the majority of our critical care revenues were derived from direct product sales 
in the chronic care market  revenues are realized using short term rental arrangements 
in the critical care market  we recognize revenues from direct product sales at the later of the time of shipment or  if applicable  delivery in accordance with contract terms 
for the chronic care market  during the reported periods  we recognized revenues derived from rental arrangements on a straight line basis 
these rental arrangements  which combine the use of the system one with a specified number of disposable products supplied to customers for a fixed amount per month  are recognized on a monthly basis in accordance with agreed upon contract terms and pursuant to a binding customer purchase order and fixed payment terms 
under a disposables based program  the customer is granted the right to use the equipment for a period of time  during which the customer commits to purchase a minimum number of disposable cartridges or fluids at a price that includes a premium above the otherwise average selling price of the cartridges or fluids to recover the cost of the equipment and provide for a profit 
upon reaching the contractual minimum purchases  ownership of the equipment transfers to the customer 
revenues under these arrangements are recognized over the term of the arrangement as disposables are delivered 
when we enter into a multiple element arrangement  we allocate the total revenue to all elements of the arrangement based on their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by the price charged when each element is sold separately 
our most common multiple element arrangements are products sold under a disposables based program in the critical care market as described above 
we account for the disposables based program as a single economic transaction and have determined that we do not have a basis to separate the transaction into multiple elements to recognize revenue at the time of shipment of each element 
rather  we recognize revenue related to all elements over the term of the arrangement as the disposables are delivered 
our contracts provide for training  technical support and warranty services to our customers 
we recognize training and technical support revenue when the related services are performed 
in the case of extended warranty  the revenue is recognized ratably over the warranty period 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost weighted average or estimated market 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and related cost and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on an estimated forecast of product demand for each of our existing product configurations 
we also review our inventory value to determine if it reflects lower of cost or market  with market determined based on net realizable value 
appropriate consideration is given to inventory items sold at negative gross margins  purchase commitments and other factors in evaluating net realizable value 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid development and technological advances that could result in obsolescence of inventory 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate 
field equipment we capitalize field equipment at cost and amortize field equipment through cost of revenues using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of five years 
we review the estimated useful life of five years periodically for reasonableness 
factors considered in determining the reasonableness of the useful life include industry practice and the typical amortization periods used for like equipment  the frequency and scope 
table of contents of service returns  actual equipment disposal rates  and the impact of planned design improvements 
we believe the five year useful life to be reasonable as of december  accounting for stock based awards until december   we accounted for stock based employee compensation awards in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense was recorded for stock options awarded to employees and directors to the extent that the option exercise price was less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant  where the number of shares and exercise price were fixed 
the difference between the fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of the stock option  if any  was recorded as deferred compensation and was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying stock option 
prior to becoming a public company on october   there had been no public market for our common stock 
absent an objective measure of the fair value of our common stock  the determination of fair value required judgment 
our board of directors periodically estimated the fair value of our common stock in connection with any stock option grants 
the fair value of our common stock was estimated based on factors such as independent valuations  sales of preferred stock  the liquidation preference  dividends  voting rights of the various classes of stock  our financial and operating performance  progress on development goals  the issuance of patents  the value of other companies involved in dialysis  general economic and market conditions and other factors that we believed would reasonably have a significant bearing on the value of our common stock 
prior to january   we followed the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation for stock based awards granted to employees 
all stock based awards granted to non employees were accounted for at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
and related interpretations 
for purposes of the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 
 stock options granted subsequent to july   the date of filing our initial registration statement with the sec  were valued using the black scholes option pricing model 
prior to july   we used the minimum value method permitted under sfas no 
we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  on january  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
in addition  sfas r requires the use of the prospective method for any outstanding stock options that were previously valued using the minimum value method 
accordingly  with the adoption of sfas r  we did not recognize the remaining compensation cost for any stock option awards which had previously been valued using the minimum value method 
in addition  sfas r prohibits the use of pro forma disclosures for stock option awards valued under the minimum value method ie  our pre july  stock option awards 
stock option awards granted prior to july   the date on which we filed our preliminary prospectus with the sec  that are subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  shall be subject to the provisions of sfas r 
we use the modified prospective method under sfas r for any stock options granted after july  the aggregate value of the unvested portion of stock options issued between july  and december  totaled million as of december   net of estimated forfeitures 
beginning in  we began recognizing this aggregate value as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period 
as a result of adopting sfas r on january   our net loss for the year ended december  was million higher than if we had continued to account for the share based awards under apb no 
basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended december  was higher than if we had continued to account for share based awards under apb no 
management continues to evaluate the use of stock based awards and may consider other forms of equity based compensation arrangements such as restricted stock units or reduce the volume of stock option grants in the future 
pursuant to sfas r  we reclassified  of deferred compensation relating to non qualified stock options awarded to an executive and a consultant to additional paid in capital on january  
table of contents prospectively  we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation awards on the dates of grant 
in accordance with sab  based upon our stage of development and the short period of time that our common stock has been publicly traded on the nasdaq global market  we have used the following assumptions in the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of equity based compensation awards expected term the expected term has been determined using the simplified method  as defined in sab  for estimating expected option life of plain vanilla options 
unless otherwise determined by the board or the compensation committee  stock options granted under the stock incentive plan have a contractual term of seven years  resulting in an expected term of years calculated under the simplified method 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate for each grant is equal to the us treasury rate in effect at the time of grant for instruments with an expected life similar to the expected option term 
volatility the objective in estimating expected volatility is to ascertain the assumption about expected volatility that marketplace participants would likely use in determining an exchange price for an option 
because we have no options that are traded publicly and because of our limited trading history as a public company  our volatility assumption has been based upon an analysis of the stock volatility experienced by similar companies in the medical device and technology industries  consistent with the methodology used in for the year ended december   we used a volatility rate assumption of for stock option grants 
our common stock will reach its two year trading anniversary during the fourth quarter of with two years of historical trading activity  we expect to have sufficient trading activity of our common stock on which to base our assumption about expected volatility 
we also estimated expected forfeitures of stock options upon adoption of sfas r 
in developing a forfeiture rate estimate  we considered our historical experience  our growing employee base and the limited trading history of our common stock 
actual forfeiture activity may differ from our estimated forfeiture rate 
accounting for income taxes we account for federal and state income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method specified by sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by the enacted tax rates 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income  if any 
substantially all net losses are in the united states 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and  while the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and we also had combined federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of million at december   which begin to expire in if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership percentage change limitations provided by the internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
in the event of a deemed change in control under internal revenue code section  an annual limitation imposed on the utilization of net operating losses may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards 
we have  of net operating losses resulting from excess tax deductions relating to stock based compensation 
we will realize the benefit of these losses through increases to stockholders equity in future periods when the losses are utilized to reduce future tax payments 
due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no benefit has been recognized for the net operating loss and other deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax asset has been established as of december  and to reflect these uncertainties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our investment portfolio consists primarily of high grade commercial paper  certificates of deposit and debt obligations of various governmental agencies 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made with a maturity of no more than days 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of the debt instruments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
as of december   we had outstanding debt obligations of million with a floating interest rate equal to one half percentage point above the prime rate at december  
movements in market interest rates could impact the fair value of our debt 
as of december   the carrying amount of our debt approximated fair value 
foreign currency exposure we operate a manufacturing and research facility in rosdorf  germany 
we purchase materials for that facility and pay our employees at that facility in euros 
in addition  we purchase products for resale in the united states from foreign companies and have agreed to pay them in currencies other than the us dollar 
we also have contracts with key suppliers that expose us to foreign currency risks 
as a result  our expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in periods when the us dollar declines in value as compared to the foreign currencies in which we incur expenses  our foreign currency based expenses increase when translated into us dollars 
although it is possible to do so  we do not currently hedge our foreign currency since the exposure has not been material to our historical operating results 
a movement in the euro would have had an overall impact to the statement of operations of approximately  for  which would have been approximately of total annual expenses 
equity security price risk as a matter of policy  we do not invest in marketable equity securities  therefore  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk
