item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
cautionary statement the discussion below contains forward looking statements regarding our financial condition and our results of operations that are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states  as well as projections for the future 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory actions and marketing approvals  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  competition associated with restasis and elestat  potential competition associated with our product candidates  use of hazardous materials and retention of key employees 
in order for one of our product candidates to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us  or our collaborative partners  to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of the product candidate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate significant revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations which are not historical facts are  or may constitute  forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results 
these risks are discussed in the section entitled risk factors 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
our revenues are difficult to predict and depend on several factors 
our co promotion revenues are based upon allergan s revenue recognition policy and other accounting policies  over which we have limited or no control  and on the underlying terms of our co promotion agreements 
our co promotion revenues are impacted by the number of governmental and commercial formularies upon which restasis and elestat are listed  the discounts and pricing under such formularies  as well as the estimated and actual amount of rebates  all of which are managed by allergan 
other factors that are difficult to predict and that impact our co promotion revenues are the extent and effectiveness of allergan s sales and marketing efforts as well as our own sales and marketing efforts  coverage and reimbursement under medicare part d and the marketing and sales activities of competitors  among others 
revenues related to development activities are dependent upon the progress toward and the achievement of developmental milestones by us or our collaborative partners 
our operating expenses are also difficult to predict and depend on several factors 
research and development expenses  including expenses for drug synthesis and manufacturing  preclinical testing and clinical research activities  depend on the ongoing requirements of our development programs  completion and or success of business development transactions  availability of capital and direction from regulatory agencies  which are difficult to predict 
management may in some cases be able to control the timing of research and development expenses  in part by accelerating or decelerating preclinical testing  basic research activities  and clinical trial activities  but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of whether our product candidates are approved when anticipated or at all 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant selling and marketing expenses to commercialize our products 
once again  management may in some cases be able to control the 
table of contents timing and magnitude of these expenses 
in addition  we have incurred and expect to incur significant general and administrative expenses as we work to resolve our current stockholder litigation and sec investigation 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering  developing and commercializing prescription pharmaceutical products in disease areas with significant commercial potential or unmet medical needs 
our goal is to build and commercialize a sustainable pipeline of new treatments based upon our technical and scientific expertise  focusing in the ophthalmic and respiratory allergy therapeutic areas 
our ophthalmic products and product candidates are currently concentrated in the allergic and bacterial conjunctivitis  dry eye disease and glaucoma indications 
our respiratory allergy product candidates are currently concentrated in the treatment of respiratory complications of cystic fibrosis and seasonal allergic rhinitis indications 
in  we expanded our operations beyond research and development activities by creating a commercial organization to co promote two of allergan s eye products  elestat and restasis in the united states 
in january  we began co promoting restasis for the treatment of dry eye disease 
in february  we launched elestat for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis 
under agreements with allergan  we receive co promotion revenue based upon allergan s net sales of these products 
prior to  we devoted substantially all of our efforts to the discovery and clinical development of our product candidates as well as the establishment of strategic partnerships and our revenues consisted of payments under our various corporate partnerships established for the development and commercialization of our products if approved 
see part i of this report for a full discussion of our co promotion agreements with allergan and other significant collaborative agreements 
in february  we entered into a development and license agreement with boehringer ingelheim 
the agreement grants us certain exclusive rights to develop and market an intranasal dosage form of epinastine  in the united states and canada  for the treatment or prevention of rhinitis 
in october  we entered into a licensing agreement with faes for the us and canadian development and commercialization of bilastine  a phase oral antihistamine compound for the treatment and prevention of allergic rhinitis 
faes announced the acceptance of an ind application by the fda in april and there is currently an ongoing thorough qt qtc clinical trial in the united states  the top line results of which are expected to be reported in the second quarter of in february  we signed an exclusive licensing agreement with insite vision for us and canadian commercialization of azasite for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis 
insite vision previously filed an nda for azasite with the fda in june the completion of the fda s review of the nda for azasite is expected by the end of april see part i of this report for a full discussion of all our in licensing activities  as well our other product candidates in clinical development 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for the next several years 
we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and public offerings of common stock  debt  and with revenue from corporate partnerships  including co promotion revenue 
co promotion revenue from elestat and restasis did not exceed our total operating expenses in we operate in a single business segment and do not have any foreign operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and the policies underlying these estimates on a periodic basis as situations change  and regularly discuss financial events  policies  and issues with members of our audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm 
in addition  recognition of revenue from product co promotion is affected by certain estimates and judgments made by allergan on which we rely in recording this revenue 
we routinely evaluate our estimates and policies regarding revenue recognition  taxes  clinical trial  preclinical toxicology  manufacturing  research and other service liabilities 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we record all of our revenue from product co promotion activities and collaborative research agreements in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize co promotion revenue based on net sales for elestat and restasis  as defined in the co promotion agreements  and as reported to us by allergan 
we actively promote both elestat and restasis through our commercial organization and share in any risk of loss due to returns and other allowances  as determined by allergan 
accordingly  our co promotion revenues are based upon allergan s revenue recognition policy and other accounting policies over which we have limited or no control and on the underlying terms of our co promotion agreements 
allergan recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
the co promotion agreements provide for gross sales to be reduced by estimates of sales returns  credits and allowances  normal trade and cash discounts  managed care sales rebates and other allocated costs as defined in the agreements  all of which are determined by allergan and are outside our control 
we record a percentage of allergan s net sales for both elestat and restasis  reported to us by allergan  as co promotion revenue 
we receive monthly net sales information from allergan and perform analytical reviews and trend analyses using prescription information that we receive from ims health  an independent provider of pharmaceutical data 
in addition  we exercise our audit rights under the contractual agreements with allergan to annually perform an examination of allergan s sales records of both elestat and restasis 
we make no adjustments to the amounts reported to us by allergan other than reductions in net sales to reflect the incentive programs managed by us 
we offer and manage certain incentive programs associated with elestat  which are utilized by us in addition to those programs managed by allergan 
we reduce revenue by estimating the portion of sales that are subject to these incentive programs based on information reported to us by our third party administrator of the incentive programs 
in each of the years ended december   and  the amount of rebates associated with our incentive programs was less than one half of one percent of our co promotion revenues 
the rebates associated with the programs we manage represent an insignificant amount  as compared to the rebate and discount programs administered by allergan and as compared to our aggregate co promotion revenue 
under the co promotion agreement for elestat  we are obligated to meet predetermined minimum calendar year net sales target levels 
if the annual minimum is not satisfied  we record revenues using a reduced percentage of net sales based upon our level of achievement of predetermined calendar year net sales target levels 
amounts receivable from allergan in excess of recorded co promotion revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
we achieved our annual net sales target level during the three month period ended june  we recognize revenue under our collaborative research and development agreements when we have performed services under such agreements or when we or our collaborative partner have met a contractual 
table of contents milestone triggering a payment to us 
we recognize revenue from our research and development service agreements ratably over the estimated service period as related research and development costs are incurred and the services are substantially performed 
upfront non refundable fees and milestone payments received at the initiation of collaborative agreements for which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are deferred and recognized ratably over the period in which the services are substantially performed 
this period  if not defined in the collaborative agreement  is based on estimates by management and the progress towards agreed upon development events as set forth in our collaborative agreements 
these estimates are subject to revision as our development efforts progress and we gain knowledge regarding required additional development 
revisions in the commitment period are made in the period that the facts related to the change first become known 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee or revenue related to ongoing research and development services is modified on a prospective basis 
we are also entitled to receive milestone payments under our collaborative research and development agreements based upon the achievement of agreed upon development events that are substantively at risk by our collaborative partners or us 
this collaborative research revenue is recognized upon the achievement and acknowledgement of our collaborative partner of a development event  which is generally at the date payment is received from the collaborative partner or is reasonably assured 
accordingly  our revenue recognized under our collaborative research and development agreements may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in the year ended december   we recognized million of collaborative research revenue 
no collaborative research revenue was recognized for the years ended december  and taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  against all potential tax assets due to uncertainties in our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
liabilities we generally enter into contractual agreements with third party vendors to provide clinical  preclinical toxicology  manufacturing  research and other services in the ordinary course of business 
many of these contracts are subject to milestone based invoicing and services are completed over an extended period of time 
we record liabilities under these contractual commitments when we determine an obligation has been incurred  regardless of the timing of the invoice 
we monitor all significant research and development  manufacturing  promotion and marketing and other service activities and the progression of work related to these activities 
we estimate the underlying obligation for each activity based upon our estimate of the amount of work performed and compare the estimated obligation against the amount that has been invoiced 
because of the nature of certain contracts and related delay in the contract s invoicing  the obligation to these vendors may be based upon management s estimate of the underlying obligation 
we record the larger of our estimated obligation or invoiced amounts for completed service 
in all cases  actual results may differ from our estimate 
stock option expense as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  which requires us to measure compensation cost for share based payment awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for our awards and will recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of our awards 
the estimation of share based payment awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are 
table of contents revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
we use a blended volatility calculation utilizing volatility of peer group companies with similar operations and financial structures in addition to our own historical volatility 
significant management judgment is required in determining estimates of future stock price volatility  forfeitures and expected life to be used in the valuation of the options 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
we have implemented the modified prospective method in recognizing stock based compensation expense for upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
under this method  we are required to record compensation expense for all share based payments granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted stock option awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
for stock options granted to non employees  we have recognized compensation expense in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
sfas no 
required that companies recognize compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of options granted to non employees over their vesting period  which is generally the period during which services are rendered by such non employees 
see impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in this section of the report as well as note stock based compensation for additional discussion of the impact of adopting sfas no 
r 
impact of inflation although it is difficult to predict the impact of inflation on our costs and revenues in connection with our products  we do not anticipate that inflation will materially impact our costs of operation or the profitability of our products when marketed 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in the increase in revenue of approximately million  or  was due to increased co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat and restasis in  as compared to  as well as the recognition of a development milestone of million for diquafosol tetrasodium from santen in accordance with our development  license and supply agreement 
co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million in  and approximately million in the increase in co promotion revenue for elestat of approximately million  or  was primarily due to an increase in the market share of elestat  a price increase for elestat that became effective during the first quarter of  as well as an overall increase in the us allergic conjunctivitis market  defined by branded prescription  topically applied products to treat allergic conjunctivitis 
co promotion revenue from net sales of restasis for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million in  and approximately million in restasis is currently the only approved prescription product indicated for dry eye disease 
the increase in co promotion revenue for restasis of approximately million  or  was primarily due to increased patient usage of restasis  based on the increase of prescriptions year over year  a price increase that became effective during the first quarter of  and to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of physicians prescribing restasis 
in addition  in april there was a scheduled increase of the percentage of net sales of restasis to which we were entitled 
in  the revenue generated from our co promotion of elestat and restasis exceeded our selling and marketing expenses 
the increase in revenue  as compared to  was due to significantly increased co promotion revenue from net sales of both elestat and restasis 
this increase is attributable to a full year of co promotion 
table of contents activities in for both products  increased market share for elestat  and increased acceptance of restasis  based on the increase of prescriptions year over year  and an increase of the percentage of net sales of restasis to which we were entitled effective april 
in  the revenue generated from our commercial organization exceeded our selling and marketing expenses 
when compared to  co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat increased and co promotion revenue from net sales of restasis increased 
we began realizing co promotion revenue from elestat beginning in february all of our revenue related to elestat is from net sales in the united states according to the terms of our collaborative agreement with allergan 
elestat is a seasonal product with product demand mirroring seasonal trends for topical allergic conjunctivitis products 
typically  demand is highest during the spring months followed by moderate demand in the summer and fall months 
the lowest demand is during the winter months 
for the year ended december   elestat was the second most prescribed allergic conjunctivitis product in the united states  based upon prescription volume data as reported by ims health  and in our target universe  the top highest prescribing ophthalmologists  optometrists  and allergists in each of our sales territories 
based upon weekly national prescription data from ims health  elestat had a market share of approximately for total prescription volume in our target universe for the three and twelve months ended december   as compared to and  for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
based upon weekly data from ims health  the total us allergic conjunctivitis market  in terms of prescriptions  increased approximately and approximately for the years ended december   and  respectively  compared to the previous year 
for the year ended december   elestat represented approximately of the total us allergic conjunctivitis market  as compared to approximately in and approximately in based on current trends in prescriptions for elestat  we expect no market share growth or declining market share in future periods  unless we expand our commercial rights to elestat 
in regards to co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat  we are entitled to an escalating percentage of net sales based upon predetermined calendar year net sales target levels 
during a fiscal year  we recognize product co promotion revenue associated with targeted net sales levels for elestat achieved during that time period and defer revenue in excess of the sales level achieved 
we achieved the annual net sales target level for elestat during the three month period ended june   the annual net sales target level in the three month period ended june   and achieved the annual net sales target level in the three month period ended september  since the launch of elestat  allergan has secured coverage on formularies of certain commercial and government plans 
this coverage allows allergan and us to increase and maintain prescription market share  but generally requires price concessions through rebate programs which impact the level of co promotion revenue that we receive from net sales of elestat 
due to the large number of competing products in the allergic conjunctivitis market  some of these price concessions have been significant 
since the beginning of when medicare part d became effective  there has been a decrease in prescriptions for elestat reimbursed by state medicaid programs which were partially offset by an increase of prescriptions reimbursed under medicare part d plans and to a lesser extent  commercial plans 
this shift to medicare part d plans has resulted in lesser amounts of rebates than under medicaid programs 
additionally  in  elestat lost coverage under several state medicaid plans 
while we do not expect the loss of these coverages to significantly impact our portion of the co promotion revenue due to the large price concessions associated with these particular states  future loss of coverage under additional states or commercial plans may have a negative impact on our co promotion revenue 
the commercial marketing exclusivity period for elestat provided under the hatch waxman act will expire in october  after which time elestat could face generic or over the counter competition if there is no other intellectual property or marketing exclusivity protection covering elestat 
we are aware that several generic pharmaceutical companies have expressed intent to commercialize the ocular form of epinastine after the commercial exclusivity period expires 
while we are exploring various possible forms of additional intellectual property coverage to protect the commercialization of elestat in the united states  there can be no assurance that 
table of contents any form of intellectual property protection covering elestat will be possible in the united states after the expiration of the commercial exclusivity period under the hatch waxman act in october if a generic form of elestat is introduced into the market  our agreement with allergan to co promote elestat will no longer be in effect  and our revenues attributable to elestat will cease 
loss of our co promotion revenue from elestat will materially impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we began co promotion activities related to restasis in january and began receiving co promotion revenue in april all of our revenue from restasis is based on worldwide net sales of restasis according to the terms of our collaborative agreement with allergan 
however  less than of our co promotion revenue from restasis is derived from sales of restasis outside of the united states 
our entitled percentage of net sales of restasis increased in april and the last scheduled increase will occur in april co promotion revenue from restasis is becoming a larger component of our total co promotion revenue 
for the year ended december   co promotion revenue from restasis represented approximately of our total co promotion revenue compared to approximately in we expect that this trend will continue in and future reporting periods 
for the year ended december   allergan recorded approximately million of revenue from net sales of restasis  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in restasis  in terms of prescription volume  has grown significantly since it was first launched in april since we began co promoting restasis in january  total prescriptions  as reported by ims health  have been approximately million  million and million for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
this represents year over year prescription volume increases of and for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
in march  santen completed its phase clinical trial testing of diquafosol tetrasodium in japan  which entitled us to receive a milestone payment of million 
santen is responsible for all development  regulatory submissions  filings and approvals  and the commercialization of potential products in japan and nine other asian countries 
we could receive additional development milestone payments from santen of up to million  as well as royalties on net sales of diquafosol tetrasodium  if the product candidate is approved for commercialization in santen s licensed territories 
in  santen began phase clinical trials in japan for diquafosol tetrasodium 
our future revenue will depend on various factors including the continued commercial success of elestat and restasis  pricing  rebates  discounts and returns for both products  coverage and reimbursement under commercial or government plans  our entitled percentage of us net sales of restasis which will have a final increase in april  seasonality of sales of elestat and duration of market exclusivity of elestat and restasis 
if allergan significantly under estimates or over estimates rebate amounts  there could be a material effect on our revenue 
in addition to sales of elestat and restasis  our revenue will also depend on whether we enter additional collaboration agreements  achieve milestones under existing or future collaboration agreements and whether we obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates 
costs and expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in included in the research and development expenses for the year ended december   is approximately  of stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   including stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock units issued for the first time in july there is no stock based compensation expense included in research and development for years ended december  and  respectively  due to our adoption of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 

table of contents the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to the development activities associated with our epinastine nasal spray program for seasonal allergic rhinitis  including the payment of a million up front licensing fee and the initiation of phase clinical trials  the in licensing of bilastine  a phase oral antihistamine compound for which we paid an upfront licensing fee of million in november  and performing preclinical research and filing an ind for our glaucoma program 
in addition  we had increased costs associated with our denufosol for cystic fibrosis program  relating to the initiation of the phase tiger clinical trial  as well as increased costs related to our antiplatelet program  which included conducting our proof of concept phase clinical trial 
on august   we announced the termination of the antiplatelet clinical trial based upon the unanimous recommendation of our independent data monitoring committee  following a planned interim safety analysis 
these cost increases were partially offset by less spending on our prolacria program as we continued our discussions with the fda regarding the future of this program  the discontinuation of the denufosol for retinal disease program in january and the discontinuation of the corneal wound healing program in august the decrease in research and development expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to significantly less spending on prolacria due to our nda amendment filing on june  additionally  we spent less on our denufosol for retinal disease program due to the discontinuation of this program 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in denufosol for cystic fibrosis expenditures related to conducting six month and twelve month inhalation toxicology studies and phase clinical trials during prior to initiation of our phase program  as well as an increase in expenses related to our corneal wound healing phase pilot study which was initiated in but was later discontinued in the third quarter of research and development expenses include all direct and indirect costs  including salaries for our research and development personnel  consulting fees  clinical trial costs  sponsored research costs  clinical trial insurance  up front license fees  milestone and royalty payments relating to research and development  and other fees and costs related to the development of product candidates 
research and development expenses vary according to the number of programs in preclinical and clinical development and the stage of development of our clinical programs 
later stage clinical programs tend to cost more than earlier stage programs due to the length of the clinical trial and the number of patients enrolled in later stage clinical trials 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and and from the respective project s inception are shown below and includes the percentage of overall research and development expenditures for the years listed 
in thousands year ended december  cumulative from inception to december  denufosol tetrasodium for cystic fibrosis epinastine nasal spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis bilastine for seasonal allergic rhinitis ins for use in acute cardiac care ins for glaucoma denufosol tetrasodium for retinal disease prolacria diquafosol tetrasodium for dry eye disease other research  preclinical and development costs total 
table of contents includes a million up front licensing fee upon the signing of the license and development agreement with boehringer ingelheim 
includes a million up front licensing fee upon the signing of the license agreement with faes 
on august   we terminated our only phase clinical trial for this program 
as of december   these programs were not in active development 
other research  preclinical and development costs represent all unallocated research and development costs or those costs allocated to preclinical programs  discontinued and or inactive programs 
these unallocated costs include personnel costs of our research  preclinical programs  internal and external general research costs and other internal and external costs of other research  preclinical and development programs 
our future research and development expenses will depend on the results and magnitude or scope of our clinical  preclinical and research activities and requirements imposed by regulatory agencies 
accordingly  our research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in addition  if we in license or out license rights to product candidates  our research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from prior periods 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in included in selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december   is approximately  of stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   including stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock units issued for the first time in july there is no stock based compensation expense included in selling and marketing for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to our adoption of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses for the year december   as compared to  resulted from an overall increase in promotional activities  primarily the increased costs associated with our sales force including increased salary  personnel related expenses and stock based compensation expense 
we adjust the timing  magnitude and targeting of our advertising  promotional  phase clinical trials and other commercial activities for elestat and restasis based on seasonal trends and other factors 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses in  as compared to  resulted from a full year of active promotion of elestat and restasis and expanded commercial activity as we continued to build the elestat brand 
our commercial organization focuses its promotional efforts on approximately  highly prescribing ophthalmologists  optometrists and allergists in our target universe 
our selling and marketing expenses include all direct costs associated with the commercial organization  which include our sales force and marketing programs 
our sales force expenses include salaries  training and educational program costs  product sample costs  fleet management and travel 
our marketing and promotion expenses include product management  promotion  advertising  public relations  phase clinical trial costs  physician training and continuing medical education and administrative expenses 
future selling and marketing expenses will depend on the level of our future commercialization activities 
we expect selling and marketing expenses will increase in periods that may immediately precede and follow product launches 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative costs were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in  and approximately million in included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   is approximately  of stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   including 
table of contents stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock units issued for the first time in july there is no stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to our adoption of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to significantly increased legal and administrative expenses associated with our stockholder litigation and sec investigation and to a lesser extent increased salary and personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation expense  business development activities and overall corporate growth 
legal fees were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in the increase in general and administrative expenses  as compared to  was primarily due to increased salary and personnel related expenses  increased legal and administrative expenses associated with our stockholder litigation and sec investigation  and overall corporate growth 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel  facility and related costs for general corporate functions  including business development  finance  accounting  legal  human resources  quality compliance  facilities and information systems 
future general and administrative expenses will depend on the level of our future research and development and commercialization activities  as well as the level of legal and administrative expenses incurred to resolve our stockholder litigation and sec investigation  and to the extent our legal expenses associated with the stockholder litigation and sec investigation are reimbursed by insurance 
we expect our future professional fees to continue to increase as a result of our stockholder litigation and sec investigation see litigation and sec investigation described elsewhere in this report 
other income expense other income  net was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for and approximately million for other income fluctuates from year to year based upon fluctuations in the interest income earned on variable cash and investment balances and realized gains and losses on investments offset by interest expense on debt and capital lease obligations 
the increase in other income for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from a portfolio mix of higher yielding investments during  and a general increase in the short term interest rate environment 
the increase in other income  as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from larger average cash and investment balances during as a result of stock offerings in the second half of and of higher yielding investments overall 
this increase was partially offset by write down of available for sale investments of approximately  due to an impairment deemed other than temporary 
future other income will depend on our future cash and investment balances  the return and change in fair market value on these investments  as well as levels of debt and the associated interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and public offerings of common stock 
in december  we entered into a loan and security agreement in order to obtain debt financing of up to million to fund in licensing opportunities and related development  including the in licensing of bilastine from faes in november we have borrowed million under this agreement 
all loan advances made under the agreement mature in march we also currently receive revenue from net sales of elestat and restasis  but do not expect this revenue to exceed our operating expenses 

table of contents at december   we had net working capital of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from approximately million at december  the decrease in working capital was principally due to the use of funds for our normal operating expenses  which exceeded the revenue we recognized 
our principal sources of liquidity at december  were approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in investments  which are considered available for sale  and the potential to borrow an additional million under our loan and security agreement 
on february   we signed an exclusive licensing agreement with insite vision for us and canadian commercialization of azasite 
an nda for azasite is currently under review by the fda for treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis 
in conjunction with this licensing agreement  we paid insite vision an upfront license fee of million and will pay an additional million milestone payment contingent upon regulatory approval by the fda 
we will also pay a royalty for the first years and a royalty thereafter on net sales of azasite for ocular infections in the united states and canada  if approved by regulatory authorities 
our working capital requirements may fluctuate in future periods depending on many factors  including the number  magnitude  scope and timing of our development programs  the costs related to the potential fda approval and launch of azasite and our other product candidates  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  regulatory investigations  and changes in regulatory requirements  the costs of obtaining patent protection for our product candidates  the timing and terms of business development activities  the rate of technological advances relevant to our operations  the timing  method and cost of the commercialization of our product candidates  the efficiency of manufacturing processes developed on our behalf by third parties  the level of required administrative and legal support  the availability of capital to support product candidate development programs we pursue  the commercial potential of our products and product candidates  legal and administrative costs associated with resolving and satisfying any potential outcome of our stockholder litigation and sec investigation  and any expansion of facility space 
our financial results will be largely contingent on events associated with the potential approval of azasite by the fda in april and the product candidate s subsequent launch  as well as favorable data and subsequent progression of our bilastine  epinastine nasal spray and prolacria programs 
the following forecasted guidance does not include the expected impact of an azasite approval in should the product candidate be approved  expected revenues and expenses would change significantly  and we would issue revised guidance 
based upon current elestat and restasis trends and projected operating plans  we expect to record aggregate revenue in the range of million and expect operating expenses to be in the range of million 
research and development expenses associated with the further development of our product candidates  as described below  are estimated to be in the range of million  including the million upfront license fee related to the execution of the azasite agreement 
total estimated sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses are estimated to be in the range of million and million  respectively 
the upper end of our range of forecasted research and development expenses assumes the following potential program progress receive favorable qt qtc clinical trial results in the second quarter of  pay an million milestone payment to faes  meet with the fda and initiate one us phase clinical trial of bilastine  complete patient enrollment and continue dosing of phase tiger clinical trial of denufosol tetrasodium for the treatment of cystic fibrosis  depending on discussions with the fda  validate a clinical endpoint related to central corneal staining and initiate an additional phase clinical trial of prolacria for the treatment of dry eye disease  receive favorable results of a phase clinical trial of epinastine nasal spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis  meet with the fda and initiate next clinical trial and toxicology work  and complete a phase clinical trial in the glaucoma program 

table of contents included within our operating expenses guidance are projected stock based compensation costs of approximately million 
this estimate is based on the unvested portion of stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of december   our current stock price  and an anticipated level of share based payments granted during  exclusive of the hiring of additional employees needed to support the launch of azasite in should our stock price change significantly from its current level  and or if our anticipated headcount changes  particularly to support an azasite launch  actual stock based compensation expense could change significantly from this projection 
however  the actual amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the future will largely depend on levels of share based payments granted in future periods and changes in our stock price 
our projected cash burn in is expected to be in the range of million 
this range includes the million up front cash payment for azasite that will be included in our research and development expense and reflected in our first quarter results  as well as the million cash milestone payment related to a favorable qt qtc clinical trial result for bilastine  which would also be reflected in research and development expense 
the current cash burn guidance does not include the potential million cash milestone payment related to an azasite fda approval  nor does it include additional borrowing under our term loan facility 
as our forecasted results will be largely dependent on key development and regulatory events  we expect to adjust our guidance throughout as additional information concerning these events is obtained 
the actual amount of operating expenses could differ significantly should our anticipated development plans change  based upon program progress and events associated with our portfolio of product candidates 
in addition  the current forecast is exclusive of regulatory approval for azasite  and therefore  revenue and operating expense guidance would change significantly upon the approval and launch of the product candidate 
if regulatory approval for azasite is received  it is likely we will draw an additional million of debt on our existing loan facility 
additionally  if we are successful with the azasite or bilastine programs  we would likely raise additional capital in the next twelve months to support our expanded commercial and development activities 
although our liquidity needs will largely be determined by key development and regulatory events  we will most likely need to obtain product candidate approvals  out license rights to our product candidates  and or raise additional capital through equity or debt financings or from other sources in order for us to continue operations beyond we currently have the ability to sell approximately million of common stock under an effective shelf registration statement  which we filed with the sec on april  on march   we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s that will permit us  if such registration statement is declared effective by the sec  to sell up to million of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and securities warrants  from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
in addition  we have the ability to borrow the remaining million under our loan facility subject to certain conditions which must occur within the commitment period which ends on june  the commitment period may be extended by us to december   subject to additional fees and upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
our ability to borrow additional amounts under the loan facility are subject to the satisfaction of any one of a number of conditions related to our progress in developing bilastine or our success in obtaining fda approval for other product candidates owned by or in licensed to us 
to the extent that none of the conditions are satisfied  we may still borrow from the term loan facility  but only in the amount by which our research and development expenditures on bilastine and or another in licensed product candidate exceed the initial advance of million 
in addition  the loan and security agreement that we entered into in december contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a certain level of liquidity based on our cash  investment and account receivables balances  as well as negative covenants that may limit us from assuming additional indebtedness and entering into other transactions as defined in the agreement 
our ability to remain within our operating expense target range is subject to several other risks including unanticipated cost overruns  the need to expand the magnitude or scope of existing development programs  the 
table of contents need to change the number or timing of clinical trials  unanticipated regulatory requirements  costs to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates  commercial success of our products and product candidates  unanticipated professional fees or settlements associated with our stockholder litigation or sec investigation and other factors described under the risk factors located elsewhere in this report 
contractual commitments as part of our drug development strategy  we outsource significant amounts of our preclinical and clinical programs and the manufacture of drug substance used in those programs 
accordingly  we have entered into contractual commitments or purchase arrangements with various clinical research organizations  manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and or drug product as well as with others 
the amount of our financial commitments which includes both cancelable and non cancelable arrangements totaled approximately million at december  in addition  we have other contractual commitments outside of drug development under cancelable and non cancelable arrangements which totaled approximately million at december  many of these commitment amounts are dependent upon the results of underlying studies  the completion of studies and or projects and certain other variable components of the agreements that may result in actual payments and the timing of those payments that differ from management s estimate 
also  at december   we have future contractual commitments to pay approximately million of lease obligations for our administrative offices  fleet vehicles  laboratory facilities and equipment 
in addition  we had outstanding debt obligations as of december  of million  of which million relates to the loan and security agreement that we entered into in december under this agreement  the debt obligation fully matures in march  with repayment of loan borrowings made according to a schedule of six monthly installments of interest only followed by equal monthly installments of principal and interest until the maturity date 
the terms of our existing license  collaboration and sponsored research agreements may require that we make future cash payments 
in the aggregate  these agreements may require payments of up to million assuming the achievement of all development milestones and up to an additional million assuming the achievement of all sales milestones 
amounts payable by us under these agreements are uncertain and are contingent on a number of factors  including the progress of our research  preclinical and development programs  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  and the commercial success of our approved products 
in addition  there is approximately  of development milestones under existing license agreements related to currently inactive development programs and we believe it is unlikely the milestones will be achieved and payments made 
we are also obligated to pay royalties on net sales  if any  of certain product candidates currently in our portfolio 
some of our existing license agreements require minimum annual license preservation fees of up to  in addition  if we obtain licenses on additional product candidates in the future  or if our collaborative arrangements identify additional product candidates  our license obligations would increase 
in conjunction with the licensing agreement for azasite that we signed with insite vision in february  we paid insite vision an upfront license fee of million 
we will also be obligated to pay an additional million milestone payment contingent upon regulatory approval by the fda 
the million upfront license fee that we paid in and the million potential milestone are not reflected in the table below 
if certain of our product candidates are approved by the fda and are subsequently commercialized  we will be obligated to pay royalties on net sales of the commercialized products 
see part i of this report for a full discussion of our royalty obligations under our in licensing agreements with insite vision for azasite  faes for bilastine and boehringer ingelheim for epinastine nasal spray 
in addition  we may enter into various manufacturing  distribution  consulting and other agreements in anticipation of an azasite launch in the second half of these agreements are not reflected in the commitments as of december   or in the underlying table below 

table of contents we have also engaged legal counsel to represent us in our sec investigation and stockholder litigation  but we are not contractually obligated to incur future costs under the applicable engagement letters 
however  we do anticipate future costs to be incurred to retain counsel until these proceedings are resolved 
because of the nature of the situation  we are unable to estimate any future commitment in regards to these legal proceedings and have not included any committed costs in our projected contractual commitment disclosures 
subject to the information and qualifications included in the above paragraph  the table below sets forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that the contracts may be terminated 
the table reflects contractual and potential obligations as of december   but does not reflect obligations entered into in some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimate and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table in thousands payment due by period as of december  contractual and potential obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations debt obligations interest on debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum annual license payments development milestone obligations sales milestone obligations total includes estimated payments for cancelable portion of fleet vehicles under a master lease agreement 
see note  commitments and contingencies for a full discussion 
includes million of other long term liabilities as recorded on our balance sheet as of december  development and sales milestone obligations represent potential amounts payable by us contingent on a number of factors  including the progress of our research  preclinical and development programs  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  and the commercial success of our approved products 
litigation on february   the first of five identical purported shareholder class action complaints was filed in the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina against us and certain of our senior officers 
each complaint alleged violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  and securities and exchange commission rule b  and focused on statements that are claimed to be false and misleading regarding a phase clinical trial of our dry eye product candidate  prolacria 
each complaint sought unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our securities during the period from june  through february  on march   following consolidation of the lawsuits into a single civil action and appointment of lead plaintiffs  the plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint  or cac 
the cac asserts claims against us and certain of our present or former senior officers or directors 
the cac asserts claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and rule b based on statements alleged to be false and misleading regarding a phase clinical trial of prolacria  and also adds claims under sections  a and of the securities act of the cac also asserts claims against certain parties that served as 
table of contents underwriters in our securities offerings during the period relevant to the cac 
the cac seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our securities during the period from may  through february  in may  the plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss their claims against the underwriters on the basis that they were time barred 
on june   inspire and other defendants moved that the court dismiss the cac on the grounds that it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and does not satisfy the pleading requirements under applicable law 
briefing on that motion is now complete and it is currently pending before the court 
we intend to defend the litigation vigorously 
as with any legal proceeding  we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of these pending lawsuits  nor can a reasonable estimate of the amounts of loss  if any  be made 
furthermore  we will have to incur expenses in connection with these lawsuits  which may be substantial 
moreover  responding to and defending the pending litigation will result in a diversion of management s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees 
we have various insurance policies related to the risk associated with our business  including directors and officers insurance 
however  there is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that our insurance companies will cover the matters claimed 
in the event of an adverse outcome  our business as well as our future results of operations  financial position and or cash flows could be materially affected to the extent that our insurance fails to cover such costs 
sec investigation on august   the sec notified us that it is conducting a formal  nonpublic investigation which we believe relates to our phase clinical trial of our dry eye product candidate  prolacria 
on october   we received a wells notice letter from the staff of the sec  issued in connection with this investigation 
our chief executive officer and our executive vice president  operations and communications  also received wells notices 
the wells notices provide notification of the sec staff s determination that it intends to recommend to the sec that it bring a civil action against us and the two officers regarding possible violations of section a of the securities act of  sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and sec rules b  b  a  a  a  and a thereunder 
under the process established by the sec  we and the two officers have the opportunity to respond in writing to the wells notice before the staff makes any formal recommendation to the sec regarding what action  if any  should be brought by the sec 
we and the officers receiving these notices provided written submissions to the sec in response to the wells notices during december  and may seek a further meeting with the sec staff 
we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of this investigation  nor can a reasonable estimate of the costs that might result from the sec s investigation be made 
responding to this investigation will result in a diversion of management s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees 
we have various insurance policies related to the risk associated with our business  including directors and officers insurance 
however  there is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that our insurance companies will cover the matters claimed

impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas no 
sfas no 
permits companies to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis 
companies electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sfas no 
on our financial statements 
if elected  sfas no 
would be effective as of january  
table of contents in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement 
also in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab no 
sab no 
was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
it requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
the provisions of sab no 
must be applied to annual financial statements no later than the first fiscal year ending after november  we have assessed the effect of adopting this guidance and have determined that there was no impact on our financial statements or related disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin no 
fin no 
prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin no 
and in subsequent periods 
fin no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of fin no 
on our financial statements  however  we do not expect a material impact on our current disclosures due to our current net operating loss position and related valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets 
we adopted sfas no 
r effective january   as required  and have incorporated the modified prospective method for recognizing stock based compensation expense which does not require restated results for prior periods 
under the modified prospective method  stock based compensation cost recognized for the year ended december  includes a stock based compensation cost for all share based payments granted  but not yet vested as of january   based on grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b stock based compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
such amounts are reduced by our estimate of forfeitures of all unvested awards 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab no 
 regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas no 
r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we have applied the provisions of sab no 
in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 and related interpretations for all awards granted to employees 
under apb no 
 when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans equals the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recorded 
when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans is less than the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on january   our net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million greater than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb no 
we estimated the fair value of share based payments granted to employees using the black scholes model and related assumptions  consistent with our fair value estimates made under sfas no 

table of contents as of december   approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our stock options and restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we currently estimate total stock based compensation expense to be approximately million in this estimate is based on the unvested portion of stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of december   our current stock price  and an anticipated level of share based payments granted during  exclusive of the hiring of additional employees needed to support the launch of azasite in should our stock price change significantly from its current level  and or if our anticipated headcount changes  particularly to support an azasite launch  actual stock based compensation expense could change significantly from this projection 
however  the actual amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the future will largely depend on levels of share based payments granted in future periods and changes in our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting of united states government and government agency obligations  money market and mutual fund investments  municipal and corporate notes and bonds and asset or mortgage backed securities 
our portfolio has a current average maturity of less than months  using the stated maturity or reset maturity dates associated with individual maturities as the basis for the calculation 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio  changes in the market value of investments due to changes in interest rates  the increase or decrease in realized gains and losses on investments and the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to various outstanding debt instruments 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited to capital leases  other short term debt obligations and future borrowings under the term loan facility 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities and instruments with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
a hypothetical basis point drop in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
at december   our portfolio of available for sale investments consisted of approximately million of investments maturing within one year and approximately million of investments maturing after one year but within months 
in addition  we have  of our long term investments that are held in a restricted account that collateralizes a letter of credit with a financial institution 
additionally  we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments to maturity and therefore do not expect that our operating results  financial position or cash flows will be affected by a significant amount due to a sudden change in interest rates 
the interest rate on our long term debt is fixed on outstanding borrowings from the term loan facility  but future draws on the facility will be assumed interest based upon current market interest rates at the time of borrow 
assuming other factors are held constant  an increase in interest rates from the fixed rate on our debt generally results in a decrease in the fair value of our long term debt  and a decrease in interest rates generally results in an increase in the fair value of our long term debt 
however  neither an increase nor a decrease in interest rates will impact the carrying value of the long term debt 
as of december   the fair value of our long term debt approximates its carrying value of million 

table of contents strategic investment risk in addition to our normal investment portfolio  we have a strategic investment in parion sciences  inc valued at  as of december  this investment is in the form of unregistered common stock and is subject to higher investment risk than our normal investment portfolio due to the lack of an active resale market for the investment
