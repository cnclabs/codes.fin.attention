except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described in item a 
risk factors 
landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast splints and casts  in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  intelimer packaging technology for the fresh cut and whole produce packaging market  in september  intelimer polymer systems in june that includes polymer materials for various industrial applications and beginning in november for personal care applications  and intellicoat coated corn seeds in the fall of with the acquisition of apio in and landec ag in  the company has focused on two core businesses food products technology and agricultural seed technology 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intelimer packaging technology with apio s fresh cut and whole produce business 
prior to the sale of fcd on december  to asi  the agricultural seed technology segment integrated the intellicoat seed coating technology with fcd s direct marketing  telephone sales and distribution capabilities 
the company also operates a technology licensing research and development business which develops products to be licensed outside of the company s core businesses 
see business description of core business 
from inception through may   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
the company may incur additional losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in future years 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
notes and advances receivables apio has made advances to produce growers for crop and harvesting costs 
typically these advances are paid off within the growing season less than one year from harvested crops 
advances not fully paid during the current growing season are converted to interest bearing obligations  evidenced by contracts and notes receivable 
these notes receivable and advances are secured by liens on land and or crops and have terms that range from twelve to sixty months 
notes receivable are periodically reviewed at least quarterly for collectibility 
a reserve is established for any note or advance deemed to not be fully collectible based upon an estimate of the crop value or the fair value of the security for the note or advance 
if crop prices or the fair value of the underlying security declines  the company may be unable to fully recoup its note or advance receivable and the estimated losses would rise in the current period  potentially to the extent of the total note or advance receivable 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
bad debt losses are partially mitigated due to low risks related to the fact that the company s customers are predominantly large financially sound national and regional retailers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve  based on historical losses  for inventory currently considered to be useable 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  and discounts 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition a replacement of sab  sab 
initial license fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the period of the agreement when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
prior to november   the company recognized noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees as revenue when received and when all significant contractual obligations of the company relating to the fees had been met 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees to recognize such fees over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
the company believes the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in sab in the fiscal year ended october   the company recorded a charge of million related to the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect was initially recorded as deferred revenue and has been recognized as recycled revenue over the research and development period or supply period commitment of the agreement 
recycled revenue refers to revenue that had previously been recognized as licensing revenue in the company s financial statements  but as a result of the company s adoption of sab  was reversed through a cumulative effect of a change in accounting in fiscal year and has been recognized as revenue over the research and development period and or the supply period commitment of the agreement  whichever is longer 
in july  the company amended its supply agreement with alcon  inc alcon to change the expiration date of the agreement from november  to may  in accordance with sab  the entire amount of the deferred revenue of  as of may   was recognized as recycled revenue during fiscal year during the fiscal years ended may   may  and may    and  respectively  of the related deferred revenue was recognized as recycled revenue 
as of may  and may   deferred revenue associated with the change in accounting principles described above is zero 
contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as earned  based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment the company is required to evaluate its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually 
this evaluation incorporates a variety of estimates including the fair value of the company s operating segments 
if the carrying value of an operating segment s assets exceeds the estimated fair value  the company would likely be required to record an impairment loss  possibly for the entire carrying balance of goodwill and intangible assets 
to date  no impairment losses have been incurred 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and  if necessary  adjusts the amount of such allowance 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
due to the company s limited tax basis earnings history  the net deferred tax asset at may  has been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
stock based compensation on may   the company adopted sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
among other items  sfas r requires companies to record compensation expense for stock based awards issued to employees and directors in exchange for services provided 
the amount of the compensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of the awards on their grant dates and is recognized over the required service periods 
the company s stock based awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards rsus 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company applied the intrinsic value method set forth in apb to calculate the compensation expense for stock based awards 
the company has historically set the exercise price for its stock options equal to the market value on the grant date 
as a result  the options had no intrinsic value on their grant dates  and therefore the company did not record any compensation expense unless the terms of the stock options were subsequently modified 
for rsus  the calculation of compensation expense under apb and sfas r is similar except for the accounting treatment for forfeitures as discussed below 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard to i all stock based awards issued on or after may  and ii any outstanding stock based awards that were issued but not vested as of may  accordingly  the company s consolidated financial statements as of may  and may   and for the fiscal years then ended  were accounted for under the provisions of apb the estimated fair value for stock options  which determines the company s calculation of compensation expense  is based on the black scholes pricing model 
upon the adoption of sfas r  the company changed its method of calculating and recognizing the fair value of stock based compensation arrangements to the straight line  single option method 
compensation expense for all stock option and restricted stock awards granted prior to may  will continue to be recognized using the straight line  multiple option method 
in addition  sfas r requires the estimation of the expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the time of grant 
as a result  the company uses historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differ from the prior estimates 
in the pro forma information required under sfas r for periods prior to may   the company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly  does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company has not determined the impact of the adoption of sfas on its consolidated financial statements 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition and defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized 
the provisions of fin no 
will be effective for the company commencing at the start of fiscal  may  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin no 
on its consolidated financial statements  however  the company does not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

landec has pledged substantially all of the assets of apio to secure the line of credit with wells fargo 
at may   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit

landec s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs  the continued development of marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  the ability of landec to establish and maintain new collaborative and licensing arrangements  any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities  weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce  the timing and amount  if any  of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the ability to comply with regulatory requirements  the emergence of competitive technology and market forces  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  and other factors 
if landec s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs  landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to landec on favorable terms if at all 
landec believes that its debt facilities  cash from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and existing borrowing capacities will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements for the foreseeable future
