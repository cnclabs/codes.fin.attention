our service offerings span all commercial property types office  industrial  retail  land  mixed use  hospitality and multifamily 
since  we have expanded the geographical coverage of our existing information services and developed new information services 
in addition to internal growth  this expansion included the acquisitions of chicago resource  inc in chicago in and new market systems  inc in san francisco in in august  we expanded into the houston region through the acquisition of houston based real estate information provider c data services  inc in january  we expanded further into the midwest and florida by acquiring leasetrend  inc and into atlanta and dallas fort worth by acquiring jamison research  inc in february  we acquired comps  a san diego based provider of commercial real estate information 
in november  we acquired first image technologies  inc in september  we expanded further into portland  oregon through the acquisition of certain assets of napier realty advisors d b a real net 
in january  we established a base in the united kingdom with our acquisition of london based property intelligence 
in may  we expanded into tennessee through the acquisition of peer market research  inc  and in september  we extended our coverage of the united kingdom through the acquisition of scottish property network 
in september  we strengthened our position in denver  colorado through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of realcomp  inc  a local comparable sales information provider 
in january  we acquired national research bureau nrb  a leading provider of us shopping center information 
additionally  in december  our uk subsidiary  costar limited  acquired grecam sas grecam located in paris  france  a provider of commercial property information and market level surveys  studies and consulting services 
in february  costar limited also acquired property investment exchange limited propex  a provider of commercial property information and operator of an investment property exchange located in london  england 
the more recent acquisitions are discussed later in this section 
our current expansion plan began in and included entering new metropolitan markets throughout the united states as well as expanding the geographical boundaries of many of our existing us and us markets during and as of february  our expansion into the new markets was complete 
in early we announced the launch of a major effort to expand our coverage of retail real estate information 
the new retail component of our flagship product  costar property professional  was unveiled in may at the international council of shopping centers convention in las vegas 
in july  we announced our intention to commence actively researching commercial properties in approximately new metropolitan statistical areas msas across the united states in an effort to expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings  including our new retail service 
during  in connection with our plan to actively research commercial properties in these new msas  we increased our us field research fleet by adding vehicles and hired researchers to staff these vehicles 
further  in support of our expanded research efforts  we opened a research facility under a short term lease in white marsh  maryland and hired and trained additional researchers and other personnel 
we intend to enter into a long term lease for a new research facility in white marsh  maryland in as a result of our recent acquisitions of propex and grecam  we also intend to invest further in our uk and french operations and to expand the coverage of our service offerings within the uk and france 
costar intends to integrate its uk and french operations more fully with those of the us and eventually to introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings 
our current expansion plan  further geographical expansion into approximately new msas  expansion of coverage of retail real estate information  expansion of our coverage in existing markets and expansion of our uk and french operations  has caused  and will continue to cause  our cost structure to escalate in advance of the revenues that we expect to generate from these new markets and services  which may reduce our earnings or earnings growth 
we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services  expand existing services and coverage across our current markets  expand geographically in the us and international markets  consider strategic acquisitions  and expand our sales and marketing organization 
any future significant expansion could reduce our profitability and significantly increase our capital expenditures 
therefore  while we expect current service offerings in existing markets to remain generally profitable and provide substantial funding for our overall business  it is possible that further overall expansion could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 
we expect revenue to grow over revenue as a result of further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our platform  successful cross selling of our services to our existing customer base  continued geographic expansion and acquisitions 
we expect that ebitda  which is our net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  could increase from based on the growth in ebitda from us operations which will be partially offset by our plan to expand and integrate our uk and french operations 
we anticipate our ebitda for our existing core platform to continue to grow principally due to growth in revenue 
beginning on january   we began accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
upon adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations of approximately  representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in  we issued restricted stock and stock options to our officers  directors and employees  and as a result we recorded additional compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we plan to continue the use of alternative stock based compensation for our officers  directors and employees  which may include  among other things  restricted stock or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations and reduce our net income 
we incurred approximately million in total equity compensation expense in our subscription based information services  consisting primarily of costar property professional  costar tenant  costar comps professional and focus services  currently generate approximately of our total revenues 
our contracts for our subscription based information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically 
upon renewal  many of the subscription contract rates may increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations 
to encourage clients to use our services regularly  we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription based services rather than fees based on actual system usage 
contract rates are based on the number of sites  number of users  organization size  the client s business focus and the number of services to which a client subscribes 
our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis  but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize this revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue  substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 
for the years ended december  and  our contract renewal rate was over 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually on october st of each year for impairment and may be tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 
we measure any impairment loss as the extent to which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
as of the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate taxable income from operations and be able to realize tax benefits arising from use of our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax we will owe on this taxable income 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with these future tax benefits because we were not certain we would generate taxable income in the future 
the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million 
this included an income tax benefit of approximately million that was recognized in our results from operations 
we also recognized a tax benefit of approximately million as additional paid in capital for our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax deductions for stock options 
as of december   we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately  for certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire  if unused  from the year through the year our decision to release the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset was based on our expectation that we will recognize taxable income from operations in the future  which will enable us to use our net operating loss carryforwards 
we believe our expectation that we will recognize taxable income in the future is supported by our increase in net earnings over the last three years  our revenue growth  our renewal rates with our existing customers  and our business model  which permits some control over future costs 
we will continue to evaluate our expectation of future taxable income during each quarter 
if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize the future tax benefits associated with our deferred tax assets  then we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
for the next two years  however  we expect the majority of our taxable income to be offset by our net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  we expect our cash payments for taxes to be limited primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and to state income taxes in certain states 
our uk expansion will generate net operating losses in the uk the loss in the uk will generate a lower tax benefit than if the costs were incurred in the us  thereby creating a higher effective tax rate in effective for fiscal quarters beginning after december   we will adopt the provisions of fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
accounting for employee stock options effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
r accounting for stock based compensation sfas r utilizing the modified prospective approach 
under the modified prospective approach  sfas r applies to new stock based compensation awards and to awards that were outstanding on january   that are subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our share based compensation awards 
this model employs the following key assumptions 
expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical volatility of our stock price  over the expected life of the option 
expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior  the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years 
our stock price volatility and option lives and expected dividends involve management s best estimates at that time  all of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
sfas r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest 
in order to determine the portion of options and stock units expected to vest  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases 
currently  the non gaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda  which is our net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we disclose ebitda in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income loss 
in calculating ebitda we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income loss 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below  in our earnings releases and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 
ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complimentary businesses 
due to the expansion of our information services  which included acquisitions  our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as amortization and depreciation  and non operating items  such as interest and income taxes  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income loss purchase amortization in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the use of our acquired database technology  which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
purchase amortization in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of any acquired tradenames 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of net interest income we generate may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of net interest income to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
income tax expense benefit may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business 
however  we do not consider the amount of income tax expense benefit to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by only using a non gaap measure to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

on january   we acquired the assets of nrb  a leading provider of property information to the shopping center industry  from claritas inc for approximately million in cash 
grecam sas on december   our sas subsidiary  costar limited  acquired grecam  a provider of commercial property information and market level surveys  studies and consulting services  located in paris  france 
we acquired all of the assets of grecam  together with all outstanding capital stock for approximately million in cash 
property investment exchange 
on february   costar limited  a wholly owned uk subsidiary of costar  acquired all outstanding capital stock of propex  a uk company  from the shareholders of propex pursuant to a stock purchase agreement in exchange for consideration of approximately  approximately million  consisting of cash and  shares of costar common stock 
the purchase price is subject to decrease based on propex s net worth as of the closing date 
propex provides web based commercial property information and operates an electronic platform that facilitates the exchange of investment property in the uk its suite of electronic platforms and listing websites give users access to the uk commercial property investment and leasing markets 
accounting treatment 
all of the acquisitions discussed above have been accounted for using purchase accounting 
the purchase price for each of the acquisitions was allocated primarily to acquired database technology  customer base and goodwill 
the acquired database technology for each acquisition is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
the customer base for each acquisition  which consists of one distinct intangible asset composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships  is being amortized on a declining balance method over years 
goodwill will not be amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests 
the results of operations of nrb and grecam have been consolidated with our results since the respective dates of acquisition 
the operating results of each of nrb and grecam are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements  and accordingly  pro forma financial information has not been presented for any of the acquisitions 
costar currently operates within one business segment 
due to the purchase of grecam in december of  the purchase of propex in february of and the company s plan to expand the uk operations in  the company will operate in more than one segment in liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased principally as a result of ebitda  interest income  and proceeds from exercise of stock options  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and other assets  cash used for the purchase of grecam  and changes in working capital accounts 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to increased earnings before non cash charges for taxes  stock based compensation  provision for losses on accounts receivable  depreciation and amortization  partially offset by the net effect of changes in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to decreased net purchases and sales of short term investments and less cash used in acquisitions  partially offset by increased purchases of property and equipment and other assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the lower net cash produced by financing activities in compared to is due to a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands and total thereafter operating leases purchase obligations total contractual principal cash obligations amounts do not include current purchase obligations that may be renewed on the same or different terms or terminated by us or a third party 
during  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million  including expenditures of approximately million related to building photography costs and the purchase of field research vehicles and equipment in connection with our intention to actively research commercial properties in approximately new msa s across the united states  and the remaining million related to costs of supporting our existing operations 
we expect to make capital expenditures in totaling approximately million including significant investments in expansion facilities  building photography  network equipment and workstations to support expansion and ongoing operations 
this estimate also includes to million in capital expenditures for the company s uk operations 
to date  we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions 
our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations 
we expect to use cash  stock  debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 
based on current plans  we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
as of the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate taxable income from operations and be able to realize tax benefits arising from use of our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax we will owe on this taxable income 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with these future tax benefits because we were not certain we would generate taxable income in the future 
the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million 
this included an income tax benefit of approximately million that was recognized in our results from operations 
we also recognized a tax benefit of approximately million as additional paid in capital for our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax deductions for stock options 
as of december   we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately  for certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire  if unused  from the year through the year for the next two years  however  we expect the majority of our taxable income to be absorbed by our net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  we expect our cash payments for taxes to be limited primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and to state income taxes in certain states 
inflation may affect the way we operate in the us and abroad 
in general  we believe that over time we are able to increase the prices of our services to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs 
we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations  and we do not anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on our operations in recent accounting pronouncements we initially adopted the emerging issues task force eitf consensus on issue no

we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
