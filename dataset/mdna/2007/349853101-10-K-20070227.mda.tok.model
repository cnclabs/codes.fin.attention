item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and executive summary we are a leading provider of time definite surface transportation and related logistics services to the north american deferred air freight market 
we offer our customers scheduled surface transportation of cargo as a cost effective  reliable alternative to air transportation 
we transport cargo that must be delivered at a specific time  but is less time sensitive than traditional air freight 
this type of cargo is frequently referred to in the transportation industry as deferred air freight 
we operate through a network of terminals located on or near airports in the united states and canada  including a central sorting facility in columbus  ohio and nine regional hubs serving key markets 
in addition  during we introduced our new pick up and delivery service called forward air complete whereby we arrange for cargo to be picked up from and or delivered to a customer designated site 
through offering forward air complete we expect to increase tonnage through our network by attracting new customers or shipments from existing customers that require door to door service 
revenue from the roll out of forward air complete was million during the year ended december trends and developments during the year ended december  our logistics business experienced significant growth while the growth rate for our airport to airport business slowed over the last half of the year 
the growth rate of our logistics business is driven by our added capacity and continuing efforts to promote and expand the business  as well as by our enhanced technology 
during the year ended december   the one year anniversary of our may  acquisition of certain assets of us xpress enterprises  inc usx occurred bringing an anticipated slowing of the airport to airport tonnage and revenue growth 
in anticipation of this slowing  we began a number of initiatives focused on continued growth of our airport to airport business as well as overall revenue growth 
these initiatives include the implementation of forward air complete  our partnership with dhl global forwarding to be their primary ground transportation provider and new strategic business initiatives with united airlines and pilot air freight 
also  during the year ended december  we completed a project to expand our national hub in columbus  ohio 
the new expanded columbus  ohio facility is  square feet with trailer doors 
this premier facility can unload  sort and load upwards of million pounds in five hours 
in addition to the expansion  we process engineered the freight sorting in the expanded building to improve handling efficiencies 
the benefits will include reductions in the distance each shipment moves in the building to speed up the transfer process  less handling of freight to further improve service integrity and flexibility to operate multiple sorts at the same time 
risk factors a summary of factors which could affect results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us  or on our behalf  are further described under the caption risk factors in the business portion of our form k

the increase in airport to airport revenue was driven by an increase in tonnage and an increase in average revenue per pound 
tonnage that transited our network increased by in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the increase in tonnage is a result of positive trends among our customer base and the acquisition of certain assets of usx on may  these positive trends were offset by a decline in shipping demand during the last half of  as demonstrated by the decline in our average weight per shipment  despite a increase in total shipments 
our airport to airport business is priced on a per pound basis and the average revenue per pound  including the impact of fuel surcharges  increased for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  average revenue per pound increased primarily as a result of rate increases implemented in march and increased fuel surcharges to offset rising fuel costs 
our logistics revenue  which is primarily truckload brokerage and priced on a per mile basis  increased million  or  to million  accounting for of our total operating revenue during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  logistics revenue increased despite the loss of a significant customer in the second half of who accounted for approximately million in logistics revenue during the year ended december  the increase in logistics revenue is primarily attributable to our ability to capture a larger percentage of truckload opportunities as a result of our increased access to sufficient capacity through third party transportation providers 
during the year ended december   we increased the number of miles driven to support our logistics revenue by 
the increase in miles driven is a result of our continued efforts to grow our logistics business and obtain additional customers 
the average revenue per mile of our logistics business  including the impact of fuel surcharges  decreased for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  the decrease in our revenue per mile is primarily a result of a change in the mix of business offset by increased fuel surcharges to offset rising fuel costs 
accessorial revenue  which includes forward air complete  warehousing services and terminal handling and accounts for our final component of operating revenue  increased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in accessorial revenue is attributable to the introduction of forward air complete and increases in other accessorial charges for special shipping needs  offset by decreases in terminal handling fees due to the customer loss discussed in logistics revenue 

table of contents purchased transportation increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in purchased transportation is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in miles driven and an approximate increase in the total cost per mile for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  as a percentage of total operating revenue  purchased transportation increased to during the year ended december  compared to in the same period of for the year ended december   purchased transportation costs for our airport to airport network decreased to of airport to airport revenue for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  the proportionate improvement resulted from better load factors  or more revenue per mile  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus for the year ended december  the increase resulted from lower logistics revenue per mile discussed above and a increase in our logistics cost per mile 
logistics cost per mile increased as a result of the use of more third party transportation providers as opposed to our less costly fleet of owner operators offset by lower third party transportation provider rates due to our increased capacity and utilization 
accessorial purchased transportation costs as a percentage of accessorial revenue increased to of accessorial revenue for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to a change in the revenue mix resulting from the implementation of forward air complete and the customer loss discussed in the analysis of logistics revenue 
salaries  wages and employee benefits were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the same period of the decrease in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue is attributable to operating efficiencies gained during the year 
salaries and wages  including payroll taxes  and workers compensation insurance and expenses  which increased by million  or  declined as a percentage of revenue 
salaries and wages and workers compensation insurance and expenses increased to meet the additional demands of the increased tonnage through our network and increased logistics and other services provided to our customers  but declined as a percentage of revenue due to operating efficiencies gained during the year as a result of tap and other management initiatives 
this decrease as a percentage of revenue was offset by a million  or as a percentage of operating revenue  increase in health care costs due to increased participants in our health care plan  as well as a larger number of high dollar claims 
also  during we implemented statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas r  and issued non vested shares of common stock to certain key employees 
as a result we recognized million  or of operating revenue  in share based compensation that is included in salaries  wages and employee benefits for the year ended december  however  this increase was offset by the year ended december  including a million dollar  or of operating revenue  charge resulting from the decision by our board of directors to accelerate the vesting of all of our outstanding and unvested stock options to employees  officers and non employee directors in the fourth quarter of operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in operating leases as a percentage of operating revenue was attributable to the increase in operating revenue as operating lease expenses increased million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the increase is attributable to expansion of certain facilities resulting in higher facility rent 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december  and the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was attributable to the increase in operating revenue as depreciation and amortization remained consistent year over year 
depreciation decreased million year over year due to the year ended december  including increased depreciation from the accelerated depreciation of trailers sold in the third and fourth quarters of also  depreciation decreased million due to several assets becoming fully depreciated during these decreases were offset by amortization expense increasing during the year ended december  by million  or by five additional months of amortization  due to the purchase of certain assets of usx on may  the decreases were also offset by increased depreciation on new trailers and tractors purchased during late and  as well the depreciation on our new tap system which was fully implemented during insurance and claims were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  
the increase in insurance and claims is primarily the result of higher insurance premiums  offset by improved claims experience during the year ended december  additionally  during the year ended december   an independent third party performed an actuary study of our loss development factor for vehicle liability claims 
the results of the study caused us to lower our loss development reserve for vehicle liability claims 

table of contents other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was attributable to the increase in operating revenue as other operating expenses increased million  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the million increase in other operating expenses is primarily attributable to a million decrease in the gain on the sale of trailers due to the replacement of approximately half of the trailers in our fleet during the remaining increase in total other operating expenses is attributable to increases in volume related operating expenses  such as fuel  tires  and station handling fees 
income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the increase in income from operations was primarily a result of the increase in operating revenue and operating expenses decreasing as a percentage of revenue 
other income  net was million  or of operating revenue  for the year ended december  compared with million  or of operating revenue  for the year ended december  the decrease in other income in total dollars and as a percentage of operating revenue was attributable to the year ended december  including the million gain from our lawsuit settlement with the city of atlanta regarding property we owned adjacent to the atlanta hartsfield jackson international airport 
this decrease was offset by higher interest income earned during the year ended december  due to higher yields and average investment balances 
the decrease was further offset by including a million gain on the recovery of escrow funds related to a asset purchase 
the combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in tax exempt interest income as a percentage of our total income before taxes 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million in airport to airport  which is the largest component of our operating revenue  increased million to million  accounting for of our total operating revenue 
the increase in airport to airport revenue was driven  in part  by the acquisition of certain assets of usx in the second quarter of during  we experienced an increase in tonnage that transited our network as the result of a stronger economy and positive trends among our customer base 
our airport to airport business is priced on a per pound basis and the average revenue per pound including the impact of fuel surcharges increased for versus primarily as the result of a rate increase implemented during the year 
our logistics revenue  which is primarily truckload brokerage and priced on a per mile basis  increased million to million in during the year  we decreased the number of miles driven to support our logistics revenue by while increasing the revenue per mile including the impact of fuel surcharges charged by 
accessorial revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling and accounts for our final component of operating revenue  decreased million to million  a decrease from purchased transportation decreased to of operating revenue in versus in the same period of the decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily attributed to a year over year improvement in tonnage transported through the airport to airport network and revenue per pound that allowed us to operate our network more efficiently in versus during the year  we increased the amount we spent for purchased transportation by million  an increase of 
for  purchased transportation costs for our airport to airport network represented of airport to airport revenue versus in during this period  we were able to increase both the volume and revenue per pound of freight  which enabled us to operate the airport to airport network more efficiently 
these increases were offset  in part  by an increase in the number of miles needed to operate our system as well as an increase in the average rate per mile paid 
for  logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus last year 
salaries  wages and employee benefits were of operating revenue in compared to for the same period of the decrease in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily attributed to a year over year improvement in operating revenue that allowed us to operate our network more efficiently in versus this includes a million dollar  or of operating revenue  charge resulting from the decision to accelerate the vesting of common stock options in the fourth quarter of additionally  as a percentage of revenue  the amounts spent on health care decreased  offset by a increase in workers compensation expenses 
operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of operating revenue in compared to in the same period of the decrease in operating leases as a percentage of operating revenue between periods was primarily attributable to an increase in operating revenue as the dollar amount in this category increased between the two periods 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was in compared to in the same period of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was partially attributable to an increase in amortization associated with the purchase of certain intangible assets from usx 
additionally  there was increased depreciation resulting from the accelerated depreciation of trailers sold during the third and fourth quarters 
insurance and claims were of operating revenue in compared to in the same period of the decrease as a percentage of operating revenue was driven by an increase in operating revenue as insurance expenses and claims expenses as a percentage of operating revenue decreased by and  respectively 
we are self insured for each auto liability claim in the amount of  other operating expenses were of operating revenue in compared to in the same period of other operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue decreased primarily as the result of a gain from the sale of trailers  as well as a decrease in corporate expenses 
these decreases were offset  in part  by a increase in terminal and operating expenses 
income from operations increased by million  or  to million for compared with million for the same period in the increase in income from operations was primarily a result of the increase in operating revenue  including fuel surcharges  which was offset in part by increases in variable costs associated with operating the network

the remaining increase in other income  net resulted from higher interest income attributed to higher yields on balances in available for sale securities during the combined federal and state effective tax rate for was of pre tax income compared to a rate of for the same period in as a result of the foregoing factors  net income increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the same period in discussion of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continuously evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to collectibility of accounts receivable  self insurance loss reserves  income taxes  share based compensation  and valuation of goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our financial position and results of operations may be significantly different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example  bankruptcy filings or accounts turned over for collection or litigation  we record a specific reserve for these bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for these bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
specifically  amounts that are days or more past due are reserved at 
if circumstances change ie  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
accounts are written off after all means of collection  including legal action  have been exhausted 

table of contents allowance for revenue adjustments our allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise i when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  ii when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  iii when billing errors occur  and iv when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
we monitor the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised and that fraud does not occur 
during  average revenue adjustments per month were approximately million  on average revenue per month of approximately million less than of monthly revenue 
in order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable  we prepare an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying these revenue adjustments 
based on this analysis  we establish an allowance for approximately days dependent upon experience in the last twelve months of average revenue adjustments  adjusted for rebates and billing errors 
the lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience 
additionally  the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted 
both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity 
self insurance loss reserves given the nature of our operating environment  we are subject to vehicle and general liability  workers compensation and health insurance claims 
to mitigate a portion of these risks  we maintain insurance for individual vehicle and general liability claims exceeding million and workers compensation claims and health insurance claims exceeding approximately million  except in ohio  where we are a qualified self insured with an approximately million self insured retention 
the amount of self insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process for self insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends  management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management also monitors the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year s estimation process referred to as a hindsight analysis and adjusts current year assumptions based on the hindsight analysis 
additionally  we utilize an actuary to evaluate open vehicle liability claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we conduct an annual impairment test of goodwill at the end of the second quarter of each year based on judgments regarding the market value of our common stock  ongoing profitability and cash flow of the underlying assets 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believe is impaired 
the annual impairment test was conducted and it did not result in any impairment charges 
share based compensation prior to january   as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we accounted for share based payments to employees using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
as such  we generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options as options granted had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock paid by employees was not less than of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning and at the end of each purchase period 

table of contents effective january   we adopted sfas r and elected the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased or canceled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
share based awards that are granted prior to the effective date should continue to be valued in accordance with sfas and stock option expense for unvested options must be recognized in the statement of operations 
on december   our board of directors accelerated the vesting of all of our outstanding and unvested stock options awarded to employees  officers and non employee directors under our stock option award plans 
as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of our outstanding and unvested options in  there was no additional compensation expense recognized during the year ended december  related to options granted prior to january  prior to the implementation of sfas r  we utilized stock options as our sole form of share based awards 
during the year ended december   we granted non vested shares of common stock non vested shares to key employees 
the non vested shares fair values were estimated using opening market prices for the business day of the grant 
the share based compensation for the non vested shares is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period  or vesting period  of three years 
forfeitures have been estimated based on our historical experience  but will be adjusted for future changes in forfeiture experience 
we estimate the forfeitures of dividends paid on non vested shares and record expense for the estimated forfeitures in accordance with sfas r 
under the espp  which has been approved by shareholders  we are authorized to issue shares of common stock to our employees 
these shares may be issued at a price equal to of the lesser of the market value on the first day or the last day of each six month purchase period 
common stock purchases are paid for through periodic payroll deductions and or up to two large lump sum contributions 
as the espp does not qualify as non compensatory under the requirements of sfas r  we recognize share based compensation on the date of purchase based on the difference between the purchase date fair market value and the employee purchase price 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented all tax benefits for tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows on our statements of cash flows 
sfas r requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits for tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recorded for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
accordingly  we classified excess tax benefits as financing cash inflows rather than as operating cash inflows on our statement of cash flows for the year ended december  sfas r also requires companies to calculate an initial pool of excess tax benefits available at the adoption date to absorb any unused deferred tax assets that may be recognized under sfas r 
the pool includes the net excess tax benefits that would have been recognized if we had adopted sfas for recognition purposes on its effective date 
we have elected to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits under the alternative transition method described in financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  which also specifies the method we must use to calculate excess tax benefits reported on the statement of cash flows 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements during june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which is effective for us on january  this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the guidance prescribed in fin establishes a recognition threshold of more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
the measurement attribute of fin requires that a tax position be measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements as a result of on going litigation between taxing authorities and entities that are not related to us in certain tax jurisdictions in which we file 
the results of this litigation may materially impact the financial statement recognition of tax positions taken in certain state income tax returns 
upon initial adoption  as specified by fin any required cumulative effect adjustment will be charged to retained earnings 
during september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  with early adoption encouraged 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  the application of sfas could change current practice 
we plan to adopt sfas on january   but the implementation of sfas is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our working capital needs  including capital purchases  with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank line of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million in the same period of the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily generated from the increase in our net income and decreases in our income taxes receivable 
these increases were offset by the reclassification of cash provided by tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recorded for options  which due to the implementation of sfas r is now recorded in financing cash flows 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million provided by investing activities in the same period of investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase and sale or maturities of available for sale securities  payments and deposits for expanded or new facilities and the purchase of operating equipment and management information systems during the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by investing activities was the result of a million decrease in net cash provided by the sale and purchasing of available for sale securities 
also  the year ended december  included million in cash provided by the settlement of our lawsuit with the city of atlanta regarding property we owned adjacent to the atlanta hartsfield jackson international airport 
these decreases in cash provided were offset by million in cash used for the acquisition of usx during the year ended december  additionally  cash paid for capital expenditures and deposits  net of proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment  decreased million 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in financing activities for the same period of the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a million decrease in cash used for the repurchase of our common stock 
also  cash used for financing activities improved due to the implementation of sfas r and the million benefit resulting from the requirement to classify tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recorded for options as financing cash flows as opposed to operating cash flows 
offsetting these improvements in cash flow  during the year ended december  we received approximately million less in proceeds from the exercise of stock options than during in addition  positive movements in cash used in financing activities were offset by a million increase in cash dividends paid  a million decrease in borrowings from our line of credit and a million increase in payments on our line of credit
