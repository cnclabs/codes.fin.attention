item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we provide intelligent robotics systems  the core of which are our motion controls systems and application software  which are generally sold in combination with our own vision guidance technology and or our third parties robot mechanisms 
our vision guidance technology is tightly integrated with our motion controls technology  and this is a key differentiator for adept 
in addition  we provide robotics services and support for both our own customers and the installed base of other third party providers 
we sell our robotics systems and services into a few broad industries where we believe we can provide the best solutions for particular applications 
through sales to systems integrators  original equipment manufacturer oem partners and end user companies  we provide specialized  cost effective robotics systems and services to markets including high speed packaged goods  life sciences  disk drive electronics and semiconductor  as well as to traditional industrial markets  including machine tool automation and automotive electronics 
sales by industry product revenues by industry for the two most recent fiscal years are shown in the table below year ended june  year ended june  consumer and computer electronics includes disk drive electronics semiconductor machine and industrial automation automotive electronics food  consumer goods and medical includes packaging life sciences oem and other product revenue is comprised of sales of new systems  components  software and parts  and excludes revenue from training  consulting  and field service activities such as maintenance  repair  and system modifications 
oem and other industry revenue includes sales to oems as well as sales related to industrial robot applications 
mix of products sold varies considerably from period to period due to a variety of market and economic factors 
over the last several quarters  we have released new products to address emerging market requirements 
to serve the increasing demand for flexible automation systems to address new automation needs in the medical device  cosmetics and customer goods industries  we introduced motionblox r  a smaller version of our motionblox controller that supports a wider range of automation system configurations 
we introduced clean room versions of our cobra axis robots  and we launched quattro  a powerful new robot mechanism targeted at the global market for high speed automated packaging and part picking applications in the food  consumer goods  cosmetics and pharmaceutical sectors 
finally  we launched the adept viper s  a axis articulated robot with a broader reach and higher payload capability than previous adept products  targeted at applications such as material handling  packaging  machine tending  and other operations requiring fast and precise automation 
over the last three years  we have focused on a three part strategy expand our european market presence  establish a vertical market business  and extend our global service offerings to support third party robot installations in various automation environments 
in recent months we have concluded that an emphasis on growing revenues through service offerings  particularly services related to non adept branded robots  is no longer appropriate  as margins in this business are below our desired levels 
instead  we are intensifying our focus on the european market and on high growth target vertical markets including packaged goods  life sciences  disk drive electronics and semiconductor 
in addition  we are targeting increased sales in the asian disk drive industry through local contact with asian manufacturers  rather than exclusively through us suppliers to those manufacturers  which has been a past area of focus for us 

table of contents over the last several quarters we have experienced a significant decline in our revenues due to reduced demand from customers in the disk drive industry  where capital spending has been deferred for several quarters due to the consolidation of disk drive and component companies over the past months 
we believe that demand in this market will begin to increase once the integration of the consolidated companies is completed 
however  capital spending in the disk drive market may not grow quickly or predictably and our sales to this market may not return to their former levels 
in the last several quarters we have also experienced weakness in some of our traditional automation markets in the us  including automotive electronics and industrial automation 
at the same time  demand for automation solutions for the industrial and automotive sectors in germany has remained robust and largely offset declines in these markets in the us in fiscal in our more recently targeted industries of food  pharmaceutical and other packaged goods  the introduction of our quattro robot in late fiscal appears to have resulted in increased demand  which we believe will continue in fiscal during the past three years  international sales generally have comprised between and of our total revenues for any given quarter  and represented approximately of our total revenues for fiscal in recognition of the increasingly importance of our international business  in late fiscal we announced a new global vertical market business initiative designed to leverage the dynamics of specific vertical markets within particular geographic regions 
our vertical market initiative focuses resources initially on developing applications for western european and us customers in the automotive electronics  food and consumer goods packaging  medical device  lab diagnostics and other medical markets  and for asian customers in the consumer electronics and disk drive markets 
we are working directly with leading customers in these vertical markets  providing direct sales  service and engineering to develop more targeted products and applications 
by being involved directly with the end users during their product planning phase  rather than learning about the end users project after planning has been completed  we believe we have been more successful having our products included in the final design specifications for customers production and assembly lines 
over the last three years  adept has taken a series of steps to strengthen our operational performance and to enhance our ability to serve our customers in europe and in asia 
beginning in we moved a portion of our manufacturing operations to dortmund  germany to better address the european market 
over the last three years we have also implemented a more flexible supply chain and expanded our field capabilities for both sales and services 
the primary focus of the supply chain and field initiatives is to provide more local focus regionally  so that we are able to ship product more quickly  respond in the local language of our customer and provide better support through the sales and service cycles to our customers 
in addition  at the end of fiscal we initiated a restructuring pf our business to reduce facility and headcount costs  consolidate development activities at fewer locations and realign our us sales resources around our target vertical markets 
as a consequence  we have reduced our quarterly expense rate by a significant amount  which we believe will begin to have a positive effect on our operations beginning in our second quarter of fiscal and which we believe will help us to achieve and maintain profitability in the future 
we completed a one for five reverse stock split on february  all current and historical share and per share information in this annual report on form k reflects the results of the reverse stock split 
further  in june  adept completed an equity financing with net proceeds of approximately million 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flow during the three year period ended june   each year therein referred to as fiscal   and unless otherwise indicated  references to any year in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to our fiscal year ended june this discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and financial statement footnotes included in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of adept s financial condition and results of operations are based upon adept s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted 
table of contents accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to fixed price contracts  product returns  warranty obligations  bad debt  inventories  cancellation costs associated with long term commitments  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring expenses  service contracts  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates and judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgment and available information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  and it is possible that such changes could occur in the near term 
reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to present the financial statements on a consistent basis with current year presentation 
such reclassifications have not changed previously reported net income loss or stockholders equity 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our consolidated financial statements while considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
these critical accounting policies described below include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  warranties  capitalization of software development costs  deferred tax valuation allowance  foreign currency translation gain loss  long lived assets and goodwill  and valuation of stock based awards revenue recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of production automation equipment and parts  and to a lesser extent from support and service activities associated with this equipment 
non software product revenue consists primarily of sales of robots  refurbished robots and spare parts 
we recognize non software product revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  when persuasive evidence of a non cancelable arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  legal title and economic risk is transferred to the customer  and when an economic exchange has taken place 
we use the signed purchase contract or purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
product revenues are normally recognized at the point of shipment from adept facilities since title and risk of loss passes to the customers at that time 
customers have no right of return other than for product defects covered by our warranty 
adept maintains a warranty liability based on its historical warranty experience and managements best estimate of adept s warranty liability at each balance sheet date 
there are no acceptance criteria on our standard non software products 
we do not deem the fee to be fixed or determinable where a significant portion of the price is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from the invoice date 
in these cases  if all of the other conditions referred to above are met  we recognize the revenue as the 
table of contents invoice becomes due 
in recording revenue  management exercises judgment about the collectibility of receivables based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if we conclude that collection is not reasonably assured  then the revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed  generally upon receipt of payment 
our experience is that we have been able to reliably determine whether collection is reasonably assured 
adept sells two separate and distinct categories of software software elements within adept s robot and controller products  and standalone software consisting primarily of hexsight  a library of machine vision software tools 
the software elements within adept s products are not sold separately nor are they marketed as separate product offerings to our customers 
our robots and controllers have features that are enabled or enhanced through the use of the software enabling tools and other software elements 
our software enabling tools or other software elements do not operate independently of the robots or controllers  and they are not sold separately and cannot be used without the robots or controllers 
adept believes that the software component of our products is incidental to our products and services taken as a whole 
as a result  we recognize software revenue related to product sales in accordance with sab we recognize stand alone software revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  and software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  iv collectibility is probable and v the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
license revenue is recognized on shipment of the product provided that no significant vendor or post contract support obligations remain and that collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable by management 
insignificant vendor and post contract support obligations are accrued upon shipment of the licensed product 
for software that is installed and integrated by the customer  revenue is recognized upon shipment assuming functionality has already been proven in prior sales and there are no customizations that would cause a substantial acceptance risk 
service and support revenue consists primarily of sales of spare parts and refurbished robots 
service revenue also includes training  consulting and customer support  the latter of which includes all field service activities  ie  maintenance  repairs  system modifications or upgrades 
revenues from training and consulting are recognized at the time the service is performed and the customer has accepted the work 
these revenues are not essential to the product functionality and  therefore  do not bear on revenue recognition policy for adept s component products 
deferred revenues represent payments received from customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services  or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements enumerated above  as well as cases in which we have invoiced the customer but cannot yet recognize the revenue for the same reasons discussed above 
revenue for robot refurbishment relates to adept owned or customer owned remanufactured robots and components 
adept receives parts returned from customers under warranty contracts  or adept purchases surplus used parts available from customers or suppliers 
these parts traditionally have lower cost  and internal analysis indicates that on average  we pay a percentage of the new part cost to acquire these components 
the standard cost for acquired parts is therefore set at such percentage of cost in compliance with gaap as reflected in the sab pronouncement requiring valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market 
by contrast  the cost basis starting point for customer owned remanufactured or repaired robots is zero since adept does not own the robots 
for all refurbishment and remanufacturing  we track all related costs and activities material and labor required to bring the robots up to standard using work orders 
this revenue stream is included within the services and support segment 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and creditworthiness of the 
table of contents customer 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for doubtful accounts 
adept performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not generally request collateral from our customers 
however  adept may require customers to make payments in advance of shipment or provide a letter of credit under certain circumstances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our policy is to record specific allowances against known doubtful accounts 
an additional allowance is also calculated based on the greater of of consolidated accounts receivable or of consolidated accounts receivable more than days past due 
specific allowances are netted out of the respective receivable balances for purposes of calculating this additional allowance 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers and  should the default rate change or the financial positions of our customers change  we may increase this additional allowance percentage 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost under the first in  first out method  or market value 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes  among other factors  a review of component demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans  and quality issues 
as a result of this assessment  we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated liquidation value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
manufacturing inventory includes raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
all work in process inventories with work orders that are open in excess of days are fully written down 
the remaining inventory valuation provisions are based on an excess and obsolete systems report  which captures all obsolete parts and products and all other inventory  which have quantities on hand in excess of one year s projected demand 
individual line item exceptions are identified for either inclusion or exclusion from the inventory valuation provision 
the materials control group and cost accounting function monitor the line item exceptions and make periodic adjustments as necessary 
warranties 
our warranty policy is included in our terms of sale  generally as a two year parts and one year labor limited warranty on most hardware and component products  and states that there are no rights of return  and that a refund may be made at adept s discretion  and only if there is an identified fault in the product and the customer has complied with adept s approved maintenance schedules and procedures  and the product has not been subject to abuse 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and costs per claim for repair or replacement 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our components suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service labor and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  service labor or delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
capitalization of software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we begin capitalizing software development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility  which is established upon the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
costs incurred prior to technological feasibility are charged to expense as incurred 
capitalization ceases when the product is considered available for general release to customers 
capitalized software development costs are amortized to costs of revenues over the estimated economic lives of the software products based on product life expectancy 
generally  estimated economic lives of the software products do not exceed three years 

table of contents deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we have a net deferred tax asset and determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period that such determination was made 
foreign currency translation gain loss 
adept applies sfas  foreign currency translation  with respect to our international operations  which include manufacturing  sales and service entities 
prior to fiscal  adept s non us operations used the non us dollar as the functional currency 
effective july   each of our non us operations uses its respective local currency as the functional currency  based on the determination that our expansion of our international operations in terms of size and function had changed the economic environment of each of the non u 
s operations by one or more factors  and that in each of these environments it is now more appropriate for the local currency to be the functional currency 
in europe  we are now manufacturing locally and thereby incurring a greater part of our costs and expenses in the local currency 
singapore has become our asian headquarters with a growing local staff incurring a greater percentage of local currency expenses 
as a result  our foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operations are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we do not currently apply a hedging strategy against our currency positions as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
long lived assets and goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment with respect to future sales and production volumes  revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital use  foreign exchange rates and selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit 
an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we test our intangible assets annually on april unless there are indications during an interim period that such assets may have become impaired 
we use our judgment in assessing whether intangible assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities may signal that an intangible asset has become impaired 
in fiscal  in management s exercise of its judgment  adept concluded that the carrying value of goodwill related to the acquisitions of hexavision and meta was not supportable because the estimate of future cash flows related to these intangible assets was not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such intangibles 
accordingly  the company wrote down the entire value of goodwill related to these acquisitions and took a charge of million under sfas no 
for intangible asset impairment 
valuation of stock based awards 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period of the individual equity instrument 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes calculation for option grants is based on historical volatility as options on our stock are not traded 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar 
table of contents vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
acquisitions from time to time  we may make acquisitions of products  technologies or other businesses 
we have not consummated any such acquisition in the past four fiscal years  but continue to evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions 
in fiscal  we acquired a ownership interest in meta control technologies  inc meta  a provider of automation solutions  with the remaining ownership interest in meta being held in escrow for the benefit of one stockholder 
the acquisition agreement provides that adept will acquire all of these remaining shares in return for the provision of discounts and royalty payments to the stockholder and its affiliates of up to million through august but will  in any event and regardless of whether discounts are incurred or royalties paid  acquire of the stock of meta no later than august for no additional consideration 
such amounts will be charged to operations when incurred 
management has decided to discontinue selling meta products in fiscal  other than a last time buy opportunity for the remaining customer for those products 
as a result of this decision to discontinue sales of all meta products  management has determined the entire amount of goodwill related to the acquisition of meta is fully impaired 
results of operations revenues the following table sets forth our annual revenues and year to year change in revenues by business segment for the fiscal years ended june   and fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenue by segment robotics revenues percentage of total revenues services and support revenues percentage of total revenues total revenues fiscal revenue compared with fiscal revenue revenues decreased million  or  to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in revenue was attributable to a decrease in revenues from our robotics segment and a decrease in revenues from our service and support segment 
robotics segment revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   down from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in robotics revenues was primarily due to reduced demand from the disk drive and consumer electronics market  where capital spending has been deferred for several quarters due to the mergers of two competing disk drive manufacturers 
in addition  revenues from the life sciences sector were lower in fiscal  primarily because in fiscal  we recorded an atypically large order from a us pharmaceutical customer to fulfill a very large order for one of its end users  and we received no comparably large order in fiscal finally  demand from the industrial and automotive markets remained weak in fiscal 
table of contents services and support segment revenues were million for fiscal  down from million for fiscal the decrease is attributable to lower sales of remanufactured robotics to disk drive and consumer electronics manufacturers in the us and asia 
during fiscal  we concluded that an emphasis on growing revenues through service offerings  particularly services related to non adept branded robots  is no longer appropriate  as margins in this business are below our desired levels 
instead  we are intensifying our focus on the european market and on high growth target vertical markets including packaged goods  life sciences  disk drive electronics and semiconductor  including increasing sales in the asian disk drive industry through local contacts  but these developments had very limited impact on our fiscal revenues 
during fiscal  revenue declined due to reduced demand from customers in the disk drive industry  where capital spending has been deferred for several quarters due to the consolidation of disk drive and component companies over the past to months 
we believe that demand in this market will begin to increase once the integration of the consolidated companies is completed 
however  capital spending in the disk drive market may not grow quickly or predictably and our sales to this market may not return to their former levels 
during fiscal we also experienced continued weakness in some of our traditional automation markets in the us  including automotive electronics and industrial automation 
at the same time  as discussed below  demand for automation solutions for the industrial and automotive sectors in germany has remained robust and largely offset declines in these markets in the us in fiscal our late fiscal introduction of our quattro robot appears to have resulted in increased demand in our target industries of consumer goods  pharmaceutical and other packaged goods  which we believe will continue in fiscal fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenue by geography united states revenues percentage of total revenues europe revenues percentage of total revenues asia revenues percentage of total revenues other countries revenues percentage of total revenues total international revenues percentage of total revenues total revenues our domestic sales were million in fiscal  a decrease of compared to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to reduced sales of both new robotic systems and refurbished robots to the disk drive industry 
a significant proportion of our us revenue is comprised of product sales for end user customers actually located in asia and europe although our point of sale is within the us therefore the decline in the us also reflects a decline in asian customer installations 
in addition  revenues from the life sciences sector were lower in fiscal  primarily because in fiscal we recorded an atypically large order from a us pharmaceutical customer to fulfill a very large order for one of its end users  and we received no comparably large order in fiscal finally  demand from the industrial and automotive markets remained 
table of contents weak in fiscal demand from the industrial and automotive markets continued to be strong in germany  however  and were the primary reason for a increase in european sales  to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal asia sales decreased in fiscal to million  compared with million in fiscal  reflecting weakness in the disk drive market as noted above 
total international sales were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
fiscal revenue compared with fiscal revenue revenues increased million  or  to million for as compared to million for the increase in revenue was attributable to a increase in revenues from our services and support segment and a increase in revenues from our robotics segment 
robotics segment revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   up from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase resulted primarily from increased sales of our line of cobra robots and  to a lesser extent  sales of our new adeptviper axis robot and adeptpython linear modules  partially offset by reduced revenues from vision software 
services and support segment revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   up from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase is attributable to services involved in the redeployment and refurbishing of existing customer equipment and sales to customers of remanufactured robotics  with strong demand from the disk drive industry and redeployment of production lines by our customers to plants in china and malaysia 
our domestic sales were million in fiscal  an increase of compared to million in fiscal this increase was due both to the increase in robot mechanism refurbishment we experienced in our service business  which is primarily in the us  as well as increased demand from us based multinational integrators and oems for products to serve their offshore clients 
a significant proportion of our us revenues therefore reflect product sales for end user customers actually located in asia and europe although our point of sale is within the us our international sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
european sales were million in fiscal  down from sales of million in fiscal  reflecting a decrease in consumer electronics manufacturing in europe  especially of mobile telephones 
asia sales increased in fiscal to million  compared with million in fiscal gross margin 
the following table sets forth our gross margin and year to year change in gross margin by business segment for the fiscal years ended june   and fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenues gross margin gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin resulted principally from unabsorbed factory expenses attributed to a lower sales base and the write down of initial beta quattro robots consigned to customers of  as well as the write down of obsolete equipment in germany of  in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margin improvement resulted principally from a sales mix favoring higher margin products  notably the increased sales of our cobra products  second generation linear module controls  as well as increased sales of 
table of contents remanufactured robots 
other factors contributing to increased margins include increased volume throughput  improved robot component designs that achieve the same functionality at reduced cost  and increased outsourcing of robot subassemblies 
consumption of parts previously reserved as excess or obsolete totaled approximately  in fiscal  due to focus on service sales and the improved management of the fulfillment of those sales  offset by the reservation of approximately  for additional parts determined to be excess or obsolete over the year 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our gross margin percentage from period to period due to changes in volume  changes in availability of components  changes in product configuration  increased price based competition  and or changes in sales mix of products 
operating expenses research  development and engineering fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands expenses percentage of revenue research  development and engineering r d costs are expensed as incurred  with the exception of software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility and up to the general release of the software products which are capitalized 
technological feasibility is demonstrated by the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over either two or three years  whichever term is the estimated life of the software product 
research  development and engineering expenses increased in fiscal to million  or of revenues  compared with million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in r d in fiscal is primarily due to the increased materials purchased in developing our new quattro robot 
research  development and engineering expenses increased in to million  or of revenues  compared with million  or of revenues  in the growth in r d outlays was the result of recognition of stock based compensation expense totaling approximately  in fiscal that was not required in fiscal  as well as increased expenditures for software development activities  offset by  capitalization software development costs 
adept s capitalization of software costs  which commenced in the second quarter of fiscal  was  in fiscal and  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands expenses percentage of revenue selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  professional fees arising from legal  auditing and other consulting services  as well as tradeshow participation and other marketing costs 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or to million  or of revenues in fiscal  compared with million  or of revenues in fiscal the increase was in the area of general and administrative expenses and was primarily related to higher expense as a result of our settlement with crosslink and higher audit  legal and consulting related to the restatement of previous financial reports in early fiscal and an increase in fees payable to directors for attendance at board meetings due to increased number of meetings  offset by lower sales  marketing and customer services expenses 
we have not yet undertaken most of the effort related to sarbanes oxley section compliance regarding internal controls  and expect to incur substantial costs in connection with that project during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or in to million  or of revenues  compared with million  or of revenues  in the increase was primarily due to new product launches  increased marketing activities and expansion of our sales force  expenses related to our reincorporation in delaware  stock based employee compensation charges  and the re listing of adept s common stock on nasdaq 
also increased were expenditures audit and controls review activities as we began preparations to meet increased requirements in the future resulting from the sarbanes oxley act 
amortization 
amortization of intangible assets was  in fiscal  compared with  in and  in fiscal impairment of goodwill and intangibles as required under sfas no 
 adept evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet at least annually and we record a charge for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
in fiscal  we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill related to the acquisitions of hexavision and meta was not supportable because the estimate of future cash flows related to these intangible assets was not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such intangibles 
accordingly  we wrote down the entire value of goodwill related to the acquisitions and recorded a charge of million for asset impairment 
in fiscal and  no charge for impairment was recorded 
stock compensation expense 
adept adopted sfas r  share based payment  effective july   and was therefore not required to expense most stock compensation during fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our recognition of stock compensation expense 
under the provisions of sfas r we recorded million for stock based compensation expense for fiscal and million for fiscal for our stock option plans  espp and restricted stock grants 
we did not record an income tax benefit for the stock compensation expense in either year because of the extent of our net operating loss carry forwards 
crosslink settlement costs 
during fiscal  we recorded a million non cash expense paid in common shares associated with the settlement with crosslink 
this is a one time expense so will not impact future fiscal periods 
restructuring charges reversals 
we recorded million in restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily related to facility closure  lease termination and employee severance as part of our business restructuring at the end of june we reversed  in restructuring charges in fiscal and  in fiscal  which resulted primarily from the sublease of unused sales offices 
we expect to incur remaining restructuring charges of approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal related to our terminations of the quebec lease and the connecticut lease 
operating income loss 
operating loss was million for fiscal compared with operating income of  for fiscal and  for fiscal the operating loss in fiscal was the result of lower 
table of contents revenues and gross margin  combined with higher expenses for sales  general and administrative  and a one time settlement expense  restructuring charges related to the restructuring implemented at the end of fiscal and impairment of goodwill 
the decrease in operating income from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the impact of million of stock compensation expense in fiscal that had not been included in fiscal interest income expense  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  was  in fiscal  compared with interest expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in interest income in fiscal compared with the prior year was primarily due to a higher cash balance following the investment in adept by crosslink in june the decline in interest expense  net during fiscal compared with the prior year was primarily due to conversion of a million convertible note into adept common stock  which accrued interest at  in february other income 
we recorded other income of  in fiscal to reflect the disposal of equity positions in third parties  the substantial majority of which had been previously written off 
no such charges were incurred in fiscal and foreign currency translation gain loss 
foreign currency translation gain was  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for the foreign currency translation gains recorded resulted primarily from our sales and operating activities in europe and movements in the euro versus the us dollar 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes for fiscal was  as compared with a provision of  in the current year benefit arose primarily from the reversal of liabilities which adept believes are no longer probable  and as such have been adjusted 
the tax benefit of  is net of various state and foreign minimum tax expenses 
adept adjusts its tax liabilities and assets based on consideration a variety of factors  including interpretations of statutes and regulations as well as estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes 
the company has net operating losses which are sufficient to offset most of its domestic and foreign tax obligations
