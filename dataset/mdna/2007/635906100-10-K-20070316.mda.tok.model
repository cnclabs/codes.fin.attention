item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview national healthcare corporation anhc or the acompany is a leading provider of long term health care services 
we operate or manage long term health care centers with  beds in states and provide other services in two additional states 
these operations are provided by separately funded and maintained subsidiaries 
we provide long term health care services to patients in a variety of settings including long term nursing centers  managed care specialty units  sub acute care units  alzheimer s care units  homecare programs  assisted living centers and independent living centers 
in addition  we provide management and accounting services to owners of long term health care centers and advisory services to national health realty  inc  a nhr and prior to november  to national health investors  inc anhi 
executive summary earnings to monitor our earnings  we have developed budgets and management reports to monitor labor  census  and the composition of revenues 
inflationary increases in our costs may cause net earnings from patient services to decline 
development and growth the long term care industry has gone through a long period of financial distress caused by material reductions in government payments for services and dramatic increases in the cost of professional liability insurance 
as a result  we have limited our expansion efforts and used cash generated from operations to repay debt and build liquidity 
during  we completed a renovation cost of approximately  to a facility which we lease from nhi 
in addition  we completed a bed addition to an existing long term facility located in farragut  tennessee and a bed addition to an existing facility located in mauldin  south carolina 
the approximate cost of these additions was approximately  two bed additions to existing facilities costing approximately  located in garden city  south carolina and columbia  south carolina are scheduled to open during the first quarter of construction of a bed addition to an existing facility located in north augusta  south carolina expected to cost approximately  will begin in in march  we purchased for approximately  a bed long term health care center located in town and country  missouri 
we had managed the center since also during  we will apply for certificates of need for additional beds in our markets and will also evaluate the feasibility of expansion into new markets by building health care centers that provide services exclusively to private paying patients 
in we will continue to develop an active hospice program in selected areas through our partnership with the recently formed caris healthcare and are also exploring opportunities to expand our home health care services 
areas of focus proposed merger agreement between national healthcare corporation and national health realty  inc on december   national healthcare corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries  nhc op  lp and davis acquisition sub llc and national health realty  inc  entered into an agreement and plan of merger the amerger agreement 
pursuant to the merger agreement and subject to receipt of the required stockholder vote  national health realty  inc will consolidate with its wholly owned subsidiary new nhr  inc  as the result of which a new maryland corporation the aconsolidated company will be formed 
subject to the receipt of the required stockholder vote  regulatory approval  and consummation of certain other transactions specified in the merger agreement  the consolidate d company will be merged with and into davis acquisition sub llc the amerger which will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of nhc op  lp and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of the consolidated company 
pursuant to the merger agreement  each outstanding common share of nhr not owned by davis acquisition sub llc  nhc op  lp  or nhc  will be converted into the right to receive one share of nhc series a convertible preferred stock  plus in cash 
each share of the preferred stock will be entitled to cumulative annual preferred dividends of per share and will have a liquidation preference of per share 
the preferred stock will be listed on the american stock exchange and will be convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of national healthcare corporation common stock  subject to adjustment 
the transaction will require cash of approximately  in addition to nhc s operating cash  we may borrow from our captive insurance company subject to regulatory requirements or sell marketable securities 
it is expected that both national healthcare corporation and national health realty  inc will hold special meetings of each company s shareholders at a future date to consider matters related to the merger agreement and that a joint proxy statement prospectus will be issued by the companies 
the board of directors of national healthcare corporation has approved the merger agreement and the merger and has determined that the merger is in the best interest of national healthcare corporation shareholders 
the board believes that the combined company will provide the present shareholders of nhc with a more focused and efficient corporation whose interests are more closely aligned with those of its shareholders 
furthermore  we believe that the merger will i provide nhc with a larger asset and equity base that is anticipated to enhance nhc s future growth and prospects for long term increased in stockholder value  ii provide nhc with greater operating flexibility to renovate and expand its facilities  iii free nhc management from the burden of having to manage two publicly traded companies  and allow nhc management to devote more time to the management of nhc s core business operations  iv negate the possibility that nhr could be acquired by a competitor of nhc  and v broaden nhc s access to debt financing sources 
following the merger  nhc will no longer be required to make lease payments to nhr 
assuming the continuation of current operating trends  the elimination of such required lease payments will result in a substantial increase in the annual recurring free cash flow of nhc  even after providing for the preferred dividends which nhc will be required to pay on the preferred stock 
in addition  the merger will eliminate the financial uncertainty that resulted from the periodic negotiation and renegotiation of the leasing terms of the properties that nhr leased to nhc 
due to recent changes with respect to the taxation of corporate dividends  the merger is now feasible from a us federal tax perspective 
because of a change in the us federal tax law w hich reduced the tax rate applicable to dividends paid to stockholders of c corporations such as nhc  the relative tax advantages of operating nhr s business under the reit structure have been greatly reduced 
completion of the merger is subject to hart scott rodino anti trust review and approval by shareholders of national healthcare corporation of the nhc proposal and shareholders of national health realty  inc of the nhr proposal 
there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted 
nhi lease renewal on december   we reached an agreement with national health investors  inc to extend our lease of properties through december   with three additional five year renewal options  each at fair market value 
this lease extension assures our long term use of these properties 
nhr lease renewal effective august   we reached an agreement with national health realty  inc nhr to extend our lease of properties through december   with an additional renewal option for years at fair market value 
this lease extension assures our long term use of these properties 
accrued risk reserves our accrued professional liability reserves  workers compensation reserves and health insurance reserves totaled  at the end of and are a primary area of management focus 
we have set aside restricted cash to fully fund our professional liability and workers compensation reserves 
as to the tragic fire on september  at the nashville skilled nursing subsidiary  we have settled all of lawsuits filed against the company  the last two cases being settled in november  as to the risks of fire  we have installed fire sprinklers in all of our owned and leased long term care centers that were not already so equipped 
in addition  we have implemented a comprehensive fire safety training program at all of our centers and reviewed and modified  if necessary  our priority safety procedures 
as to exposure for professional liability claims  we have developed for our centers performance certification criteria to measure and bring focus to the patient care issues most likely to produce professional liability exposure  including in house acquired pressure ulcers  significant weight loss and numbers of falls 
these programs for certification  which we regularly modify and improve  have produced measurable improvements in reducing these incidents 
our experience is that achieving goals in these patient care areas improves both patient and employee satisfaction 
furthermore  we are continuing efforts to identify and restructure the ownership or management of our higher risk operations and locations to eliminate nhc liability exposure 
as to workers compensation claims  we have implemented programs such as safety boards  safety awards  and tracking systems for adays without a lost time accident to bring focus to these risks at all of our locations 
as to health insurance claims  we changed our health plan network provider to obtain better discounts in and we continue to evaluate our health plan design to identify opportunities for improvements and cost savings 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
our critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are as follows revenue recognition third party payors approximately   and of our net revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews 
any differences between our estimates of settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized 
for the cost report years and  we have submitted various requests for exceptions to medicare routine cost limitations for reimbursement 
we received preliminary intermediary approval on  of these requests in after settlement of outstanding litigation styled braeuning  et al vs 
national healthcare lp  et al 
we have  in addition  made provisions of approximately  for othe r various medicare and medicaid issues for current and prior year cost reports 
consistent with our revenue recognition policies  we will record revenues associated with the approved requests and the other various issues when the approvals  including the final cost report audits  are assured 
the three year review period expired in for approximately  of the routine cost limit exceptions and this amount was recorded as revenue in even though we received no cash payments for this revenue in adjustments of a similar nature were not significant in or revenue recognition private pay for private pay patients in skilled nursing or assisted living facilities  we bill room and board in advance for the current month with payment being due upon receipt of the statement in the month the services are performed 
charges for ancillary  pharmacy  therapy and other services to private patients are billed in the month following the performance of services  however  all billings are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
accrued risk reserves we are principally self insured for risks related to employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
our accrued risk reserves primarily represent the accrual for self insured risks associated with employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
the accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims 
our policy with respect to a significant portion of our workers compensation and professional and general liability claims is to use an actuary to support the estimates recorded for incurred but unreported claims 
our health insurance reserve is based on our known claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined b y our analysis of historical claims paid 
we reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis 
professional liability remains an area of particular concern to us 
the entire long term care industry has seen a dramatic increase in personal injury wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by nursing homes and their employees in providing care to residents 
as of december   we and or our managed centers are defendants in such claims inclusive of years through it is also possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these reserve estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
we maintain insurance coverage for incidents occurring in all provider locations owned  leased or managed by us 
the coverages include both primary policies and umbrella policies 
for  we maintain primary coverage through our own insurance company with excess coverage provided by a third party insurance company 
for  we maintain both primary and excess coverage through our own insurance subsidiary 
in all years  settlements  if any  in excess of available insurance policy limits and our own reserves would be expensed by us 
revenue recognition subordination of fees and uncertain collections we provide management services to certain long term care facilities and to others we provide accounting and financial services 
we generally charge of net revenues for our management services and a predetermined fixed rate per bed for the accounting and financial services 
our policy is to recognize revenues associated with both management services and accounting and financial services on an accrual basis as the services are provided 
however  under the terms of our management contracts  payments for our management services are subject to subordination to other expenditures of the long term care center being managed 
furthermore  there are certain of the third parties with which we have contracted to provide services and which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that collection is not reasona bly assured and our policy is to recognize income only in the period in which the amounts are realized 
we may receive payment for the unpaid and unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from the operating and investing activities of the centers are sufficient to pay the fees 
there can be no assurance that such future cash flows will occur 
the realization of such previously unrecognized revenue could cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
certain of our accounts receivable from private paying patients and certain of our notes receivable are subject to credit losses 
we have attempted to reserve for expected accounts receivable credit losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate 
we continually monitor and evaluate the carrying amount of our notes receivable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 aaccounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and it is possible  however  that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of the receivables changes over time 
we continually review and refine our estimation process to make it as reactive to these changes as possible 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate credit losses on these balances 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
potential recognition of deferred income during  we sold the assets of eight long term health care centers to national health corporation anational  our administrative general partner at the time of the sale 
the resulting profit of  was deferred and will be amortized into income beginning with the collection of the note receivable up to  with the balance  of the profit being amortized into income on a straight line basis over the management contract period 
 of the previously deferred income will be recognized as income at the time of and in proportion to the collection of the associated  note 
additional deferred income of  will be reported when the company no longer has an obligation to advance the  working capital loan 
the collection of up to  of notes receiva ble would result in the immediate recognition of up to  of pretax net income 
currently  the notes are due december  guarantees we guarantee the debt of managed and other long term health care centers  and the debt of national and the esop 
we recorded a liability in the amount of  related to our guarantee of  of debt of six long term health care centers in florida 
we recorded this liability based upon our estimate of the value of the underlying collateral of the loans 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments to our estimates and liability under these guarantees and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
tax contingencies nhc continually evaluates for tax related contingencies 
contingencies may arise where tax laws may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment 
we believe we have adequate provisions for tax contingencies and related penalties and interest 
however  because of uncertainty of interpretation by various tax authorities and the possibility that there are issues that have not been recognized by management  we cannot guarantee we have accurately estimated our tax liabilities 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with limited need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
management services and our subordinated fee structure we provide management services to long term care centers under terms whereby the payments for our services are subject to subordination to other expenditures of the long term care provider 
furthermore  there are certain third parties with whom we have contracted to provide management services and which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that the service revenue realization is uncertain 
we recognize the expenses related to the provision of these services in the period in which they are incurred 
we agree to subordinate our fees to the other expenses of a managed center because we believe we know how to improve the quality of patient services and finances of a long term care center and because subordinating our fees demonstrates to the owner and employees of the managed center how confident we are of the impact we can have in making the center operations successful 
we may continue to provide services to certain managed centers despite not being fully paid currently so that we may be able to collect unpaid fees in the future from improved operating results and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services to a center may be small compared to the potential benefit 
also  we may benefit from providing other ancillary services to the managed center 
we may receive payment for the unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from the operating and investment activities of the centers are sufficien t to pay the fees 
there can be no assurance that such future cash flows will occur 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements regarding our relationships with national  nhi and centers previously owned by nhi and the recognition of management fees from long term care centers owned by these parties

the overall average census in owned  leased and managed health care centers for which we guarantee the debt for was compared to in and in approximately and  and of our net revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
as discussed above in the application of critical accounting policies section  amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
see application of critical accounting policies for discussion of the effects that this revenue concentration and the uncertainties related to such revenues have on our revenue recognition policies 
government program financial changes cost containment will continue to be a priority for federal and state governments for health care services  including the types of services we provide 
medicare effective october   our pps rates were increased by due to inflation update and care based statistical area cbsa designations 
we estimate that the positive revenue effect of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms final rule was  for the fourth quarter of the implementation of the cms final rule caused a redistribution of payments among providers 
this is accomplished by refinements expanding the resource utilization groups rugs from rug groups to rug groups and by eliminating temporary rate add ons 
the elimination of temporary add ons has always been tied to the long awaited rug refinement 
rug refinement increases the case mix weight that applies to both nursing and non ancillary therapy ancillary costs 
this is a permanent change in the pps methodology 
the deficit reduction act of dra mandates the reduction of private pay only bad debt payments  which payments are included in patient revenues  to skilled nursing facilities 
the first year  fy  reduction was  the dra furthermore mandates the home health payment rate for be frozen 
hhas serving rural beneficiaries saw a one year five percent add on payment under the legislation 
the rural add on payment totaled approximately million for our home care operations in fy due to a significant number our homecares serving rural counties 
for  a market basket update of is expected along with the elimination of the one year five percent add on that was implemented in medicaid tennessee annual medicaid rate increases were implemented effective july  the increase in revenue was  per quarter 
tennessee medicaid is implementing an indirect allocation for certain significant ancillary categories eg physical  occupational  and speech therapy for the level intermediate medicaid plan which will prove detrimental 
the allocation will negatively impact the state wide ceiling used to set per diem rates in addition to reducing allowable cost at our owned and managed tennessee nursing centers participating in medicaid 
the indirect allocation will be partially implemented on cost reports and will affect medicaid per diem rates beginning july  the full allocation will be applied to the cost reports and negatively affect the three year average inflation methodology in july the reimbursement effect of the implementation  while negative  is not determinable until medicaid rates are computed by the tennessee state comptroller s office 
south carolina medicaid annual per diem rate increases are expected to result in additional revenues of approximately  per quarter 
compared to results for compared to include a increase in net revenues and a increase in net income before income taxes after excluding the consideration of the effect of the recovery of a note receivable previously written off 
net patient revenues increased  or compared to the same period last year due to government and program and private pay rate increases and bed additions 
medicaid rate changes that became effective july  increased our revenues by approximately  the acquisition of our bed long term care facility located in town and country  missouri added approximately  to net patient revenue 
other revenues this year decreased  or to  other revenues in include management and accounting service fees of   in and insurance services revenue of   in 
the decrease in management and accounting service fees is due in part to the recognition in of  of fees received in but which had been doubtful of collection in prior years 
during  nhc provided management  accounting and financial services for facilities as compared to facilities during see application of critical accounting policies  revenue recognition subordination of fees and uncertain collections above 
the decrease in insurance service revenues is due to decreased premiums for professional liability insurance and decreased premiums for workers compensation insurance from our wholly owned insurance subsidiaries 
the premiums charged are based on factors considering actuarially determined estimates of potential liability 
total costs and expenses for increased  or to  from  in salaries  wages and benefits  the largest operating costs of this service company  increased  or to  from  other operating expenses increased  or to  for compared to  in rent expense decreased  or to  due to decreased rates

recently passed minimum wage increases will not have a material impact on salaries and wages 
increases in other operating costs and expenses are due in part to the acquisition of a bed long term care center  newly opened additions and from inflationary increases 
other operating costs and expenses include professional liability insurance and workers compensation insurance expense 
costs and expenses for include a  recovery of a note receivable from a health care center we manage in nashville  tennessee which had been previously written off 
the center was able to refinance its debt 
expenses in include a loss of  for the write off of a receivable 
this note receivable is due from a bed long term health care center in missouri that we manage 
we continue to monitor closely our other notes receivable from centers to which we provide management or accounting services 
the increase in other operating expenses related to town and country amount to approximately  the decrease in interest costs is partially due to recording capitalized interest of approximately  for construction projects financed internally in the period ended december  the weighted average interest rate for our debt increased to in from in compared to results for compared to include a increase in net revenues and a increase in net income before income taxes 
as indicated in the tables shown above  our patient revenues for increased  or compared to however  if you exclude the  of prior year medicare and medicaid adjustments  our patient revenues increased approximately  we estimate that the october medicare rate increases for skilled nursing centers and homecare programs increased our revenues by approximately  for the twelve months ended december  our cool springs health care and assisted living center in franklin  tennessee opened in may and a long term bed addition located in murfreesboro  tennessee opened in august these additions  net of a decrease in revenues from beds closed elsewhere  added approximately  to net patient revenues 
finally  improved census mix and therapy and pharmacy billings to managed centers increased our twelve months revenues approximately  compared to the period last year 
patient revenue increases in included the recognition of approximately  of prior period medicare and medicaid adjustments 
prior year adjustments in were not significant 
other revenues this year increased  or to  other revenues in include management and accounting service fees of   in and insurance services revenue of   in 
the increase in management and accounting service fees is due in part to the recognition in of  of fees received in but which had been doubtful of collection in prior years 
during  nhc provided management  accounting and financial services for facilities as compared to facilities during the increase in insurance service revenues is due to increased premiums for professional liability insurance from our wholly owned insurance subsidiary

increases in other operating costs and expenses are due in part to increases in the costs of health insurance and to increased census at our long term care beds and assisted living units which opened in may and long term care beds which opened in august increases were offset in part due to decreases in professional liability insurance and workers compensation insurance 
expenses also included a loss of  for the write down of a note receivable in march  this note receivable is due from a bed long term health care center in missouri that we manage 
as a result of increased operating costs and the lack of increase in reimbursement rates  the cash flows of this center declined and the center has not made a principal payment on this note since december  based on an analysis consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 aaccounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  we concluded that a write down of  was required 
we continue to monitor closely our other notes receivable from centers to which we provide management or accounting services 
rent expense increased primarily due to increases in percentage rent to nhr and nhi 
the increase was offset in part due to terminated leases for an bed long term health care center and a bed long term health care center in the increase in interest costs is primarily due to recording capitalized interest of approximately  for construction projects financed internally in the nine month period ended december  the weighted average interest rate for our debt increased to in from in liquidity  capital resources and financial condition sources and uses of funds our primary sources of cash include revenues from the healthcare and senior living facilities we operate  insurance services  management services and accounting services

increases in restricted cash totaled  compared to  in the prior year 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to increases in revenues and timing differences 
the increase in restricted cash is due primarily to the cash reserved for our accrued risk reserves  including professional liability claims  workers compensation claims and health insurance claims  net of cash paid out for those claims 
amounts due to third party payors  which are payable to medicare and medicaid intermediaries decreased  in due to the recognition of revenue related to the expiration of the review period for routine limit cost exception requests which were originally approved in the increase in other current liabilities and accrued risks reserves accounted for  in and  in of the cash provided by operating activities

we have guaranteed debt obligations of certain other entities totaling approximately  these guarantees are not included in the table above because we do not anticipate material obligations under these commitments 
nhc has entered into agreements to complete construction of leasehold improvements at three long term health care facilities 
at december   we are obligated on construction contracts in the amount of approximately  our current cash on hand  marketable securities  short term notes receivable  operating cash flows  and as needed  our borrowing capacity are expected to be adequate to meet these contractual obligations and to finance our operating requirements  growth and development plans 
in order to fund the proposed merger of nhr  nhc may borrow from its captive insurance company subject to regulatory requirements or sell marketable securities as needed 
we started paying quarterly dividends in the second quarter of and anticipate the continuation of dividend payments as approved quarterly by the board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements and debt guarantees in addition to our primary debt obligations  which are included in our consolidated financial statements  we have guaranteed the debt obligations of certain other entities 
those guarantees  which are not included as debt obligations in our consolidated financial statements  total  at december  and include  of debt of managed and other long term health care centers and  of debt of national and the esop 
the  of guarantees of debt of managed and other long term health care centers relates to debt obligations of seven long term health care centers to which we provide management or accounting services 
we have agreed to guarantee these obligations in order to obtain management or accounting services agreements 
for this service  we charge an annual guarantee fee of to of the outstanding principal balance guaranteed  which fee is in addition to our management or accounting services fee 
all of this guaranteed indebtedness is secured by first mortgages  pledges of personal property  accounts receivable  marketable securities and  in certain instances  the personal guarantees of the owners of the facilities 
the  of guarantees of debt of national and the esop relates to senior secured notes held by financial institutions 
the total outstanding balance of national and the esop s obligations under these senior secured notes is  of this obligation   has been included in our debt obligations because we are a direct obligor on this indebtedness 
the remaining  which is not included in our debt obligations because we are not a direct obligor  is due from nhi to national and the esop 
additionally  under the amended terms dated march  of these note agreements  the right of the lending institutions to require nhc to purchase the notes at par value under a guaranty and contingency purchase agreement has been removed 
the  of senior secured notes payable and the  guarantee described above have cross default provisions with other debt of national and the esop 
we currently believe that national and the esop are in compliance with the terms of their debt agreements 
as of december   our maximum potential loss related to the aforementioned debt guarantees and financial guarantees is  which is the outstanding balance of our guarantees 
we have accrued approximately  for potential losses as a result of our guarantees 
we have no outstanding letters of credit 
we may or may not in the future elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure in the future 
at december   we did not participate in any such financial investments 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards 
impact of inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years 
however  rates paid under the medicare and medicaid programs do not necessarily reflect all inflationary changes and are subject to cuts unrelated to inflationary costs 
therefore  there can be no assurance that future rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases in our labor and other health care service costs 
recently passed minimum wage increases are not expected to have a material impact on salaries and wages 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have minimal impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
approximately million of our notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
as the interest rates on these notes receivable are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
approximately million of our notes receivable bear interest at variable rates generally at the prime rate plus
