item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risks related to our business included in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leader in the distribution of avocados  processed avocado products  and other perishable food products throughout the united states and elsewhere in the world 
our history and expertise in handling california grown avocados has allowed us to develop a reputation of delivering quality products  at competitive prices  while providing a competitive return to our growers 
this reputation has enabled us to expand our product offering to include avocados sourced on an international basis  processed avocado products  and other perishable foods 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we examined our california avocados and international avocados and perishable food products reporting segments 
we concluded that these two reporting segments have similar economic characteristics  production processes  customers and distribution methods 
therefore  in accordance with the aggregation criteria of fasb statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we combined these two operating segments into one reportable segment  fresh products 
as a result  we now report our operations in two different business segments fresh products and processed products 
see footnote in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we report our financial results on a november to october fiscal year basis to coincide with the california avocado harvest season 
on october   we completed a series of transactions whereby common and preferred shareholders of calavo growers of california  an agricultural marketing cooperative association  exchanged all of their outstanding shares for shares of our common stock 
concurrently with this transaction  the cooperative was merged into us with calavo emerging as the surviving entity 
these transactions had the effect of converting the legal structure of the business from a non profit cooperative to a for profit corporation 
the merger and the conversion were approved on an overwhelming basis by both the cooperative s shareholders and our board of directors 
prior to the merger  the cooperative reported results of operations as constituting either member the packing and distribution of avocados procured from either members or associate members or non member business non member business included both the processed product business and the sourcing and distribution of all crops that were not procured from the cooperative s members 
in august  we entered into a joint venture agreement with san rafael distributing srd for the purpose of marketing  sale and distribution of fresh produce from the existing location of srd at the los angeles wholesale produce market terminal market  located in los angeles  california 
such joint venture operates under the name of maui fresh international  llc maui fresh and commenced operations in august srd and calavo each have an equal one half ownership interest in maui fresh  but srd shall have overall management responsibility for the operations of maui fresh at the terminal market 
therefore  pursuant to accounting principle board apb and emerging issues task force eitf  we believe that our level of economic influence is that of significant 
as such  we will use the equity method to account for our investment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our fresh products business grades  sizes  packs  cools  and ripens if desired avocados grown in california for delivery to our customers 
we presently operate three packinghouses in southern california 
these packinghouses handled approximately of the california avocado crop during the fiscal year  based on data obtained from the california avocado commission 
our operating results and the returns we pay our growers are highly dependent on the volume of avocados delivered to our packinghouses  as a significant portion of our costs are fixed 
our strategy calls for continued efforts in retaining existing growers  aggressively recruiting new growers  and procuring a larger percentage of the california avocado crop to improve our results from operations 
additionally  our fresh products business also procures avocados grown in mexico and chile  as well as other various commodities  including papayas  tomatoes  chili peppers  pineapples  and ginger 
we operate a packinghouse in mexico that  together with certain co packers that we frequently purchase fruit from  handled approximately of the mexican avocado crop bound for the united states market and approximately of the avocados exported from mexico to countries other than the united states  during the mexican season  based on our estimates 
additionally  during the chilean avocado season  we handled approximately of the chilean avocado crop  based on our estimates 
our strategy is to procure and sell non californian grown avocados to complement our distribution efforts of california grown avocados 
we believe that the introduction of these avocados  although competitive at times with california grown avocados  provides a level of supply stability that may  over time  help solidify the demand for avocados among consumers in the united states and elsewhere in the world 
we believe our efforts in distributing our other various commodities  such as those shown above  complement our offerings of avocados 
from time to time  we continue to explore distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to the business 

table of contents our processed products business procures avocados  processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products  and distributes the processed product to our customers 
in february  our board of directors approved a plan whereby the operations of our processed products business would be relocated 
the plan called for the closing of our santa paula  california and mexicali  baja california norte processing facilities and the relocation of these operations to a new facility in uruapan  michoacan  mexico 
this restructuring has provided for cost savings in the elimination of certain transportation costs  duplicative overhead structures  and savings in the overall cost of labor and services 
the uruapan facility commenced operations in february and the santa paula and mexicali facilities were closed in february and august during fiscal  we incurred costs related to this restructuring approximating million  which are recorded in our income statement as both cost of sales million and selling  general and administrative expenses million 
all the above amounts have been paid and we do not expect any additional operating costs related to this restructuring 
processed products customers include both food service industry and retail businesses 
our strategy calls for the development of new guacamole recipes and other processed avocado products that address the diverse taste of today s consumers 
we also seek to expand our relationships with major food service companies and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace 
our fresh products business is highly seasonal and is characterized by crop volume and price changes 
furthermore  the operating results of all of our businesses  including our processed products business  have been  and will continue to be  affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as pests and disease  weather patterns  changes in demand by consumers  the timing of the receipt  reduction  or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products on a timely basis  availability and cost of avocados and supplies from growers and vendors  new product introductions by our competitors  change in the mix of avocados and processed products we sell  and general economic conditions 
we believe  however  that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future 
recent developments dividend payment in january  we paid a per share dividend in the aggregate amount of million to shareholders of record on december  short term borrowings in october  we renewed and extended one of our short term  non collateralized  revolving credit facilities 
this credit facility now expires in february under the terms of this agreement  we are advanced funds for working capital purposes 
total credit available under this short term borrowing agreement was million  with an average interest rate of at october  under this credit facility  we had no amounts outstanding as of october  the credit facility contains various financial covenants  the most significant relating to working capital  tangible net worth as defined  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at october   except for the working capital covenants with which we obtained appropriate waivers 
retirement of common stock in december  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price per share of from the estate of a deceased former member of our board of directors 
operating lease in august  we entered into an operating lease agreement with columbia new jersey commodore industrial  llc to rent approximately  square feet of building space in swedesboro  new jersey 
this lease enables us to not only invest in our proripevip tm avocado ripening program  but also expand our refrigeration and storage capabilities 
the lease has a term of approximately years and includes scheduled rent increases 
pursuant to fasb technical bulletin  our straight line rent expense for such lease will approximate  per month for the duration of such lease 
this facility commenced operations during the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables  inventories  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  promotional allowances  income taxes  retirement benefits  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this annual report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
promotional allowances 
we provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale  based on our historical experience 
our estimates are generally based on evaluating the average length of time between the product shipment date and the date on which we pay the customer the promotional allowance 
the product of this lag factor and our historical promotional allowance payment rate is the basis for the promotional allowance included in accrued expenses on our balance sheet 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate and the tax bases of assets and liabilities are based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable 
deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
valuation allowances are established when it is deemed  more likely than not  that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or when a possible impairment is indicated  using the fair value based test prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value  including goodwill 
we primarily use an income approach which considers the present value of future cash flows in combination with a market approach which considers what other purchasers in the marketplace have paid for similar businesses to determine fair value 
future cash flows typically include operating cash flows for the business for five years and an estimated terminal value 
management judgment is required in the estimation of future operating results and to determine the appropriate terminal values 
future operating results and terminal values could differ from the estimates and could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
allowance for accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable balances based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition 
sales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has been made  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  storage  bagging and palletization charges  is recorded when services are performed and sales of the related products are delivered 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income  expressed as percentages of our total net sales  for the periods indicated year ended october  net sales gross margins selling  general and administrative operating income interest income interest expense other income  net net income net sales we believe that the fundamentals for our products continue to be favorable 
government census studies continue to indicate a shift in the demographics of the us population in which larger portions of the population descend from a hispanic origin 
avocados are considered a staple item purchased by hispanic consumers and their acceptance as part of american cuisine continues to spur demand for our products 
we anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the united states marketplace driven by growth in the hispanic community and general acceptance in american cuisine 
as the largest marketer of avocado products in the united states  we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow all segments of our business 
additionally  we also believe that avocados and avocado based products will further penetrate other marketplaces that we currently operate in  as interest in avocados continues to expand 
sales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has been made  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  storage  bagging and palletization charges  is recorded when services are performed and sales of the related products are delivered 
we provide for sales returns and promotional allowances at the time of shipment  based on our experience 
the following table summarizes our net sales by business segment change change dollars in thousands net sales fresh products processed products total net sales as a percentage of net sales fresh products processed products net sales for the year ended october   when compared to  increased by approximately million  or  principally as a result of an increase in both our fresh products and processed products segments 
the increase in sales for both segments was primarily driven by a significant increase in total pounds sold 
net sales generated by fresh products segment are significantly impacted by the availability of chilean and mexican grown avocados in the us markets 
in november  the usda published a rule allowing hass avocado imports from mexico into all states year round up from states for only a six month period  except for california  florida  and hawaii 
we expect the restriction on such states to be lifted in february for the remaining states  however  mexico was able to deliver its fruit for all of fiscal the implementation of this rule resulted in a significant increase in the sale of mexican sourced fruit during fiscal the following tables set forth sales by product category  freight and other charges and sales incentives  by segment dollars in thousands

all intercompany sales are eliminated in our consolidated results of operations 
fresh products net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this increase is primarily related to an increase in california avocados sales  partially offset by a decrease in mexican and chilean avocado sales 
sales of california sourced avocados increased million for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
this increase was primarily related a increase in pounds of avocados sold  partially offset by a decrease in our average selling prices 
this increase in pounds sold was consistent with the expected increase in the overall harvest of the california avocado crop for the season 
our market share of california avocados remained consistent at for the year ended october   compared to for the same period in the prior year 
based on estimates generated from the california avocado commission  we expect the california avocado crop for the season to be substantially smaller than the crop 
for fiscal year  average selling prices  on a per carton basis  for california avocados were lower when compared to the same prior year period 
this pricing structure primarily reflects the impact of a larger california avocado harvest  as well as a increase in the sale of grade two hass avocados in proportion to grade one hass avocados sales 
grade two hass avocados generally sell for significantly less than grade one hass avocados 
for fiscal year  we believe that the demand for california avocados will remain strong in the us marketplace  and  as a result  such is expected to have a positive impact on sales prices 
california avocados are primarily sold in the us marketplace 
sales of mexican sourced avocados decreased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in pounds of mexican avocados sold  due primarily to the large california crop discussed above 
our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  of mexican avocados experienced a marginal decrease of for fiscal when compared to the same prior period 
sales of chilean sourced avocados decreased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in pounds of chilean avocados sold 
this decrease was primarily related to 
table of contents the size of the chilean avocado crop  as well as the timing of the delivery to the united states 
our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  of chilean avocados experienced a marginal increase of for fiscal when compared to the same prior period 
mexican and chilean grown avocados are primarily sold in the us  japanese  and or european marketplace 
we anticipate that sales of mexican grown avocados will increase in fiscal primarily as a result of the smaller california avocado crop discussed above 
we are unable to predict  however  the impact related to the usda published rule that will allow hass avocado imports from mexico into all states up from states effective february in any case  we intend to leverage our position as the largest packer of mexican grown avocados for export markets to improve the overall performance of these sales 
sales of papayas decreased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the volume of papaya fruit sold 
this decrease was primarily related to adverse weather conditions negatively affecting the current year papaya crop 
such decrease  however  was partially offset by an increase in average selling prices of papayas  on a per carton basis  which increased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase in average selling prices to significantly fewer pounds sold in the us marketplace 
we anticipate our papaya results to increase in fiscal  as we expect an increase in the related papaya crop 
net sales delivered by the business decreased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in california avocados sales  partially offset by an increase in mexican and chilean avocado sales 
sales of california sourced avocados decreased million for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
this decrease was primarily related a decrease in pounds of avocados sold  partially offset by an increase in our average selling prices 
this decrease in pounds sold was consistent with the expected decrease in the overall harvest of the california avocado crop for the season 
our market share of california avocados remained consistent at for the year ended october   compared to for the same period in the prior year 
for fiscal year  average selling prices  on a per carton basis  for california avocados were higher when compared to the same prior year period 
this pricing structure primarily reflected the impact of a smaller california avocado harvest  partially offset by an increase in foreign sourced fruit in the us marketplace 
sales of mexican sourced avocados increased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was primarily related to a increase in pounds of mexican avocados sold 
this increase was primarily related to the smaller california crop discussed above  as well as the usda published rule that allowed hass avocado imports from mexico into us states  up from us states  effective february pricing during fiscal was stable when compared to fiscal sales of chilean sourced avocados increased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was primarily related to a increase in pounds of chilean avocados sold 
this increase was primarily related to the size of the chilean avocado crop 
pricing during fiscal was stable when compared to fiscal in october  the usda announced the creation of a hass avocado board to promote the sale of hass variety avocados in the us marketplace 
this board provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the us marketplace  including imported and california grown fruit 
the california avocado commission  which receives its funding from california avocado growers  has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales 
we believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the us will  in the long term  positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our california avocado and international avocado businesses 
during fiscal  and  on behalf of avocado growers  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the california avocado commission 
during fiscal  and  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the hass avocado board 
processed products net sales increased by approximately million  or for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
the increase in net sales is primarily attributable to an increase of million pounds of product sold  or 
such increase was partially offset  however  by a decrease in the net selling price totaling per product pound sold  or 
during fiscal year  the increase in pounds sold primarily relates to an increase in the sale of our high pressure guacamole product  which increased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in our net average selling price primarily relates to a change in our product mix 
net sales increased by approximately million  or for fiscal  when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 
table of contents million pounds of product sold  or  net of a decrease in sales incentives and promotions paid  totaling per pound of product sold  or 
such increase  however  was partially offset by a decrease in the sales price per product pound sold of  or 
during fiscal year  the increase in pounds sold primarily related to an increase in the sale of our high pressure guacamole product  which increased when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in our average selling price and sales incentives and promotional activities paid primarily related to a change in our product mix 
during fiscal year  we primarily operated one high pressure line designed to manufacture processed avocado products that are not frozen guacamole in uruapan 
this machine ran at about capacity during fiscal we anticipate that we will operate such high pressure machine at a similar capacity during fiscal year we presently own another  much smaller  high pressure machine  also located in uruapan  that was used occasionally during fiscal we anticipate trading such smaller machine in for credit towards another large high pressure machine similar to the large machine that is currently in use in uruapan  once we receive the second high pressure machine 
this second large high pressure machine was ordered in july and is expected to be received during our second fiscal quarter of utilizing avocado pulp and chunks  these high pressure machines allow us to deliver fresh guacamole to retail and food service customers 
sales of our high pressure product totaled approximately million and million for fiscal years and gross margins the following table summarizes our gross margins and gross profit percentages by business segment change change dollars in thousands gross margins fresh products processed products total gross margins gross profit percentages fresh products processed products consolidated our cost of goods sold consists predominantly of fruit costs  packing materials  freight and handling  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with preparing food products  and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold 
consolidated gross margin  as a percent of sales  increased for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year this increase was principally attributable to increased profitability in fresh products segment  as well as our processed product segment 
consolidated gross margin  as a percent of sales  decreased for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year this decrease was principally attributable to decreased profitability in our fresh products segment  partially offset by increased profitability in our processed product segment 
gross margins and gross profit percentages related to california avocados are largely dependent on production yields achieved at our packinghouses  current market prices of avocados  and the volume of avocados packed 
the increase in our gross margin percentage during fiscal year was primarily related to a significant increase in pounds of fruit sold  partially offset by an increase in the cost of fruit 
during fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  we experienced a increase in pounds of avocados sold 
this had the effect of decreasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
the decrease in our gross margin percentage during fiscal year was primarily related to a significant decrease in pounds of fruit sold 
during fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  we experienced a decrease in pounds of avocados sold 
this had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
such higher per pound cost was partially offset  however  by an increase in our packing and marketing fee which is charged to cover our costs and a profit 
the gross margin and gross profit percentage for consignment sales  including primarily chilean avocados  as well as hawaiian grown papayas  is dependent on the volume of fruit we handle and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party packers 
the gross margin we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each packer 
accordingly  the gross margin results for these products are a function of the volume handled and the competitiveness of the sales prices that we realize 
although we generally do not take legal title to such avocados and perishable products  we do assume responsibilities principally assuming credit risk  inventory loss and delivery risk  and limited pricing risk that are consistent with acting as a principal in the transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations include sales and cost of sales from the sale of avocados and perishable products procured under consignment arrangements 
for fiscal year   and  we generated gross margins of million  million  and million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties 

table of contents our business with mexican growers differs in that we operate a packinghouse in mexico and purchase avocados directly from the field 
alternatively  we may also purchase mexican avocados directly from co packers located in mexico as well 
in either case  the gross margin and gross profit percentages generated by our mexican operations are significantly impacted by the volume of avocados handled by our packinghouse and the cost of the fruit 
during fiscal year  our gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year such decrease is primarily related to both the significant decrease in the volume of mexican avocados sold  totaling primarily related to the large california crop discussed above  as well as an increase in mexican fruit costs 
collectively  these items contributed to a higher per pound cost  which negatively affected gross margins 
during fiscal year  our gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados increased from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year we did not experience a significant fluctuation in our gross margin percentage for fiscal as compared to fiscal related to our mexican operations 
gross margins and gross profit percentages for our processed products business are largely dependent on the pricing of our final product and the cost of avocados used in preparing guacamole 
during fiscal year  the processed products gross profit percentages increased primarily as a result of lower fruit costs and increases in total pounds produced  both of which had the effect of reducing our per pound costs 
during fiscal year  the processed products gross profit percentages increased primarily as a result of efficiencies related to the relocation of production from santa paula  california and mexicali  mexico to our newly acquired facility in uruapan  mexico 
such efficiencies include the elimination of duplicative overhead  as well as lower production costs 
additionally  our processed product segment experienced lower fruit costs 
such improvements  however  were partially offset by an increase in the sale of products that generate a lower gross margin then those sold in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses include costs of marketing and advertising  sales expenses  and other general and administrative costs 
for fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  compared to the same period for fiscal this increase was primarily related to higher corporate costs  including  but not limited to  costs related to an increase in stock based compensation totaling approximately million  an increase in management bonuses totaling approximately million  and an increase in employee compensation costs totaling approximately million 
such higher corporate costs were partially offset by a decrease in auditing sarbanes oxley costs totaling approximately million  a decrease in bad debt expense totaling approximately million  and a decrease in corporate moving expenses totaling approximately million
