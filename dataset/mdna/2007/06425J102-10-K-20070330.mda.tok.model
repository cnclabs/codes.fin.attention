item a 
risk factors 
the following summary describes factors we believe are material risks that apply to our business 
our discussions of these risks include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from results described in the forward looking statements 
in addition to the risks described below and investment risks that apply in the case of any financial institution  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed by other risks  including risks we have not yet identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely 
risks related to our business our business strategy includes the continuation of our growth plans  and our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected if we fail to manage our growth effectively 
we intend to continue to grow in our existing banking markets internally and through additional offices and to expand into new markets as appropriate opportunities arise 
for that reason  our business prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that are experiencing growth 
we cannot assure you we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets  or that expansion will not adversely affect our operating results 
failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  future prospects  financial condition or operating results  and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy 
also  if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated  or declines  our operating results could be materially affected in an adverse way 
our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors  including continued availability of desirable business opportunities and the competitive response from other financial institutions 
due to personnel and fixed asset costs of de novo branching  any new branch offices we establish may operate at a loss until we can establish a sufficient base of business to operate profitably 
also  in establishing a new office in a new market  we likely would be faced with competitors with greater knowledge of that local market 
although we believe we have management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth  we will need to hire and rely on well trained local managers who have local affiliations and to whom we may need to give significant autonomy 
we cannot assure you that any de novo or other branch office we establish will not  for some period of time  operate at a loss and have an adverse effect on our earnings  that we will be able to hire managers who can successfully operate any new branch offices  or that we will become an effective competitor in any new banking market 
expanding our business through acquisitions involves risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition or the market value of our stock  and could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders 
in the future  we may acquire other institutions  or branches of other institutions  that complement or expand our business 
however  acquisitions and mergers involve a number of risks  including the risk that we incur substantial costs in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners  or in evaluating new markets  our estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks relating to target institutions may not be accurate  our issuance of additional common stock in an acquisition could dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders and reduce the market value of their stock  there may be substantial lag time between completing an acquisition and generating sufficient assets and deposits to support costs of the expansion  we are not be able to finance an acquisition  or the financing we obtain may have an adverse effect on our operating results or dilution to our existing shareholders  our management s attention in negotiating a transaction and integrating the operations and personnel of the combining businesses is diverted from our existing business  we are not able to successfully integrate any financial institution or its banking offices that we acquire into our operations  we experience disruption and incur unexpected expenses in acquisitions we complete  we enter new markets where we lack local experience  we introduce new products and services we are not equipped to manage  we incur goodwill in connection with an acquisition  or the goodwill we incur becomes impaired  which results in adverse short term effects on our operating results  or after completing an acquisition  we lose key employees and customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate  finance or complete any acquisitions  or that any acquisition we complete will benefit us 
any of these things could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our business depends on the condition of the local and regional economies where we operate 
we currently have offices only in the piedmont area of north carolina 
consistent with our community banking philosophy  a majority of our customers are located in and do business in that region  and we lend a substantial portion of our capital and deposits to commercial and consumer borrowers in our local banking markets 
therefore  our local and regional economy has a direct impact on our ability to generate deposits to support loan growth  the demand for loans  the ability of borrowers to repay loans  the value of collateral securing our loans particularly loans secured by real estate  and our ability to collect  liquidate and restructure problem loans 
if the economies of our banking markets are adversely affected by a general economic downturn or by other specific events or trends  the resulting economic impact could have a direct adverse effect on our operating results 
adverse economic conditions in our banking markets could reduce our growth rate  affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us  and generally affect our financial condition and operating results 
we are less able than larger institutions to spread risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies 
and  we cannot assure you that we will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in our banking markets even if they do occur 
a large percentage of our loans are secured by real estate 
adverse conditions in the real estate market in our banking markets might adversely affect on our loan portfolio 
any adverse market or economic conditions in north carolina  particularly in the real estate market  may have an adverse affect on our loan portfolio 
on december   approximately of the total dollar amount of our loan portfolio was secured by liens on real estate 
our management believes that  in the case of many of those loans  the real estate collateral is not being relied upon as the primary source of repayment  and those relatively high percentages reflect  at least in part  our policy to take real estate whenever possible as primary or additional collateral rather than other types of collateral 
however  adverse changes in the values of real estate in our banking markets caused by market or economic conditions that affect our loan portfolio could have an adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition 
the fdic recently adopted rules aimed at placing additional monitoring and management controls on financial institutions whose loan portfolios are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate cre 
at december   our loan portfolio exceeded thresholds established by the fdic for cre concentrations and for additional regulatory scrutiny 
preliminary indications from regulators are that strict limitations on the amount or percentage of cre within any given portfolio are not expected  but  rather  that additional reporting and analysis will be required to document management s analysis and evaluation of the potential additional risks of such concentrations and the impact of any mitigating factors 
while the final impact of the new rules on us has not been determined  it is possible that regulatory constraints associated with these rules could adversely affect our ability to grow loan assets and thereby limit our overall growth and expansion plans 
these rules also could increase the costs of monitoring and managing this component of our loan portfolio 
either of these eventualities could have an adverse impact on our earnings and capital ratios 
our recent results may not be indicative of our future results 
we may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or even grow our business at all 
in the future  we may not have the benefit of several recently favorable factors  such as a generally stable interest rate environment  a strong residential mortgage market  or the ability to find suitable expansion opportunities 
various factors  such as economic conditions  regulatory and legislative considerations  and competition also may impede or restrict our ability to expand our market presence 
if we experience a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth  our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected because a high percentage of our operating costs are fixed expenses 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future in order to continue to grow  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
federal and state banking regulators require us to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
on december   our three capital ratios were well above well capitalized levels under bank regulatory guidelines 
however  our business strategy calls for us to continue to grow in our existing banking markets internally and through additional offices and to expand into new markets as appropriate opportunities arise 
growth in our earning assets resulting from internal expansion and new branch offices  at rates in excess of the rate at which our capital is increased through retained earnings  will reduce our capital ratios unless we continue to increase our capital 
if our capital ratios fell below well capitalized levels  our fdic deposit insurance assessment rate would increase until we restored and maintained our capital at a well capitalized level 
a higher assessment rate would cause an increase in the assessments we pay the fdic for deposit insurance  which would adversely affect our operating results 
if  in the future  we need to increase our capital to fund additional growth or satisfy regulatory requirements  our ability to raise that additional capital will depend on conditions at that time in the capital markets that are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired 
our profitability is subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
changes in interest rates can have different effects on various aspects of our business  particularly our net interest income 
our profitability depends  to a large extent  on our net interest income  which is the difference between our income on interest earning assets and our expense on interest bearing deposits and other liabilities 
like most financial institutions  we are affected by changes in general interest rate levels and by other economic factors beyond our control 
interest rate risk arises in part from the mismatch ie  the interest sensitivity gap between the dollar amounts of repricing or maturing interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and is measured in terms of the ratio of the interest rate sensitivity gap to total assets 
when more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities will reprice or mature over a given time period  a bank is considered asset sensitive and has a positive gap 
when more liabilities than assets will reprice or mature over a given time period  a bank is considered liability sensitive and has a negative gap 
a liability sensitive position ie  a negative gap may generally enhance net interest income in a falling interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
an asset sensitive position ie  a positive gap may generally enhance net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a falling interest rate environment 
our ability to manage our gap position determines to a great extent our ability to operate profitably 
however  fluctuations in interest rates are not predictable or controllable  and we cannot assure you we will be able to manage our gap position in a manner that will allow us to remain profitable 
competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability 
commercial banking in our banking markets and in north carolina as a whole is extremely competitive 
we compete against commercial banks  credit unions  savings and loan associations  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market funds and other mutual funds  as well as other local and community  super regional  national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our market areas and elsewhere 
we compete with these institutions in attracting deposits and in making loans  and we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents 
our larger competitors have greater resources  broader geographic markets  and higher lending limits than we do  and they can offer more products and services and better afford and more effectively use media advertising  support services and electronic technology than we can 
while we believe we compete effectively with other financial institutions  we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our size  lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread marketing costs across a broader market 
although we compete by concentrating our marketing efforts in our primary markets with local advertisements  personal contacts and greater flexibility and responsiveness in working with local customers  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be an effective competitor in our banking markets 
we are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our earnings 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies 
our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities  including payment of dividends  mergers and acquisitions  investments  loans and interest rates charged  interest rates paid on deposits  and locations of offices 
we also are subject to capital guidelines established by our regulators which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth 
many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors  the public and the fdic s deposit insurance fund rather than shareholders 
the sarbanes oxley act of  and the related rules and regulations issued by the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq stock market  have increased the scope  complexity and cost of corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices  including the costs of completing our audit and maintaining our internal controls 
the laws and regulations that apply to us could change at any time  and we cannot predict the effects of those changes on our business and profitability 
government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies  and our cost of compliance could adversely affect our earnings 
we depend on the services of our current management team 
our operating results and our ability to adequately manage our growth and minimize loan losses are highly dependent on the services  managerial abilities and performance of our current executive officers 
smaller banks  like us  sometimes find it more difficult to attract and retain experienced management personnel than larger banks 
we have an experienced management team that our board of directors believes is capable of managing and growing the bank 
however  changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may disrupt our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need to invest in new technology to compete effectively  and that could have a negative effect on our operating results and the value of our common stock 
the market for financial services  including banking services  is increasingly affected by advances in technology  including developments in telecommunications  data processing  computers  automation and internet based banking 
we depend on third party vendors for our data processing services 
in addition to our ability to finance the purchase of those services and integrate them into our operations  our ability to offer new technology based services depends on our vendors abilities to provide and support those services 
future advances in technology may require us to incur substantial expenses that adversely affect our operating results  and our small size and limited resources may make it impractical or impossible for us to keep pace with our larger competitors 
our ability to compete successfully in our banking markets may depend on the extent to which we and our vendors are able to offer new technology based services and on our ability to integrate technological advances into our operations 
risks related to our common stock the trading volume in our common stock has been low  and the sale of a substantial number of shares in the public market could depress the price of our stock and make it difficult for you to sell your shares 
our common stock has been listed on the nasdaq stock market since december  and it currently is listed on the nasdaq capital market 
however  our common stock is thinly traded 
thinly traded stock can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market 
we cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and market prices for the stock of many companies have experienced wide price fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to operating performance 
we cannot predict what effect future sales of our common stock in the market  or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale in the market  will have on the market price of our common stock 
so  we cannot assure you that sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market  or the potential for large amounts of market sales  would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our ability to raise capital 
our ability to pay dividends is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends 
our ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital 
also  our only source of funds with which to pay dividends to our shareholders is dividends we receive from the bank  and the bank s ability to pay dividends to us is limited by its own obligations to maintain sufficient capital and regulatory restrictions 
if these regulatory requirements are not satisfied  we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock 
item b 
unresolved staff comments 
none item properties 
we own the facilities housing five of our banking offices  and we lease the facilities housing our remaining three offices 
in addition  we own an operations center which houses the deposit operations  information technology and loan administration departments of the bank 
each of our banking offices is in good condition and fully equipped for our purposes 
on december   our investment in premises and equipment cost less accumulated depreciation was approximately million 
item legal proceedings 
from time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of our business 
we believe there currently are no pending or threatened proceedings that are likely to result in a material adverse change in our financial condition or operations  subject to the uncertainties inherent in any litigation

the following presents management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion is intended to assist in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations  and it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
all share data have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to stock splits and stock dividends 
bank of the carolinas corporation the company is a north carolina chartered bank holding company that was incorporated on may   for the sole purpose of serving as the parent bank holding company for the bank 
the bank is an insured  north carolina chartered bank that began operations on december   under the name bank of davie 
on august   we completed a corporate reorganization and share exchange in which the bank became our wholly owned bank subsidiary 
because the company has no operations and conducts no business on its own other than owning bank of carolinas the bank  the discussion contained in these footnotes concerns primarily the business of the bank 
however  for ease of reading and because the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis  the company and its subsidiary are collectively referred to herein as the company unless otherwise noted 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the notes to our audited financial statements for the years ended december   and contain a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe our policies with respect to methodology for the determination of our allowance for loan losses  and our asset impairment judgments  such as the recoverability of the intangible assets  involve a higher degree of complexity and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
accordingly  we consider the policies related to those areas critical 
our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  the present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market  and the loan balance 
the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to income 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which those loans  in our opinion  become uncollectible 
recoveries during the period are credited to the allowance 
the factors that influence our judgment in determining the amount charged to non interest expense include past loan experience  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s determination of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses 
this model has several components 
the first component involves the estimation of losses on loans defined as impaired loans 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the estimated valuation allowance is the difference  if any  between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan s effective rate  or in the case of a collateral dependent loan  the fair value of the collateral 
the second component of the allowance model is to estimate losses for risk graded loans  which consist of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans 
these loans are assigned estimated loss percentages based on their risk grade 
the third component of the allowance model is to estimate losses on homogeneous pools of loans 
these pools consist primarily of single family residential loans  consumer loans  and equity lines of credit 
the allowance for these pools is based on the historical loss experience and average life of these portfolios 
finally there is a general component in the allowance for losses inherent in the graded loans and homogeneous pools based on several additional risk factors 
we review our allowance on a quarterly basis and believe that the allowance is appropriate to cover inherent loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
however  the determination of the allowance using our procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that we will not  in any particular period  sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amounts reserved for those loans  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio and our allowance  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their routine examination process  periodically review our allowance 
those agencies may require that we make additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
accounting for intangible assets is as prescribed by sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for recognized intangible assets based on their estimated useful lives 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized  while intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
currently  our recognized intangible asset consists of goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to fair value impairment tests on at least an annual basis 
if based upon our evaluation impairment has occurred  the impairment charge is recognized at that time 
based on the evaluation and testing described above  we have determined that our recorded goodwill is not impaired 
overview during the year  our assets increased by million to million at december  from million at year end our net income increased to million from million for a large portion of this increase was attributable to the sale of our carthage branch to first bank during the sale of this branch produced a gain of million pre tax for the bank during the bank did experience significant growth of nearly million in its loan portfolio during however even with this growth the bank  along with most other community banks  has struggled to maintain its net interest margins in this current interest rate environment and will most likely continue to face those same challenges in we continued to expand our franchise by opening a new branch in early in winston salem  our first in the city 
the bank has also received regulatory approval to open a branch in the concord area 
the bank has taken possession of one of our other real estate properties and plans to renovate this building as our branch location 
we plan to complete this process during during the year  the bank s board of directors approved the formation of a bank holding company of which the bank became its wholly owned subsidiary 
the reorganization was completed in august the reorganization was effected through a share exchange in which each of the bank s shareholders received one share of common stock of bankcorp in exchange for each of their shares of the bank s common stock 
we strive to serve the financial needs of small to medium sized businesses  individuals  and residential homebuilders  offering a broad array of banking and other financial products emphasizing superior customer service 
real estate secured loans  including construction loans and loans secured by existing commercial and residential properties  comprise the majority of our loan portfolio  with the balance of our loans consisting of commercial and industrial loans and loans to individuals 
we also offer certain loan products through associations with various mortgage lending companies 
through these associations  we originate family residential mortgages  at both fixed and variable rates 
we earn fees for originating these loans and transferring the loan package to the mortgage lending companies 
it has been our strategy to recruit skilled banking professionals who are well trained and highly knowledgeable about our market area  enabling us to develop and maintain a loan portfolio of sound credit quality 
the deposit services we offer include small business and personal checking accounts  savings accounts  money market checking accounts and certificates of deposit 
the bank concentrates on providing customer service to build its customer deposit base and competes aggressively in the area of transaction accounts 
additional funding includes borrowings from the federal home loan bank and from federal funds purchased lines of credit 
our results of operations are heavily dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also materially affected by our provision for loan losses  fee income generated from deposit and loan accounts  and noninterest expenses 
our noninterest expense primarily consists of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy expense  professional services  advertising  and other noninterest expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  changes in interest rates  and actions of regulatory and governmental authorities 
financial condition at december  and december  total assets at december   increased by million or to million compared to million at december  we had earning assets of million at december  consisting of million in gross loans  million in investment securities and million in overnight investments 
stockholders equity was million at december  compared to million at december  loans 
gross loans grew by million or during the twelve months of  from million on december  to million at december  on december   real estate loans were  and commercial loans were of the total loan portfolio 
gross loans represented and of our total assets on december   and december   respectively 
interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  maturity and amount of the loan 
competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government regulation also influence interest rates 
on average  our loan portfolio yielded for the period ending december  as compared to an average yield of during we intend to continue the growth of high quality loan assets to the extent permitted by our capital 
with continued expansion of our geographic market area and the strong acceptance of our products and services within the communities we serve  we expect loan growth to continue at its current rate

we are required to maintain an allowance for loan losses that reflects the size and risk in our loan portfolio 
this has made it necessary for us to make significant provisions for loan losses  which principally reflect the growth of the loan portfolio 
we expect our loan growth to continue at its current rate and that our provisions for loan losses will continue to be a major portion of our non interest expense

asset quality 
certain credit risks are inherent in making loans  particularly commercial and consumer loans 
we assess these risks and attempt to manage them effectively 
we also attempt to reduce credit risk by adhering to internal credit underwriting policies and procedures 
these policies and procedures include officer and customer limits  periodic loan documentation review and follow up on exceptions to credit policies 
a loan is placed in a non accrual status when  in our judgment  the collection of interest appears doubtful 
nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans contractually past due for more than days but still accruing interest  and foreclosed or idled properties 
on december   we had loans with an aggregate principal balance of million that were delinquent over days  of which million were in non accrual status 
interest accrued  but not recognized as income on non accrual loans  was approximately  at december  on the same date  we had total nonperforming assets of million  which includes other real estate owned 
other real estate owned at december   totaled million and consisted of four properties 
other real estate owned is carried on the balance sheet at values that we feel are less than or equal to the net amounts we will receive for the properties when they are sold

net interest income 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between income generated by our interest earning assets primarily loans  investment securities  and interest bearing balances and the expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits and borrowed funds used to fund earning assets 
net interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million in and million at december  our net interest margin and net interest spread decreased to and  respectively  in from and  respectively  for the same period of a better rate and more normal yield curve environment in led to a net interest margin and net interest spread of and in  respectively 
the changes were largely due to the fact that while average interest earning assets grew million during the year  average interest bearing liabilities also grew by million 
this nearly identical growth in assets and liabilities coupled with an increase of basis points on the assets versus basis points for the liabilities led to the slight decrease in the margins 
our net interest income is affected by both the difference between the rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

provision for loan losses remained relatively flat during the year at million only increasing  over the amount which increased  from the amount 
this was mainly due to a better than expected outcome on some properties that had been deemed impaired

nonperforming loans as a percentage of net loans increased to at december  from 
at december  and 
at december  provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level we deem appropriate 
in evaluating the allowance for loan losses  we consider factors that include growth  composition and industry diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current delinquency levels  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors 
non interest income 
in addition to net interest income  we derive revenues from a variety of financial products and services offered to our customers 
the majority of our non interest income results from service charges on our deposit accounts  including charges for insufficient funds  check sales  and fees charged for non deposit services and from mortgage loan broker fees 
also in  we started an investment sales division which generated  of non interest income for the bank in non interest income increased by  or for the year ended december   exclusive of a million dollar gain on the sale of our carthage branch

we incurred income tax expense of million in and million in in  income tax expense was of pretax earnings as compared to for the increase in the effective tax rate in was largely due to a higher effective state tax rate in capital adequacy we are required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fdic has issued risk based capital and leverage capital guidelines for measuring the adequacy of a bank s capital  and all applicable capital standards must be satisfied for us to be considered in compliance with the fdic s requirements 
on december   our total capital ratio and tier capital ratio were and  respectively  which were well above the minimum levels required by the fdic s guidelines 
on december   our leverage capital ratio was  which was also well above the minimum level required by the fdic s guidelines 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity 
maintaining adequate liquidity  while managing interest rate risk  is the primary goal of our asset and liability management strategy 
liquidity is the ability to fund the needs of our borrowers and depositors  pay operating expenses and meet regulatory requirements 
maturing investments  loan repayments  deposit growth and borrowing from the federal home loan bank are presently the main sources of the bank s liquidity 
the bank s primary uses of liquidity are to fund loans  operating expenses  deposit withdrawals  repay borrowings and to make investments 
interest rate sensitivity 
our goal is to maintain a neutral position on interest rate sensitivity whereby little or no change in interest income would occur as interest rates change 
on december   we were cumulatively liability sensitive for the next twelve months  which means that our interest bearing liabilities would reprice more quickly than our interest bearing assets 
theoretically  our net interest margin will decline if market interest rates rise or increase if market interest rates fall 
however  the repricing characteristic of assets is different from the repricing characteristics of funding sources 
therefore  net interest income can be impacted by changes in interest rates even if the repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities are perfectly matched 
the following table shows the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet on december   and december   but are not necessarily indicative of our position on other dates 
each category of assets and liabilities is shown with projected repricing and maturity dates 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets or liabilities 
loans with adjustable rates are shown as being due at the end of the next upcoming adjustment period 
now accounts  savings accounts  and money market accounts are assumed to be subject to immediate repricing and depositor availability 
prepayment assumptions on mortgage loans and decay rates on deposit accounts have not been included in this analysis 
also  the table does not reflect scheduled principal repayments that will be received on loans 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities may vary substantially if different assumptions are used or if our actual experience differs from that indicated by the assumptions

as a result  a bank s performance may be significantly influenced by changes in interest rates 
although the banking industry is more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation in the price of goods and services  inflation also is a factor that may influence interest rates 
yet  the frequency and magnitude of interest rate fluctuations do not necessarily coincide with changes in the general inflation rate 
inflation does affect our operating expense in that personnel expense and the cost of supplies and outside services tend to increase more during periods of high inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market price and interest rate risks 
interest rate risk is the result of differing maturities or re pricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the fact that rates on these financial instruments do not change uniformly 
these changes can have a direct impact on the company s overall earnings 
the current structure of the company s balance sheet is such that a significant increase in interest rates may positively impact net interest income 
management of the company actively monitors interest rate risk through the development of and adherence to the company s asset liability management policy 
the company has also established an asset liability management committee alco which monitors interest rate risk exposure  liquidity and funding strategies to ensure that their potential impact is within standards
