the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition contains statements relating to our future results  including certain projections and trends  which constitute forward looking statements 
certain risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to be materially different from projected results contained in these forward looking statements and other disclosures 
these risks and uncertainties are more fully described under forward looking statements and exposures below 
as used herein  unless otherwise required by the context  the term grant prideco refers to grant prideco  inc and the terms we  our  and similar words refer to grant prideco and its subsidiaries 
the use herein of such terms as group  organization  we  us  our and its  or references to specific entities  are not intended to be a precise description of corporate relationships 
general we are the world leader in drill stem technology development and drill pipe manufacturing  sales and service  a global leader in drill bit technology and specialty tools  manufacturing  sales and service  and a leading provider of high performance engineered connections and premium tubular products and services 
we operate primarily through three business segments drilling products and services  reedhycalog and tubular technology and services 
additionally  our corporate and other segment includes the results of intelliserv  in which we acquired the remaining interest in september license and royalty agreement in september  we entered into a technology licensing agreement with a competitor to use reedhycalog s patented technology for the shallow leaching of pdc cutters in exchange for million in guaranteed non refundable and non cancelable payments million was paid in october with the remaining million paid in january and future royalty payments 
as we have no remaining obligations under the agreement as performance has been completed  we recognized million as license and royalty income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in beginning on april   we will be paid  on a quarterly basis  a royalty determined on actual licensed drill bits invoiced by the competitor 
we will recognize these royalties as income in the period the competitor sells our licensed drill bits 
acquisitions on october   we acquired anderson group ltd 
and related companies collectively  andergauge for approximately million  including cash acquired and a non interest bearing note payable of million  plus the assumption of net debt of approximately million and related transaction expenses 
the debt assumed was repaid in connection with the acquisition with cash on hand and through the use of a draw under our credit facility

andergauge  based in aberdeen  scotland  is a provider of specialized downhole drilling tools  including the anderreamer and agi tator  and provides services related to these tools 
we recorded goodwill of million  which is not deductible for tax purposes  and intangible assets of million for customer relationships and million for patents 
the customer relationships and patents are being amortized over and years  respectively 
the purchase price for the andergauge acquisition has been allocated to the fair values of net assets acquired 
andergauge s results of operations are included in the reedhycalog segment from the date of acquisition 
in june  in connection with the purchase of the remaining interest of grant prideco jiangsu gpj mentioned below  we created jiangsu grant prideco oil and gas equipment co  ltd 
jgp  a wholly owned chinese entity 
during  we funded approximately million into jgp for the purpose of fulfilling its commitment to provide investments in china  of which million relates to the prepayment of a year land use agreement 
the prepayment amount is being amortized over the life of the lease agreement 
we purchased the remaining interest in gpj effective october  for million in cash and a commitment to make subsequent investments in china 
additionally  we entered into a year non compete agreement with one of the selling shareholders for million 
on september   we acquired the remaining interest in intelliserv for million in cash plus a non interest bearing note payable of million which was discounted to million based on our incremental borrowing rate of  of which million was paid january and million was paid january additional contingent consideration could be paid based on the product s adoption rate and revenues 
as of december   no additional contingent consideration has been paid 
the purchase agreement limits the total contingent consideration to million 
intelliserv  located in provo  utah  has developed a drill string telemetry system that is in the early stages of commercialization 
on july   we acquired substantially all of the assets of corion  a coring business headquartered in edmonton  alberta  canada for approximately million in cash with up to an additional million payable upon achieving certain performance benchmarks 
as of december   no additional consideration has been paid  however  in february a payment of million was made based upon achieving certain performance benchmarks related to the year ended december  an additional million could be paid out over the next two years based on corion s performance in and corion s flagship product is the corion express  which allows an operator to drill and core without tripping the pipe  providing substantial operational savings compared with conventional coring techniques 
refinancing charges in  we completed a comprehensive debt restructuring program to decrease interest expense and improve flexibility 
in connection with the debt restructuring program  we incurred total refinancing charges of million  which includes million related to replacing our previous million credit facility with a new million credit facility and an early redemption of our million senior notes due and million related to the repurchase of substantially all of our senior notes 
the million is comprised of million for the make whole premium on the senior notes  million related to the write off of debt issue costs associated with the previous credit facility and the senior notes  including the senior note s discount  and million related to the settlement of treasury rate locks

market trends our business depends primarily on the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling activity  which is directly related to the level of capital spending by major  independent and state owned exploration and production companies 
changes in the level of capital spending by those exploration and production companies  which are based on their expectations of future oil and gas prices  create cycles in drilling activity 
the revenues  cash flows and profitability of our business segments generally tracks the level of domestic and international drilling activity  but the timing of that effect is often different for each of our segments 
drill pipe demand is also a function of customer inventory levels and typically lags changes in the worldwide rig count 
in a declining market  customers are contractually required to purchase ordered drill pipe even if they will no longer have an immediate need for pipe 
this creates a situation where some customers have an inventory of excess drill pipe 
drill bit demand and that segment s earnings and cash flows have closely tracked the worldwide rig count 
within our tubular technology and services segment  there are four product lines atlas bradford premium connections  tube alloy accessories  tca premium casing and xl systems large bore connections and services 
results for this segment s atlas bradford  tube alloy and tca product lines predominantly follow changes in premium tubular markets  including north american offshore drilling in particular  the gulf of mexico and deep us gas drilling  but short term demand for atlas bradford and tca products also can be affected by inventories at oil country tubular goods octg distributors 
this segment s xl systems product line generally follows the level of worldwide offshore drilling activity 
during the periods below  the revenues  profitability and cash flows from each of our business segments were impacted by changes in oil prices  gas prices and rig counts 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to oil and gas prices at the dates indicated and the north american us and canadian and international rig counts for the periods reflected year ended december  wti oil a average ending henry hub gas b average ending north american rig count c average ending international rig count c average ending a price per barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude as of the dates presented above 
source bloomberg energy commodity service 
b price per mmbtu as of the dates presented above 
source bloomberg energy commodity service 
c source baker hughes rig count international rig count excludes china and the former soviet union 
future market trends and expectations we anticipate future results will be based on the level of drilling activity and our customers views regarding the sustainability of that activity 
these perceptions depend on their views regarding oil and natural gas prices 
when forecasting our performance  we relied on assumptions about the market for these commodities  our customers and suppliers and our backlog and past results 
these indicators point to increased performance in recently  however  increasing inventories of oil and us natural gas  as well as other supply and demand factors  have driven prices for these commodities lower 
despite this decline in commodity prices  we have not yet seen any significant changes in our customer s spending plans 
therefore  we expect drilling activity in to be similar to the strong average worldwide drilling activity levels experienced in using these indicators and assumptions  we anticipate that earnings will be in the range of to per diluted share  excluding any unusual items 
our results could materially differ from these forecasts if any of our assumptions  such as customer expectations of commodity price strength or drilling activity  prove to be incorrect 
in addition  our businesses operations  financial condition and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that if realized could cause our actual results to differ substantially from our forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties are further described in item a

recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to measure eligible assets and liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the new statement provides a single definition of fair value  together with a framework for measuring it  and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
we are assessing the potential impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 
sfas no 
requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension plans to recognize the funded status of their defined benefit pension plans in the statement of financial position  measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end statement of financial position  and provide additional disclosures 
on december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
the effect of adopting sfas no 
on our financial statements at december  has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements at december  or sfas no 
s provisions regarding the change in the measurement date of defined benefit pension plans are not applicable as we already use a measurement date of december for our defined benefit pension plans 
see critical accounting policies and estimates for further discussion of the effect of adopting sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
the guidance in sab must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  we adopted sab at december  and it did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  consistent with its requirements  we will adopt fin on january  we do not believe the adoption of fin will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf abstract issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
taxes within the scope of eitf include any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include  but are not limited to  sales taxes  use taxes  value added taxes and some excise taxes 
the eitf concluded that the presentation of these taxes on either a gross included in revenues and costs or a net excluded from revenue basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions of eitf are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we generally record our tax assessed revenue transactions on a net basis in our consolidated statements of operations and therefore  we do not anticipate that eitf will have a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these judgments and assumptions 
revenue recognition our revenues are primarily comprised of product sales  rentals and services 
revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria have been met a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c delivery to and acceptance by the customer has occurred or services have been rendered  d no significant contractual obligations remain to be completed or performed and e collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues associated with rebillable shipping costs 
if requested in writing by the customer  delivery may be satisfied through delivery to our customer storage location or to a third party storage facility 
for sales transactions where title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer but the supporting documentation does not meet all of the criteria for revenue recognition prior to the products being in the physical possession of the customer  the recognition of the revenues and related inventory costs from these transactions are deferred until the customer takes physical possession 
at december   we had deferred revenues and charges related to such transactions of million and million  respectively 
at december   we had deferred revenues and charges related to such transactions of million and million  respectively 
we also have deferred revenues related to customer advances which were million and million at december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revised standard that establishes accounting for stock based payment transactions when a company receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments 
prior to  we accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we also complied with the pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
the provisions of apb no 
required compensation expense to be recognized in operations for restricted stock  but did not require expense recognition for unvested stock options or for awards granted under the employee stock purchase plan espp as we issued options at exercise prices equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant and because our espp was noncompensatory 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share for the stock options and espp awards were instead disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements 
under the new standard  companies are required to account for stock based compensation using the fair value of equity awards at the grant date  with the fair value recognized in operations during the employee s requisite service period typically the vesting period 
additionally  compensation cost is recognized based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  therefore  the compensation cost recognized on stock options is reduced for estimated forfeitures based on our historical forfeiture rates 
we elected to use the modified prospective application transition method set out in sfas no 
r 
that method requires recognition of compensation expense for stock based payment awards that are granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after compensation expense for unvested stock options outstanding as of january  for which the requisite service has not been rendered is being recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost previously calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r  the balance in unearned compensation recorded in stockholders equity as of january   of million was reclassified to and reduced the balance of capital in excess of par value 
prior periods were not restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard 
adoption of the new standard resulted in decreases for the year ended december  in income before income taxes of million  net income of and reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by approximately per share 
additionally  no stock based compensation costs were capitalized 
there are various assumptions used when valuing stock options such as volatility and expected option term 
while we believe the assumptions used are supportable and reasonable under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions could have derived different fair values for recognizing stock option expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends  type of customer  the age of outstanding receivables and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and million  respectively 
the provision for bad debt expense  including recoveries and other adjustments  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions  however  uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 
inventories inventory costs are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we value our inventories primarily using standard costs  which approximate actual costs  that include raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead allocations 
we perform obsolescence reviews on our slow moving and excess inventories and establish reserves based on current assessments of factors such as age of inventory  technology obsolescence  future product demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if such factors are different than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
business combinations the cost of business acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition using third party appraisals and management estimates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain 
in addition  estimated liabilities to exit activities of an acquired operation or an existing operation  including the exiting of contractual obligations and the termination of employees  are subject to change as management continues its assessment of operations and finalizes its integration and exit plans 
valuation of long lived assets a review for impairment of long lived assets is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to expected undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset group 
if such asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less selling costs 
while we believe no impairments existed at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is subject to at least an annual impairment test and more frequently if circumstances indicate its value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each of our reporting units compared with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  a second step test is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the years expected to be benefited and are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value 
based on our annual goodwill impairment test as of october   we do not believe any of our goodwill was impaired as of december  while we believe no impairment existed at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will expire before realization of the benefit or that future deductibility is not probable 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future 
this requires us to use estimates and make assumptions regarding significant future events such as the taxable profitability of entities operating in the various taxing jurisdictions 
contingent liabilities we have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the actual costs of these liabilities or claims 
these liabilities and claims sometimes involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have been quantified and we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision to cover an expected loss based on our experience in these matters and  when appropriate  the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle a liability 
examples of areas where we have made important estimates of future liabilities primarily include litigation  warranty claims  environmental liabilities  contract claims and tax contingencies 
while management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  inherent limitations in the estimation process may cause future actual losses to exceed expected losses 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 
pension plans on december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize the funded status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of its pension plans in its balance sheet at december   with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss at adoption represents the reclassification of unrecognized actuarial gains losses and unrecognized prior service costs  all of which were previously netted against the plan s liabilities 
the amounts related to the pensions in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will subsequently be recognized as net periodic pension costs pursuant to our historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts 
further  actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension costs in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
those amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension costs on the same basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss at adoption of sfas no 
the incremental effects of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
on our consolidated balance sheet at december  are presented in the following table 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   or for any prior period presented  and it will not affect our operating results in future periods 
additionally  due to the status of our plans  the actual benefit obligations equaled the projected benefit obligations  therefore  there was no adjustment to the funded status of our plans as a result of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
prior to effect of as reported adopting adopting at sfas no 
sfas no 
december  in thousands other intangible assets  net other assets accrued labor and benefits deferred tax liabilities accumulated other comprehensive loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost unrecognized prior service costs of million million net of tax and unrecognized net actuarial gains of million million net of tax 
the prior service costs and actuarial gains included in accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be recognized in net periodic pension costs during the fiscal year ended december  are million million net of tax and million million net of tax  respectively 
no plan assets are expected to be returned to us during the fiscal year ended december  there are various assumptions used when determining the pension obligations such as discount rates and expected return on plan assets 
while we believe the assumptions used are supportable and reasonable under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions could have derived different pension obligations and fair value of plan assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that we enter into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
refer to note to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information on financial instruments 
foreign currency risk the functional currency for the majority of our international operations is the us dollar 
adjustments resulting from the remeasurment of the local currency financial statements into the us dollar functional currency  which uses a combination of current and historical exchange rates  are included in the consolidated statements of operations in other income expense  net in the current period 
the functional currency of our canadian  venezuelan and chinese operations is the local currency 
adjustments resulting from the translation of the local functional currency financial statements into the u 
s dollar  which is primarily based on current exchange rates  are included in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the current period 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions  such as those resulting from the settlement of foreign receivables or payables  are included other income expense  net  which includes our long term supply contract with vat that is denominated in euros 
net foreign currency gains losses for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
interest rates we are and will be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our long term debt 
the following table  which presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates and weighted average interest rates  summarizes our fixed rate debt obligations at december  and that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
thereafter in thousands long term debt fixed rate average interest rate thereafter long term debt fixed rate average interest rate as of december   we had fixed rate debt aggregating million and variable rate debt aggregating million 
the variable rate debt exposes us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates 
if the variable interest rate were to increase by from december levels  interest expense would increase by approximately million annually 
the carrying value of the variable interest rate debt approximates fair value as it bears interest at current market rates 
however  our fixed rate senior notes outstanding at december  subject us to risks related to changes in the fair value of the debt and exposes us to potential gains or losses if we were to repay or refinance such debt 
a change in market interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the fair value of our senior notes as compared to the carrying value at december  and  was as follows december  carrying fair carrying fair value value value value in millions senior notes due
