overview in we embarked on a new strategy  which was to become a leading regional provider of electronic security alarm monitoring services  providing service and electronic monitoring of alarm systems to residential single and multi family homes  financial institutions  industrial and commercial businesses and complexes  warehouses  facilities of government departments and healthcare and educational facilities  as well as installation of electronic security alarm systems 
we also have wholesale customers where we monitor security systems owned by independent security companies 
through our electronic security services division  we engage in the electronic monitoring of our installed base of security systems  as well as the installation of new monitored security systems added to our installed base  both in residential and commercial buildings 
in order to execute our new strategy  we began a process of reviewing in detail the operations of our materials and construction division  which were incurring operating losses 
this strategic review and shift in operational focus resulted in a series of acquisitions and divestitures which together allowed us to pursue our objective of becoming a leading regional provider of electronic security services 
the acquisitions and divestitures were as follows acquisitions on july   we acquired the issued and outstanding capital stock of sec

martin 
revenues from the materials division increased by million or as compared to as a result of the following this increase primarily occurred in the sint maarten operations  and was due to a large ready mix concrete project in that started in late million or increase in revenues for this project in over  the benefit of multiple price increases that started in july and continued throughout  and fewer shortages of cement in compared to revenues in st 
martin were positively impacted by prices increases  but these were offset by reduced operations due to the ongoing dispute with a vendor and landlord  petit 
construction division our construction division performed earthmoving  excavating  and filling operations  built golf courses  roads  and utility infrastructures  dredged waterways and constructed deep water piers and marinas  primarily in the caribbean 
we have historically provided these development services to both private enterprises and government agencies 
the revenue related to the work performed by our construction division is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
currently  the majority of our contracts are completed in less than one year 
the work is bid or negotiated at a fixed price or at a unit price where our fee is based upon the quantity of work performed and is often measured in yards  meters or tons rather than time or a time and materials basis 
revenues from the construction division decreased by million or as compared to as a result of the following this reduction resulted primarily from difficulties in obtaining bid bonds and temporary business licenses  as a foreign corporation  in the commonwealth of the bahamas

we also experienced capacity problems in our ability to manufacture sand at our st 
martin quarry which resulted in the need for us to import more sand from third party producers  and thus incur higher raw material  shipping and production costs 
the imported sand has certain characteristics that require an increase in the volume of sand and cement used in our ready mix operations to meet our quality control standards 
management has implemented an alternative sourcing strategy for cement  which it believes should help in minimizing potential outages in the future and has significantly curtailed selling our internally manufactured sand to third parties  which will provide higher quality  lower cost sand to our ready mix batch plant operations

liquidity and capital resources adequacy of capital resources we generally fund our working capital needs from operations and bank borrowings 
in the electronic security services business  monitoring services are typically billed in advance on either a monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
installations of new security systems for residential customers typically result in a net investment in the customer  whereas installations of new security systems for commercial projects typically have neutral to positive cash flow 
in the construction division  we have historically expended considerable funds for equipment  labor and supplies 
in the construction division  our capital needs have been greatest at the start of a new contract  since we generally must complete to days of work before receiving the first progress payment 
as a project continues  a portion of the progress billing has usually been withheld as retainage until the work is complete 
we sometimes provide long term financing to customers who have previously utilized our construction services 
during and  we financed  and  respectively  of construction contracts 
repayments by customers are due at different times within the next seven years

we purchase equipment as needed for our ongoing business operations 
this resulted in a net cash expenditure of million in during  we sold or disposed of land  leasehold improvements  buildings and equipment resulting in a gain of approximately million 
the net proceeds  consisting of cash and notes receivable were million 
the purchase of guardian accounted for million of cash usage 
net cash provided by financing activities was million mainly driven by borrowing 
our uses of cash over the next twelve months will be principally for working capital needs  capital expenditures and for debt service which consists primarily of estimated interest payments of million on our outstanding senior debt 
we estimate the capital expenditures will be million related to the integration of our back office systems onto a consistent platform and the refurbishment of one of our monitoring centers and million for our materials operation in sint maarten 
cash flows from discontinued operations are included in the consolidated statement of cash flows within operating  investing and financing activities 
the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to impact future liquidity or capital resources 
we believe we can fund our planned business activities during the next twelve months with the sources of cash described above 
debt and other obligations credit agreement 
on november   devcon security holdings  inc  a subsidiary of ours  or dsh entered into a stock purchase agreement with the sellers of the issued and outstanding capital stock of coastal under the terms of which dsh agreed to purchase all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of coastal for approximately million in cash  including transaction costs 
in order to obtain the necessary funds to complete the stock purchase  dsh and devcon security services corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of dsh  or dss  entered into a credit agreement with capitalsource  along with other lenders party to the credit agreement from time to time 
the capitalsource revolving credit facility which replaced the million senior secured revolving credit facility provided by certain lenders and cit financial usa  inc  provided a three year revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of  for the purpose of providing funds for permitted acquisitions  to refinance existing indebtedness  for the purchase and generation of alarm contracts  for the issuance of letters of credit and for other lawful purposes not prohibited by the credit agreement 
the borrowers agreed to secure all of their obligations under the loan documents relating to the credit agreement by granting to the lenders a security interest in and second priority perfected lien on substantially all of their existing and after acquired personal and real property and all capital stock owned by each borrower of each other borrower 
in addition  devcon international corp 
pledged to the lenders all of its capital stock of dss 
the interest rate on the outstanding obligations under the credit agreement is tied to the base rate plus a margin as specified therein or  at the borrowers option  to libor plus margin amounting to 
the potential interest rate spread is base rate plus to basis point or libor plus to basis points 
on march   we completed the acquisition of guardian in which the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of guardian for an estimated aggregate cash purchase price of approximately million  excluding transaction costs of million

securities purchase agreement 
on march   we issued to certain investors under the terms of a securities purchase agreement  dated as of february   an aggregate principal amount of million of notes along with warrants to acquire an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the notes required interest at a rate equal to per annum which rate increased to per annum in the event we failed to make payments required under the notes when due 
on october   under the terms of the securities purchase agreement  the private placement investors received  in exchange for the notes  an aggregate of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  of devcon with a liquidation preference equal to  convertible into common stock at a conversion price equal to per share for each share of series a convertible preferred stock 
the issuance of the new series a convertible preferred stock and of the warrants could cause the issuance of greater than of our outstanding shares of common stock upon the conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock and the exercise of the warrants 
the creation of a new class of preferred stock was subject to shareholder approval under florida law  while  for various reasons related to the potential issuance of greater than of our outstanding shares of common stock  the issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock required shareholder approval under the rules of nasdaq 
holders of more than of our common stock approved the foregoing 
the approval became effective after the securities and exchange commission rules and regulations relating to the delivery of an information statement on schedule c to our shareholders was satisfied 
see item business financings for a description of recent events concerning the series a convertible preferred stock  particularly with respect to our obligations to register the shares of our common stock underlying these securities and its potential impact on our liquidity position 
we have two key debt covenants that could affect liquidity 
we believe that we will remain in compliance with both covenants in debt performing rmr revolving credit facility series a convertible preferred stock as of february   we had eligible performing rmr of million and outstanding senior debt of million including accrued interest or a ratio of x 
our proforma leverage ratio test for the series a convertible preferred stock  which will be calculated on a net debt basis  including proforma cash from the construction sale and the million face value of the series a convertible preferred stock to performing rmr is x 
given the continued stability of our customer base and the associated performing rmr we believe that a material decline in either is unlikely during attrition rate revolving credit facility our six month annualized attrition ratio as of february  was compared to a maximum permitted ratio of 
our ratio is being negatively impacted by relatively higher attrition that occurred during september and october of this higher attrition was caused by the cancellation of a number of wholesale customers whose contracts were not able to be assigned to the buyer of our wholesale business and an increase in cancellations due to a downturn in the real estate market in florida 
our attrition rate trend over the last six months is as follows actual period attrition annualized monthly ratio accounts performing rmr september october november december january february related party notes

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  description of business and summary of accounting policies 
certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods 
we periodically review the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates 
the following discussion is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
revenue and cost recognition revenue in the electronic security services division for monitoring and maintenance services is recognized monthly as services are provided pursuant to the terms of subscriber contracts  which have prices that are fixed and determinable 
the company assesses the subscriber s ability to meet the contract terms  including meeting payment obligations  before entering into the contract 
deferred revenue results from customers who are billed for monitoring in advance of the period in which the services are provided  on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
the company follows staff accounting bulletin sab  which requires the company to defer certain installation revenue and expenses  primarily equipment  direct labor and direct and incremental sales commissions incurred 
the capitalized costs and revenues related to the installation are then amortized over the year life of an average customer relationship  on a straight line basis 
if the customer being monitored is disconnected prior to the expiration of the original expected life  the unamortized portion of the deferred installation services revenue and related deferred costs are recognized in the period the disconnection becomes effective 
in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the security service contracts that include both installation and monitoring services are considered a single unit of accounting 
revenue in the electronic security services division for installation services  for which no monitoring contract is connected  is recognized at the time the installation is completed 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures  are recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs  for which collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue relating to claims only when there exists a legal basis supported by objective and verifiable evidence and additional identifiable costs are incurred due to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control 
change orders resulting in incremental revenue are recognized when the change order is signed by the customer 
change orders which are deductive are recognized when the amount can be reliably estimated 
revenue for the materials division is recognized when the products are delivered fob destination  invoiced at a fixed price and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
provisions are recognized in the statement of operations for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
we estimate costs to complete our construction contracts based on experience from similar work in the past 
if the conditions of the work to be performed change or if the estimated costs are not accurately projected  the gross profit from construction contracts may vary significantly in the future 
the foregoing  as well as weather  stage of completion and mix of contracts at different margins  may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from management s review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
we consider the age of specific accounts and a customer s payment history 
for our construction and materials divisions  specific collateral given by the customer to secure the receivable is obtained when we determine necessary 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
provision for inventory obsolescence we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability arising from the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assessments about current and future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were to be less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
if the actual market demand surpasses the projected levels  inventory write downs are not reversed 
goodwill intangible asset our goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  we ceased amortizing goodwill effective december  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets relate to our electronic security services segment and are assessed for impairment annually on june th and  more frequently  if a triggering event occurs utilizing a valuation study 
in performing this assessment  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses  there is a risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated 
as of december  we were not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of goodwill for impairment 
potential impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated  is less than the carrying value of the reported unit 
the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied value 
the amount of the impairment to recognize  if any  is calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied value 
based upon the most recent assessment as of december   the estimated fair value of the goodwill exceeded the recorded value by approximately million 
management believes the most significant assumption which would have an effect on the estimated fair value of goodwill is the long term net attrition rate after considering customer price increases 
we estimate that a one percentage point increase in the long term net attrition rate would affect the fair value by approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

sfas no 
requires write downs to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
assets with a carrying value of million held and used by us at december   including property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used  a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated 
we believe that a one percent change in any material underlying assumptions would not by itself result in the need to impair an asset 
if the long lived assets are identified as being planned for disposal or sale  they would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
see note  impairment of long lived assets 
in  we continued to evaluate and analyze our operations in accordance with sfas no 
this analysis coupled with certain transactions that we entered into indicated that certain operating units were impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold construction equipment for less than the carrying value of the equipment resulting in an impairment charge  recorded in the third quarter of  of 
million 
subsequent to december   we began negotiating an agreement to sell the joint venture operations and the assets of devmat and  in anticipation of this sale  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of in march  we sold construction assets and  based on the net book value of those assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of the cash flow unit and impairment charge recorded in were as follows dollars in thousands impairment charge construction equipment construction housing project sint maarten devmat joint venture operations construction assets total asset impairment charge in  based on continued operating losses and an undiscounted forecast of future cash flows prepared at the cash flow unit  there were a number of operations for which an impairment charge was necessary 
the cash flow unit and impairment charge recorded in were as follows dollars in thousands impairment materials division on st 
martin construction division devmat joint venture operations total asset impairment charge customer accounts are stated at fair value based on the discounted cash flows over the estimated life of the customer contracts and relationships 
the company uses a valuation study at the time of acquisition to determine the value and estimated life of customer accounts purchased in order to determine an appropriate method by which to amortize the acquired asset 
the amortization life is based on historic analysis of customer relationships combined with estimates of expected future revenues from customer accounts 
the company amortizes customer accounts on a straight line basis over the expected life of the customer contracts  which varies from four to seventeen years  and records an additional charge equal to the remaining unamortized value of the customer account when customers discontinue service before the end of the expected life 
the additional charge for discontinued accounts is equal to the remaining net book value of the customer contract and relationship for the specific customer account canceled 
customer accounts are tested on a periodic basis or as circumstances warrant 
for purposes of this impairment testing  goodwill is considered to be directly related to the acquired customer accounts 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following high levels of customer attrition  continuing recurring losses above our expectations  and adverse regulatory rulings 
an impairment test of customer accounts would have to be performed when the undiscounted expected future operating cash flows by asset group  which consists primarily of capitalized customer accounts and related goodwill  is less than the carrying value of that asset group 
an impairment would be recognized if the fair value of the customer accounts is less than the net book value of customer accounts 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when it is deemed more likely than not that future taxable income will not be sufficient to realize income tax benefits 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require adjustments to our deferred tax assets 
we have established tax accruals for tax contingencies including those as a result of various tax audits currently in process 
the amount of income taxes due as a result of the eventual outcome of these audits could differ from the amount of the estimated tax accruals 
subsidiaries located in us possessions and foreign countries file individual income tax returns 
us income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings  which are expected to be permanently reinvested by foreign subsidiaries  unless the earnings can be repatriated in a tax free or cash flow neutral manner 
contingencies estimated losses from contingencies are expensed if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
gain contingencies are not reflected in the financial statements until realized 
we use judgment in assessing whether a loss contingency is probable and estimable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
derivative financial instruments we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
however  the spa and certificate of designations governing the issuance of our series a convertible preferred stock provide for warrants and a right to purchase our series a convertible preferred stock that required it to be bifurcated and separately valued from the host instrument with which they relate 
we recognize these derivatives as liabilities on our balance sheet and measure them at their estimated fair value  and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in earnings in the period of change 
we valued the warrants and the right to purchase at march   their date of issuance  using an appropriate option pricing model the model 
the model determined an million aggregate value for these derivatives and this value was recorded as a derivative instrument liability and classified as current or long term in accordance with respective maturity dates 
the following embedded derivatives were identified within the series a convertible preferred stock i the ability to convert the series a convertible preferred stock into common stock  ii our option to satisfy dividends payable on the series a convertible preferred stock in common stock in lieu of cash  iii the potential increase in the dividend rate of the series a convertible preferred stock in the event a certain level of net cash proceeds from the sale of the our construction and material division assets are not realized with in a specified time frame and iv a change in control redemption right 
the embedded derivatives within the series a convertible preferred stock were bifurcated and valued as a single compound derivative when the series a convertible preferred stock was issued in october we estimated that the embedded derivatives had an estimated fair value of approximately million as of december  the embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on changes in the price and volatility of our common stock and are re valued at each balance sheet date with the resulting change in value being recorded as a charge or credit to arrive at net loss income 
over the life of the series a convertible preferred stock  given the historical volatility of our common stock  changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are expected to have a material effect on our results of operations 
furthermore  we have estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives using the model which considers the historical volatility of our common stock over the past twelve months of 
as a result  during the year ended december   we recognized income of million due to the change in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that we recognize in our consolidated financial statements  the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also requires expanded disclosures  including identification of tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months  a description of tax years that remain subject to examinations by major tax jurisdiction  a tabular reconciliation of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of each annual reporting period  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate and the total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the statement of operations and financial position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of the calendar year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our future results of operations and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the balance sheet  the recognition in other comprehensive income of gains or losses and prior service costs or credits arising during the period  but which are not included as components of periodic benefit cost  the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date  and disclosure of additional information about the effects on periodic benefit cost for the following fiscal year arising from delayed recognition in the current period 
in addition  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to include guidance regarding selection of assumed discount rates for use in measuring the benefit obligation 
effective december   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
and the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   allowing a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of january for errors that were not previously deemed material  but are material under the guidance in sab we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements

related person transactions we have engaged in transactions with some of our directors or employees  and other related persons 
see note  related person transactions  to our consolidated financial statements and item of part iii 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into any financial instruments for trading purposes 
however  the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within our series a convertible preferred stock creates a market risk exposure resulting from changes in the price of our common stock 
these embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on the price and volatility of our common stock  however  we do not expect significant changes in the near term in the one year historical volatility of our common stock used to calculate the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates results from the variable rate of our credit agreement with capitalsource 
an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflow and lower borrowing capacity 
the interest rate on our senior secured revolving credit facility is payable at variable rates indexed to either libor or the base rate 
the effect of each increase in the libor rate and the base rate on our senior secured revolving credit facility would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately million 
the revolving credit facility is currently due to be repaid by november  based on repayment on that date and based on the us yield curve as of december  and other available information  we project interest expense on our variable rate debt to increase decrease approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have operations overseas 
generally  all significant activities of the overseas affiliates are recorded in their functional currency  which is generally the currency of the country of domicile of the affiliate 
the foreign functional currencies with which we deal are netherlands antilles guilders  eastern caribbean units  bahamian dollars and euros 
the first three are pegged to the us dollar and have remained fixed for many years 
management does not believe a change in the euro exchange rate will materially affect our financial position or results of operations
