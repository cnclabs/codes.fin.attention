item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview prior to acquiring symphony health services  llc during we operated in the following three business segments  which were managed separately based on fundamental differences in operations program management services  freestanding hospitals and healthcare management consulting 
program management services include hospital rehabilitation services including inpatient acute and subacute rehabilitation and outpatient therapy programs and contract therapy programs 
on july   we acquired symphony  which was a leading provider of contract therapy program management services 
symphony also operated a therapist and nurse staffing business and a healthcare management consulting business 
with the acquisition of symphony  we created a new segment other healthcare services  which includes our preexisting healthcare management consulting business together with symphony s staffing and consulting businesses 
we also previously operated a healthcare staffing segment prior to selling that business on february  year ended december  in thousands revenues program management contract therapy hospital rehabilitation services program management total freestanding hospitals other healthcare services healthcare staffing less intercompany revenues total operating earnings loss 

program management contract therapy hospital rehabilitation services program management total freestanding hospitals other healthcare services healthcare staffing unallocated asset impairment charge unallocated corporate expenses restructuring total intercompany revenues represent sales of services  at market rates  between our operating divisions 
the operating earnings of hospital rehabilitation services include a million impairment loss on certain separately identifiable intangible assets 
the operating loss for healthcare staffing includes a  gain realized on the sale of the business on february  represents an impairment charge associated with the abandonment of internally developed software that was never placed in service 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
represents certain expenses associated with our starmed staffing business  which was sold on february  sources of revenue in our program management segment  we derive the majority of our revenues from fees paid directly by healthcare providers rather than through payment or reimbursement by government or other third party payors 
a portion of our revenues in this segment are derived from our direct bill contract therapy rehab agencies 
our inpatient and outpatient therapy programs are typically provided through agreements with hospital clients with three to five year terms 
our contract therapy services are typically provided under one to two year agreements primarily with skilled nursing facilities 
in our freestanding hospital segment  we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees for patient care services  which are usually paid for or reimbursed by medicare and medicaid or third party managed care programs

revenues for the freestanding hospitals segment increased million from million in to million in revenues for hospital rehabilitation services decreased million in contract therapy 
contract therapy revenues increased million from million in to million in the majority of this revenue growth was due to the acquisition of symphony s rehabworks business  which contributed revenues of million in the six months following the acquisition 
we operated in rehabworks locations at december  the remaining revenue increase of million is primarily due to an increase in the average number of legacy contract therapy locations operated from in to in and a increase in the average revenue per minute of service in the legacy contract therapy locations 
same store revenues grew in which is down from the same store growth rate achieved in the prior year 
the decline in the rate of same store revenue growth is primarily due to the impact of part b therapy caps instituted on january   which had a significant impact on part b revenues throughout the first half of for the year  medicare part b revenues decreased million or for our legacy contract therapy business 
in addition  same store growth for was positively impacted by the phase in of the first stages of the rule  which caused certain patients to seek services in a skilled nursing setting rather than in an inpatient rehabilitation setting 
hospital rehabilitation services 
hospital rehabilitation services operating revenues for declined by million  or 
a small increase in revenue from the outpatient business only partially offset a decline in inpatient revenues 
in the outpatient business  same store revenues grew  due to a increase in same store units of service and a increase in net revenue per unit of service 
the decline in inpatient revenue reflects a decline in the average number of operating units from in to in and pricing pressure experienced on certain contract renewals 
the decline in average operating units was primarily in the subacute business  which has stabilized in recent months 
the inpatient business was further impacted by a decline in acute rehabilitation same store revenues which was primarily due to a decline in same store discharges 
the rule continues to impact our unit level census and caused a reduction in the number of discharges for as an increasing number of patients with diagnoses outside of the qualifying diagnoses are being treated at other patient care settings 
freestanding hospitals 
freestanding hospital segment revenues were million in compared to million in this division was formed with the acquisition of the assets of meadowbrook which was completed on august   therefore  only five months of meadowbrook s operating revenues are included in our financial statements for the four meadowbrook hospitals generated revenues of million in the remaining million of revenue in reflects the acquisitions of solara hospital of new orleans in june and memorial rehabilitation hospital in midland  texas in july and the openings of new freestanding rehabilitation hospitals in arlington  texas in december and amarillo  texas in october other healthcare services 
other healthcare services segment revenues were million in compared to million in a small decrease in revenue from our phase consulting business was more than offset by the revenues generated by symphony s therapist and nurse staffing and skilled nursing consulting services businesses  which were acquired on july  cost and expenses of of revenue revenue dollars in thousands consolidated costs and expenses operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative impairment of assets restructuring depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses in  certain expenses associated with the indemnification of pre sale liabilities related to our former starmed staffing business  in excess of the amount accrued upon the sale of the business on february   have not been allocated against our current business segments operating profits 
see the following table for detail of costs and expenses by business segment 
operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues due to increased operating costs in contract therapy and hospital rehabilitation services as discussed in more detail below and due to the overall shift in revenue mix toward our contract therapy and freestanding hospital businesses  which tend to have lower operating margins than our hospital rehabilitation services business 
the decrease in division selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues reflects the additional revenues from our new freestanding hospital business which requires less investment in division level selling and administrative personnel than our other divisions  lower division selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the symphony businesses and stable division selling  general and administrative costs in our other businesses 
while corporate selling  general and administrative expense remained flat as a percentage of sales  expense dollars increased primarily as a result of the july  acquisition of symphony  higher legal expenses primarily for defense costs in two matters that have been favorably resolved and the recognition of approximately million of stock based compensation expense in corporate selling  general and administrative expenses include million of costs related to symphony s corporate office in baltimore  maryland and approximately million of incremental expenses added to our corporate offices in st 
louis to support the symphony businesses 
the majority of the million of costs relates to salaries and benefits for back office employees of the symphony businesses we acquired on july  between july and december   we reduced the net headcount for symphony s back office by employees 
we anticipate a total net headcount reduction of approximately by the time all back office integration activities are completed by late during the last six months of  we achieved annualized cost savings in combined back office costs of approximately million 
the rate of synergy savings has progressively increased as back office activities have become fully integrated and positions in symphony s corporate offices have been eliminated 
exiting the fourth quarter of  the annualized run rate of back office synergy savings was approximately million 
we anticipate achieving total cost savings  once all back office activities are fully integrated  of approximately million  inclusive of margin improvements expected from the implementation of our point of service technology 
depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of the acquisitions of symphony  solara hospital of new orleans and memorial rehabilitation hospital in midland

total contract therapy costs and expenses increased in compared to primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses associated with symphony s rehabworks business  which was acquired on july  rehabworks accounts for the vast majority of the million increase in the division s direct operating expenses 
in addition  direct operating expenses for the legacy contract therapy locations increased in reflecting an increase in the average number of legacy contract therapy locations and an increase in the total labor and benefit cost per minute of therapy service 
this increase is attributable to higher wage costs  greater use of higher cost contract labor and lower therapist productivity partially attributable to the negative impact of the part b therapy caps during the first half of additionally  labor and benefit cost per minute of service is higher in the recently acquired rehabworks locations when compared to the legacy contract therapy locations 
contract therapy s corporate selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue from to primarily as a result of overhead costs incurred for symphony s corporate office in baltimore 
in addition  corporate selling  general and administrative expenses for include allocated stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of symphony 
as a result of these factors  operating earnings for contract therapy decreased from million in to million in hospital rehabilitation services 
total hospital rehabilitation services hrs costs and expenses declined from to primarily due to a decline in direct operating expenses and the impact of an impairment charge in direct operating expenses declined as average units in operation fell from to hrs s direct operating expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue from to primarily as a result of higher labor and benefit costs resulting from continued wage pressure for therapists and pricing pressure experienced on certain contract renewals 
inpatient revenue per discharge increased while labor and benefit costs per discharge  including contract labor  increased compared to these cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in division bad debt expense resulting primarily from several recoveries of accounts previously turned over to attorneys for collection 
division level selling  general  and administrative expenses have declined  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  reflecting efforts to control costs and consolidate certain management functions with our contract therapy division 
these efforts were partially offset by an increased investment in program marketing directed at identifying more rule qualifying patients and improving overall patient census 
these efforts enabled us to mitigate the negative impact of the rule better than the industry as a whole 
measured on a same store basis  we experienced a year over year decline in acute rehabilitation discharges 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in reflecting efforts to control costs and greater leveraging of these expenses with the acquisition of symphony 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined the vitalcare trade name and contractual customer relationship intangible assets were impaired and wrote down the value of those assets by million 
hrs s depreciation and amortization expense declined from to primarily due to lower amortization associated with vitalcare s intangible assets 
the net effect of the revenue decline  lower operating margins  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  the prior year impairment charge and reduced depreciation and amortization expense in was a million increase in hrs operating earnings from million in to million in freestanding hospitals 
the freestanding hospitals segment  which was formed in the third quarter of with the acquisition of meadowbrook  generated operating earnings of million in compared to an operating loss of million in during  our freestanding hospitals segment incurred total start up costs of approximately million for our arlington  texas rehabilitation hospital  which admitted its first patient in late december  our newly constructed amarillo  texas facility  which admitted its first patient in october  and our midland  texas freestanding rehabilitation hospital  which was acquired on july  but did not receive its medicare and state certifications until early august 
we define start up costs as net operating losses incurred prior to approval of medicare licensure 
the segment s operating loss for was primarily due to the impact of lower than expected patient census and start up costs for our arlington  texas and amarillo  texas facilities 
other healthcare services 
operating earnings for the other healthcare services segment were million in compared to an operating loss of million in this improvement is primarily due to the acquisition of symphony s therapist staffing business on july  non operating items interest income decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to the impact of lower average cash and investment balances 
interest expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to the increase in borrowings against our revolving credit facility resulting primarily from the funding requirements for the symphony  solara and midland acquisitions 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility was million 
we had no balance outstanding as of december  interest expense also includes interest on subordinated promissory notes issued as partial consideration for various acquisitions completed over the last three years  commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit  and fees paid on outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   the remaining aggregate principal balance on all subordinated promissory notes was approximately million 
earnings before income taxes  equity in net loss of affiliates and minority interests declined to million in from million in the provision for income taxes was million in compared to million in  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the decline in the effective tax rate in is principally the result of lower taxable income generated in certain high tax rate states  state tax net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of accruals for certain state tax exposures that were favorably resolved during the year or because the related statute of limitations lapsed 
equity in net loss of affiliates represents our share of the losses of less than majority owned equity investments  primarily our investment in intelistaf holdings 
during the first quarter of  we elected to abandon our interest in intelistaf and therefore wrote off the remaining carrying value of our investment in intelistaf of million 
this decision was made for a variety of business reasons including intelistaf s continuing poor operating performance  the disproportionate percentage of our management time and effort that was being devoted to this non core business  and an expected income tax benefit to be derived from the abandonment 
equity in net loss of affiliates for includes an overall loss of million related to our investment in intelistaf 
during  our share of intelistaf losses was million 
equity in net loss of affiliates for also included a million write down in the carrying value of our investment in intelistaf to reflect an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment 
diluted earnings loss per share was in compared to in twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues change dollars in thousands contract therapy hospital rehabilitation services freestanding hospitals n a other healthcare services healthcare staffing less intercompany revenues consolidated revenues the increase in consolidated operating revenues from to is primarily attributable to the growth in our contract therapy business resulting both from organic growth and targeted acquisitions and revenues from the new freestanding hospitals segment which was formed in august with the acquisition of substantially all of the operating assets of meadowbrook healthcare  inc contract therapy 
contract therapy revenues grew significantly in as compared to a portion of this revenue increase  million  is attributable to the acquisitions of cpr therapies in february and cornerstone rehabilitation in december in addition to the revenues from the acquisitions  continued success of the division s sales efforts and same store revenue growth of were driving forces behind the overall revenue growth 
however  much of the same store growth was attributable to overall increases in medicare part a patient services  which generate lower than average profit margins 
the average revenue per location increased year over year due primarily to the same store growth mentioned above  which was partially offset by the smaller average size of the program locations purchased in the acquisitions mentioned above 
hospital rehabilitation services 
hospital rehabilitation services operating revenues declined by million or in as a million decline in inpatient revenues was only partially offset by a million increase in outpatient revenues 
overall inpatient same store discharges fell  primarily due to the continued implementation of the rule 
inpatient same store revenues fell  as pricing pressures compounded the impact of the rule 
the average number of inpatient units managed in increased from fiscal year  however  new openings did not generate sufficient revenue to offset the impact of closing larger mature facilities 
in particular  revenue from units associated with the march  acquisition of vitalcare fell million in  primarily due to a significant number of contract terminations 
the average number of outpatient units managed in increased from higher revenues per unit of service offset a decline in the number of outpatient same store visits 
average outpatient revenue per location grew as units opened since the middle of have been generally larger than units closed over the same time period 
freestanding hospitals 
freestanding hospital revenues were million in our acquisition of the assets of meadowbrook was completed on august   therefore  only five months of meadowbrook s operating revenues are included in our financial statements for revenues for the period were negatively impacted by lower than expected patient census as efforts to reestablish referral networks and renegotiate key managed care contracts after the acquisition took longer than anticipated 
cost and expenses of of revenue revenue dollars in thousands consolidated costs and expenses operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative impairment of assets restructuring charge depreciation and amortization gain on sale of business total costs and expenses in  certain expenses associated with the indemnification of pre sale liabilities related to our former starmed staffing business  in excess of the amount accrued upon the sale of the business on february   have not been allocated against our current business segments operating profits 
see the following table for detail of costs and expenses by business segment 
operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues due to increased operating costs in contract therapy and hospital rehabilitation services as discussed in more detail below and due to the overall shift in mix to more contract therapy business  which tends to have lower operating margins 
the decrease in division selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues resulted primarily from the contract therapy division s higher revenues  which helped to leverage the division s overhead costs 
corporate selling  general and administrative costs declined as a percentage of revenues primarily due to efforts to control costs combined with a decrease in management incentive costs 
in connection with the sale of our starmed healthcare staffing business in february  we initiated a series of restructuring activities to reduce the cost of corporate overhead that had previously been absorbed by the staffing division 
these activities included the elimination of approximately positions  exiting a portion of leased office space at our corporate headquarters  and the write off of certain abandoned leasehold improvements associated with the office space consolidation 
in addition  we modified the term of the stock options of certain starmed employees to allow them additional time to exercise vested options 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million in of of unit unit revenue revenue dollars in thousands contract therapy operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses hospital rehabilitation services operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative impairment of assets depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses freestanding hospitals operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses healthcare staffing operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative gain on assets held for sale total costs and expenses other healthcare services operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses contract therapy 
total contract therapy costs and expenses increased in compared to primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses associated with the increased number of contract therapy locations being managed by the division 
in addition  the division s direct operating expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue from to primarily as a result of an increase in the division s mix of lower margin medicare part a revenues  substantial increases in contract therapy s cost of direct labor  which is being fueled by the continued tight therapist labor market  and the impact of communication and data costs 
these increased direct operating costs were partially offset by therapist productivity improvements as well as a reduction in contract therapy s bad debt expense  resulting from the positive outcomes of settlements reached on a few specific accounts 
contract therapy continues to leverage its selling  general and administrative costs  which decreased as a percentage of revenues from to while the cornerstone rehabilitation acquisition added new general and administrative fixed costs associated with its corporate office and related staff in louisiana  contract therapy s management has been able to keep its selling costs flat as well as continue leveraging its management structure  allowing them to operate more programs per manager  which has helped to reduce associated travel costs 
while remaining relatively flat as a percentage of operating revenues  contract therapy s depreciation and amortization expense increased from to primarily due to the amortization of certain intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of cpr therapies and cornerstone and the amortization of the division s proprietary information system 
the strong revenue growth and cost control at the corporate and division selling  general and administrative levels helped increase operating earnings from million in to million in hospital rehabilitation services 
total hospital rehabilitation services costs and expenses increased in compared to both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to an impairment loss associated with trade name and contractual customer relationships intangible assets acquired as part of the march acquisition of vitalcare and higher labor costs 
both the inpatient and outpatient businesses experienced increases in average wage rates and contract labor expense as the market for therapists remained tight 
the increase in the ratio of direct operating expenses to segment revenue reflects the higher labor costs and the termination of a number of higher margin contracts associated with the march  acquisition of vitalcare 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenues increased slightly as a result of an increase in depreciation due to outpatient expansion and a full year of amortization associated with the vitalcare acquisition 
the net effect of revenue decline  lower operating margins  the impairment charge and the increased depreciation and amortization during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was a million decline in hospital rehabilitation services operating earnings from million to million 
as discussed above  a number of contracts associated with the march acquisition of vitalcare were terminated in and this trend continued during the fourth quarter of  and operating losses were incurred for this business 
these events led us to assess whether the goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets associated with the vitalcare acquisition were impaired 
our conclusion  after performing all of the applicable impairment calculations and analyses  was that the vitalcare trade name and contractual customer relationship intangible assets were impaired 
as a result  we recorded a pretax impairment charge of million in the year ended december  freestanding hospitals 
the freestanding hospitals segment incurred an operating loss of million for the period from august  to december  primarily due to the impact of the lower than expected patient census  significant market analysis and promotional costs and start up costs associated with our arlington  texas facility which admitted its first patient in december and our amarillo  texas facility which admitted its first patient in october non operating items interest income increased from million in to million in  primarily due to the effect of higher interest rates 
interest expense  which remained flat from to  primarily includes interest on subordinated promissory notes issued as partial consideration for the meadowbrook acquisition in august and various other acquisitions completed in  commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit and fees paid on outstanding letters of credit 
we had no outstanding balance against our line of credit as of december  and december  earnings before income taxes  equity in net loss of affiliates and minority interests decreased from million in to million in the provision for income taxes was million in compared to million in  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the effective tax rate decrease is primarily the result of the impact of non deductible goodwill associated with the sale of the staffing division on the effective rate 
equity in net loss of affiliates represents our share of the losses of less than majority owned equity investments  primarily our investment in intelistaf holdings 
equity in net loss of affiliates for includes an overall loss of million related to our investment in intelistaf 
during  our share of intelistaf losses was million 
intelistaf s results were negatively impacted by a million pre tax goodwill impairment charge  a valuation allowance against their deferred tax assets  a decline in revenue  margin contraction in the travel business due to higher housing and other living costs  and costs related to an operational restructuring and a debt re financing completed during equity in net loss of affiliates for also included a million write down in the carrying value of our investment in intelistaf to reflect an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment 
diluted earnings loss per share was in compared to in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  and a current ratio  the amount of current assets divided by current liabilities  of to working capital increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  this increase was primarily due to the addition of working capital from the symphony acquisition on july  which was funded via long term borrowings against our revolving credit facility 
net accounts receivable were million at december   compared to million at december  this increase is also primarily the result of the acquisition of symphony effective july  the number of days average net revenue in net receivables was and at december  and december   respectively 
this increase is primarily due to more days of average net revenue in contract therapy receivables and the greater mix of contract therapy receivables  including balances added via the acquisition of symphony  which tend to have a longer collection cycle 
the company has historically financed its operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under credit facilities and long term debt instruments 
we believe our cash on hand  cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our future working capital  capital expenditures  internal and external business expansion and debt service requirements 
we have a million  five year revolving credit facility  dated june   with million outstanding as of december  at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the revolving credit facility is expandable to million  subject to the approval of the lending group and subject to our continued compliance with the terms of the credit agreement 
as of december   we had approximately million in letters of credit issued to insurance carriers as collateral for reimbursement of claims 
the letters of credit reduce the amount we may borrow under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   after consideration of the effects of restrictive covenants  the available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was approximately million 
as part of the purchases of solara hospital of new orleans on june   the meadowbrook business in and other acquisitions completed in  we issued long term subordinated promissory notes to the respective selling parties 
these notes bear interest at rates ranging from 
as of december   approximately million of these notes remained outstanding 
approximately million is due within the next twelve months  with the remainder payable in installments through august in addition  as part of our arrangement with signature healthcare foundation  we extended a million line of credit to signature 
at december   signature had drawn approximately million against this line of credit 
in connection with the development and implementation of additional programs  including developing joint venture relationships  we may incur capital expenditures for acquisitions of property  renovations  equipment and deferred costs to begin operations 
in addition  we expect to invest significantly in our information technology systems to drive automation and efficiencies in our operating processes 
during  we expended approximately million for capital expenditures for equipment  facility build outs and information systems 
we also expect to expend capital to implement our acquisition strategy 
during  we expended approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of new businesses 
these funds were primarily derived from our line of credit 
we believe existing cash balances  internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
inflation although inflation has abated during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services continued to exceed the rate experienced by the economy as a whole 
our management contracts typically provide for an annual increase in the fees paid to us by our clients based on increases in various inflation indices 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporated herein by reference 
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments  exclusive of interest  as of december  in thousands less than more than total year years years years other operating leases purchase obligations long term debt other long term liabilities total we lease many of our facilities under non cancelable operating leases in the normal course of business 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
information relative to interest requirements is contained in note  long term debt  to our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain employees 
under the plan  participants may defer up to of their salary and cash incentive compensation 
the amounts are held in trust in designated investments and remain our property until distribution 
because most distributions of funds are tied to the termination of employment or retirement of participants  we are not able to predict the timing of payments against this obligation 
at december   we owned trust assets with a value approximately equal to the total amount of this obligation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed and will continue to discuss its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimating contractual allowances  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets and establishing accruals for known and incurred but not reported health  workers compensation and professional liability claims 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectability of specific accounts  historical experience and the aging of the accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze customers with historical poor payment history and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and make adjustments in the periods any excess or shortfall is identified 
contractual allowances 
our freestanding hospitals and contract therapy direct billing agencies recognize net patient revenues in the reporting period in which the services are performed based on our current billing rates  less actual adjustments and estimated discounts for contractual allowances 
these allowances are principally required for patients covered by medicare  medicaid  managed care health plans and other third party payors 
laws governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
in estimating the discounts for contractual allowances  we reduce our gross patient receivables to the estimated amount that will be recovered for the service rendered based upon previously agreed to rates with the payor 
these estimates are regularly reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known changes to contract terms  laws and regulations and payment history 
if such information indicates that our allowances are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional allowances as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised 
due to complexities involved in determining the amounts ultimately due from the payor  the amount we receive as reimbursement for healthcare services provided may be different than our estimates  and such differences could be significant 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets  both tangible and intangible  based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  is recorded as goodwill 
under statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
if the impairment test indicates that the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss should be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in an amount equal to the excess carrying value 
in  no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives was identified  however  in  we recognized an impairment loss of million to reduce the carrying value of the trade name we acquired in the march  acquisition of the common stock of american vitalcare  inc and its sister company  managed alternative care  inc collectively vitalcare 
we also determined that this intangible asset no longer had an indefinite life  and in  we began amortizing it on a straight line basis over the trade name s remaining estimated useful life 
as required by statement no 
 we also conducted an annual impairment assessment of goodwill related to our hospital rehabilitation services  contract therapy  freestanding hospitals and other healthcare services businesses and determined that the related goodwill was not impaired 
the test required comparison of the estimated fair value of these businesses to our book value 
the estimated fair value was based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as economic trends and government regulations  and internal factors such as changes in our forecasts or in our business strategies 
we believe the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are reasonable and appropriate  however  different assumptions and estimates could affect the results of our impairment analysis and in turn result in an impairment charge 
if an impairment loss should occur in the future  it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
at december   unamortized goodwill related to our contract therapy  hospital rehabilitation services  freestanding hospitals and other healthcare services businesses was million  million  million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
under statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  an asset group should be tested for recoverability and possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
primarily due to a loss of customer contracts at a rate more rapid than expected  the assets of vitalcare generated operating losses in and our projections demonstrated potential continuing losses associated with this asset group 
as a result  we determined that the carrying amount of the vitalcare asset group at december  was not recoverable because it exceeded the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
in  we recognized an impairment loss of million on contractual customer relationships  which is equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the vitalcare asset group exceeded its fair value 
statement no 
also addresses the accounting for the impairment or disposal of individual long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in  we decided to abandon an internal software development project we began in we had intended for this software application to be the building block of an integrated platform to support our strategy of clinically integrated post acute continuums of care 
because of cost overruns  this project was put on hold in with the intention of restarting the project at a later date 
following the hiring of a new chief information officer in the fourth quarter of  we completed a review of our information technology applications and concluded that this project would not meet the needs of the business and any additional costs necessary to make the application functional would be in excess of the anticipated benefit to be derived 
as a result of the decision to abandon this project  we recognized an impairment loss of million in to write off the entire carrying value of the previously capitalized software development costs 
health  workers compensation  and professional liability insurance accruals 
we maintain an accrual for our health  workers compensation and professional liability claim costs that are partially self insured and are classified in accrued salaries and wages health insurance and accrued expenses workers compensation and professional liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the combined amount of these accruals was approximately million 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation  and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
in analyzing the accruals  we also consider the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are appropriate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary

during  intelistaf incurred significant operating losses even though the healthcare staffing industry as a whole showed signs of recovery 
the company reviewed its investment in intelistaf for impairment in accordance with requirements of apb opinion no 
based on this review  the company concluded that an other than temporary decline in the value of the company s investment had occurred in the fourth quarter of this impairment combined with the company s share of intelistaf s operating losses reduced the carrying value of the company s investment in intelistaf to million at december  on march   we elected to abandon our interest in intelistaf 
this decision was made for a variety of business reasons including intelistaf s continuing poor operating performance  intelistaf s liquidity problems  the disproportionate share of rehabcare management time and effort that has been devoted to this non core business and an expected income tax benefit to be derived from the abandonment
