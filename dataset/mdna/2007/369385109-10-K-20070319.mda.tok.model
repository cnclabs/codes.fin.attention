item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the following discussion  general communication  inc and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are referred to as we  us and our 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to unbilled revenues  cost of goods sold exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense cost of goods sold accruals  allowance for doubtful accounts  share based compensation expense  depreciation  amortization and accretion periods  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see also our cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in item of this form k 
general overview through our focus on long term results  acquisitions  and strategic capital investments  we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins 
we have historically met our cash needs for operations  regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities 
historically  cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities 
as of january  we were reorganized under consumer  network access  commercial and managed broadband reportable segments  replacing the long distance  cable  local access and internet services reportable segments 
the realignment along customer lines rather than product lines allows us to more efficiently meet the demands of technological and product convergence 
segment and all other category data for the years ended december  and have been reclassified to reflect the organizational changes for comparability purposes 
a combination of specific identification and general allocations were employed to reclassify and amounts 
allocated amounts were generally determined using segment revenue or customer counts derived from first quarter of segment data 
we believe the first quarter of division of revenue and customers by segment is representative of the years ended december  and customer composition for purposes of reclassifying and revenue and cost of goods sold balances 
the network access segment provides services to other common carrier customers and the managed broadband segment provides services to rural school districts and rural hospitals and health clinics 
following are our segments and the services and products each offers to its customers reportable segments services and products consumer network access commercial managed broadband voice long distance x x x local access x x x directories x video x x data internet x x x x private line and private networks x x x managed services x x managed broadband services x wireless x x an overview of our services and products follows 
voice services and products long distance we generate long distance services revenues from monthly plan fees and usage charges 
factors that have the greatest impact on year to year changes in long distance services revenues include the rate per minute charged to customers and usage volumes expressed as minutes of use 
common carrier traffic routed to us for termination in alaska is largely dependent on traffic routed to our common carrier customers by their customers 
pricing pressures  new program offerings  and market and business consolidations continue to evolve in the markets served by our other common carrier customers 
if  as a result  their traffic is reduced  or if their competitors costs to terminate or originate traffic in alaska are reduced  our traffic will also likely be reduced  and our pricing may be reduced to respond to competitive pressures  consistent with federal law 
additionally  disruption in the economy resulting from terrorist attacks and other attacks or acts of war could affect our carrier customers 
we are unable to predict the effect on us of such changes 
however  given the materiality of other common carrier revenues to us  a significant reduction in traffic or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
due in large part to the favorable synergistic effects of our bundling strategy focused on consumer and commercial customers  long distance services continues to be a significant contributor to our overall performance  although the migration of traffic from our voice products to our data and wireless products continues 
our long distance service faces significant competition from acs  alascom  long distance resellers  and other local telephone companies that have entered the long distance market 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing long distance services and bundling different business segment services will continue to allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
local access we generate local access services revenues from four primary sources basic dial tone services  private line and special access services  origination and termination of long distance calls for other common carriers  and features and other charges  including voice mail  caller id  distinctive ring  inside wiring and subscriber line charges 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in local access services revenues include the average number of subscribers to our services during a given reporting period  the average monthly rates charged for non traffic sensitive services  the number and type of additional premium features selected  the traffic sensitive access rates charged to carriers and the universal service program 
we estimate that our december   and total lines in service represent a statewide market share of approximately  and  respectively 
at december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our lines are provided on our own facilities and leased local loops 
at december   and approximately of our lines are provided using the une platform delivery method 
our local access service faces significant competition in anchorage  fairbanks  and juneau from acs  which is the largest ilec in alaska  and from alascom in anchorage for consumer services 
alascom has received certification from the rca to provide local access services in fairbanks and juneau 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing local access services and bundling different services will allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
on september   february  and july   the rca issued orders granting us certification to serve the service areas of kpu  cordova telephone cooperative  cvtc  mta  the glacier state area served by acs of the northland  alaska telephone company  interior telephone company  united kuc and mukluk telephone company 
the affected rural local exchange carriers have appealed various aspects of the certification rulings 
we plan to offer service in these new areas using a combination of methods 
to a large extent  we plan to use our existing cable network to deliver local services 
where we do not have cable plant  we may use wireless technologies and resale of other carrier s services 
we may lease portions of an existing carrier s network or seek wholesale discounts  but our application is not dependent upon access to either unes of the ilec network or wholesale discount rates for resale of ilec services 
by letter submitted to the rca on january   we made a bona fide request for interconnection for the purposes of local access competition with mta  under the provisions of the telecom act 
we submitted this request to mta on the grounds that it waived its rural exemption under the terms of section f c when it launched its new video service through its wholly owned subsidiary mta vision  inc in competition with our cable television service 
mta  however  refused to comply with the negotiation and arbitration provisions under the telecom act claiming that it still retained a rural exemption 
we filed a complaint with the rca to resolve this dispute  and the rca conducted a public hearing on the matter on october  on february   the rca ruled that mta s rural exemption for the areas served by mta vision  inc had been lifted and that we may negotiate and arbitrate interconnection with mta 
negotiations ensued  and mta filed a petition for suspension and modification of its obligations to provide access to unes 
the petition did not affect mta s obligation to provide resale at wholesale rates under section c 
on december  the rca granted mta s petition for a three year period and arbitration as to mta s remaining obligations recommenced 
we have appealed the rca s suspension and modification decision 
following negotiation and arbitration  an arbitrated interconnection agreement was filed for approval on january  such approval was granted on february  we intend to commence local service entry into eagle river and the mat su valley during on may   we tendered an interconnection request to the city of ketchikan d b a kpu  which had been authorized by the rca to provide video programming services through its kpu commvision division on april  under the terms of section f c of the telecom act kpu s rural exemption from negotiation will be forfeited if  and when  kpu commences offering video programming 
on june   we entered into a stipulation with kpu recognizing that kpu would forfeit its rural exemption and that negotiations for interconnection would commence when kpu commenced offering video programming 
kpu began offering video programming and negotiations began in december and culminated in a contract in june the ketchikan city council approved the contract in june and the contract was submitted to the rca for final approval on august  we received an order from the rca on november  approving the interconnection agreement 
we intend to commence local service entry into ketchikan during on may   we tendered an interconnection request to cvtc 
based on our request  the rca opened an inquiry for the purpose of determining whether or not to terminate the rural exemption of cvtc 
in july we entered into a settlement with cvtc under which interconnection negotiations would take place  followed by private arbitration if necessary  under sections a and b of the telecom act 
on july   we filed a formal notice of withdrawal of the rural exemption inquiry 
negotiations and arbitration for an interconnection agreement with cvtc are on going 
we plan to have deployed more than  dlps lines which utilize our anchorage coaxial cable facilities by december  this service delivery method allows us to utilize our own cable facilities to provide local access service to our customers and avoid paying local loop charges to the ilec 
directories we sell advertising in our yellow pages directories to commercial customers and distribute white and yellow pages directories to customers in certain markets we serve 
we also sell on line directory products 
video services and products we generate cable services revenues from three primary sources digital and analog programming services  including monthly basic and premium subscriptions  pay per view movies and one time events  such as sporting events  equipment rentals  and advertising sales 
our cable systems serve communities and areas in alaska  including the state s five largest population centers  anchorage  fairbanks  the matanuska susitna valley  the kenai peninsula  and juneau 
the primary factors that contribute to period to period changes in cable services revenues include average monthly subscription rates and pay per view buys  the mix among basic  premium and digital tier services  the average number of cable television subscribers during a given reporting period  set top box utilization and related rates  revenues generated from new product offerings  and sales of cable advertising services 
we increased rates charged for certain cable services in eleven communities  including four of the state s five largest population centers  anchorage  fairbanks  the matanuska susitna valley  and the kenai peninsula 
the rate increases were primarily effective in january and increased approximately for those customers who experienced an adjustment 
in the fourth quarter of we increased rates charged for certain cable services in seven communities  including the state s five largest population centers 
the rates increased approximately for those customers who experienced an adjustment 
data services and products internet we generate internet services revenues from three primary sources access product services  including cable modem  dial up  and dedicated access  network management services  and wholesale access for other common carriers 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in internet services revenues include the average number of subscribers to our services during a given reporting period  the average monthly subscription rates  the amount of bandwidth purchased by large commercial customers  and the number and type of additional premium features selected 
marketing campaigns continue to be deployed featuring bundled products 
our internet offerings are bundled with various combinations of our long distance  cable  and local access services and provide free or discounted basic or premium internet services 
value added premium internet features are available for additional charges 
we compete with a number of internet service providers in our markets 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing internet services allows us to be competitive in providing those services 
private line and private networks we generate private line and private network services revenue from two primary sources leasing capacity on our facilities that utilize voice and data transmission circuits  dedicated to particular subscribers  which link a device in one location to another in a different location and through the sale of ip based data services on a secured shared network to businesses linking multiple enterprise locations 
the factor that has the greatest impact on year to year changes in private line and private network services revenues is the number of private lines and private networks in use 
we compete against alascom  acs and other local telecommunication service providers 
managed services we design  sell  install  service and operate  on behalf of certain customers  communications and computer networking equipment and provide field depot  third party  technical support  communications consulting and outsourcing services 
we also supply integrated voice and data communications systems incorporating interstate and intrastate digital private lines  point to point and multipoint private network and small earth station services 
there are a number of competing companies in alaska that actively sell and maintain data and voice communications systems 
our ability to integrate communications networks and data communications equipment has allowed us to maintain our market position based on value added support services rather than price competition 
these services are blended with other transport products into unique customer solutions  including managed services and outsourcing 
managed broadband services we generate managed broadband services revenue through our schoolaccess  connectmd and managed video conferencing products 
our customers may purchase end to end broadband services solutions blended with other transport and software products 
there are several competing companies in alaska that actively sell broadband services 
our ability to provide end to end broadband services solutions has allowed us to maintain our market position based on value added products and services rather than solely based on price competition

we offer wireless services by reselling dobson services 
we provide limited wireless local access and internet services using our own facilities 
we compete against dobson  acs  alaska digitel  and resellers of those services in anchorage and other markets 
we have   and  combined consumer segment and commercial segment wireless lines in service at december   and  respectively 
a wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device 
our average wireless revenue per combined consumer and commercial subscriber is  and during the years ended december   and  respectively  calculated by dividing our combined consumer and commercial segments usage revenues by our combined consumer and commercial segments subscriber count 
on january  we invested million in alaska digitel in exchange for an equity interest 
we do not have voting control of alaska digitel 
we view our investment as an incremental way to participate in future growth of the wireless industry in alaska 
our existing distribution agreement with dobson remains in full effect and our existing wireless products will continue to compete with alaska digitel in the alaska market

the increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to increased wireless subscribers 
consumer segment cost of goods sold consumer segment cost of goods sold increased to million from to primarily due to increased wireless cost of goods sold resulting from increased revenue and increased video cost of goods sold 
the increased video cost of goods sold is primarily due to the expiration of arrangements with suppliers from which we earned rebates and refunds upon us meeting specified goals  increased channels offered to our subscribers  and increased subscribers 
the increase in cost of goods sold is partially off set by decreased voice cost of goods sold primarily due to the following cost savings resulting from the increased deployment of dlps lines during the year ended december   decreased voice minutes carried  and reduced access costs resulting from the distribution and termination of our traffic on our own local access services network instead of paying other carriers to distribute and terminate our traffic 
the statewide average cost savings is approximately and per minute for originating and terminating interstate and intrastate traffic  respectively

we leased a portion of our mile fiber optic system capacity that extends from prudhoe bay to valdez via fairbanks  and provide management and maintenance services for this capacity to a significant customer 
the lessee signed a contract with a competitor in march  started the transition of their circuits from our fiber optic cable system to our competitor s microwave system in june  and expects to complete the transition during the second quarter of in november  we signed an agreement with our competitor to lease capacity on our fiber optic cable system and provide certain other services to them in association with their contract 
we expect this transition to result in a million annual decrease in the data component of commercial segment revenue when it is completed 
commercial segment revenues the decrease in voice revenue is primarily due to decreased minutes carried for our commercial segment customers 
the increase in video revenue is primarily due to a or million increase in political advertising sales for the alaska state wide and local elections

the slowdown was due to the september  conversion to our unified order management and fulfillment  billing  customer service  cash application  and credit and collection system 
our ability to perform our collections process timely was significantly restored by december   a million increase in certain promotion expenses in  and a  increase in fiber repair expenses in resulting from multiple breaks in our fiber optic cable that extends from prudhoe bay to valdez via fairbanks in october the selling  general and administrative expenses increase is partially off set by the following a million decrease in managed broadband segment s bad debt expense primarily due to increased allowances for certain managed broadband segment customers in for which payments were received in  a million decrease in labor costs in  a million decrease in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual in  and a million decrease in contract labor in primarily due to a reduced number of contractors supporting our information technology systems 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in  primarily due to the net increases described above without a proportional increase in revenues 
restructuring charge in august we committed to a reorganization plan to more efficiently meet the demands of technological and product convergence by realigning along customer lines rather than product lines 
the reorganization plan included integration of several functions resulting in the layoff of employees by november  during the year ended december  we recognized a restructuring charge of million for workforce reduction costs across all functions 
total costs incurred under this plan were million 
the following table sets forth the restructuring charges by segment during amounts in thousands consumer network access commer cial managed broadband total reportable segments restructuring charge incurred through the year ending december  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the increase is primarily due to our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in  and a  software impairment recognized in as discussed above 
other expense  net other expense  net of other income  decreased to million in primarily due to the following in august  we finalized a million amended senior credit facility to replace our may  senior credit facility resulting in the following expenses o we recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt in resulting from termination of our satellite transponder capital lease  and o we recognized million in amortization and write off of loan and senior notes fees in because a portion of the amended senior credit facility was a substantial modification of the may  senior credit facility 
senior credit facility deferred loan fee amortization expense decreased  or in after the august amendment  interest income increased million to million in resulting from the increased average cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances in  and interest expense decreased  due to construction period interest capitalization in income tax expense income tax expense totaled million in and our effective income tax rate increased from in to in primarily due to adjustments to deferred tax assets in at december   we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will begin expiring in if not utilized  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years 
we estimate that we will utilize net operating loss carryforwards of million to million during the year ended december  our utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards is subject to limitations pursuant to internal revenue code section we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that expire from to tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense

network access segment revenues the increase in voice revenue is primarily due to increased minutes carried for our other common carrier customers partially off set by a decrease in our average rate per minute on minutes carried for other common carriers 
the average rate per minute decrease is primarily due to a rate decrease mandated by federal law which will result in annual rate decreases of per year and a change in the composition of traffic carried resulting from one of our common carrier customer contracts 
network access segment cost of goods sold network access segment cost of goods sold decreased to million in voice cost of goods sold decreased to million in primarily due to receipt in of million upon the settlement of four separate claims with at t and alascom pursuant to a master agreement of which million reduced the network access segment voice cost of goods sold in the decrease is partially off set by increased voice cost of goods sold due to increased long distance minutes carried and receipt in of million from an intrastate access cost pool that previously overcharged us for access services of which  reduced the network access segment voice cost of goods sold in commercial segment overview commercial segment revenue represented of consolidated revenues

we had  commercial segment long distance accounts at december  a long distance account is defined as a customer account that is invoiced a monthly long distance plan fee or has made a long distance call during the month 
due to our implementation of a new unified billing system on september  this statistic is not available as of december  commercial segment revenues the decrease in voice revenue is primarily due to a decrease in minutes carried for our commercial segment customers 
the decrease in data revenue is primarily due to million earned in from an equipment sale and installation project and a million decrease in product sales revenue due to the sale of products to certain customers in that did not recur in the decrease is partially off set by the following a million or increase in managed services revenue primarily due to special project revenue earned in for services sold to two customers  and a million or increase in internet services revenue primarily due to increased cable modem subscribers 
additionally  in the commercial segment sold data services to the managed broadband segment and all of the revenue was eliminated from the commercial segment

in all of a certain revenue stream was retained by the managed broadband segment and the associated internal cost of goods sold purchased from the commercial segment was eliminated from the managed broadband segment 
in the managed broadband and commercial segments operated under a revenue sharing agreement that resulted in an allocation of revenue between the two segments 
after considering the effect of the external revenue allocation change described above  the revenue increase is primarily due to an increased number of schoolaccess customers partially off set by a decreased number of rural health customers 
managed broadband segment cost of goods sold managed broadband segment cost of goods sold increased  to million in we performed an analysis of circuit costs directly contributing to commercial segment s voice revenue and managed broadband segment s data revenues and  as a result  increased the allocation of cost of goods sold to the managed broadband segment data cost of goods sold by million in commercial segment s voice cost of goods sold was decreased an equal amount in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in primarily due to the following a million increase in labor and health insurance costs resulting from an increased number of employees during the majority of as compared to  a million increase in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual  allowances of million established for certain managed broadband customers  and a decrease to bad debt expense from million in to million in due to a decrease in the realization of a recovery received from mci following their emergence from bankruptcy protection 
the increase is partially off set by a million write off in of previously capitalized mobile wireless network costs upon finalization of a long term distribution agreement

the long distance  local access  cable  internet and wireless services industries continue to experience substantial competition  regulatory uncertainty  and continuing technological changes 
our future results of operations will be affected by our ability to react to changes in the competitive and regulatory environment and by our ability to fund and implement new or enhanced technologies 
we are unable to determine how competition  economic conditions  and regulatory and technological changes will affect our ability to obtain financing under acceptable terms and conditions 
our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents 
we believe  but can provide no assurances  that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  credit facilities  and other external financing and equity sources 
should cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities  capital expenditures will likely be reduced 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we will begin application of fin on january  and do not expect it to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under us generally accepted accounting principles 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
those policies considered to be critical accounting policies for the year ended december  are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the likelihood that our customers will satisfactorily comply with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the usac for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals  health clinics and school districts 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  financial health of specific customers  regional economic data  changes in our collections process  regulatory requirements  and our customers compliance with usac rules 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings  allowances may be reduced 
such allowance changes could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
impairment and useful lives of intangible assets we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets such as our cable certificates are not amortized but are subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment and quarterly evaluations of whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount as required by sfas no 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of the applicability of quoted market prices in active markets and  if quoted market prices are not available and or are not applicable  how the acquired asset will perform in the future using a discounted cash flow analysis 
estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures and technology  and changes in discount rates  performance compared to peers  material and ongoing negative economic trends  and specific industry or market sector conditions 
in determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying asset or similar assets in an effort to improve assumptions utilized in our estimates 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles  we may consider other information to validate the reasonableness of our valuations including third party assessments 
these evaluations could result in a change in useful lives in future periods and could result in write down of the value of intangible assets 
our cable certificate and goodwill assets are our only indefinite lived intangible assets and because of the significance of our cable certificate and goodwill assets to our consolidated balance sheet  our annual and quarterly impairment analyses and quarterly evaluations of remaining useful lives are critical 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in market conditions or other externalities  or recognition of previously unrecognized intangible assets for impairment testing purposes could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
accruals for unbilled costs we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates 
we estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services  and network changes that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers 
carriers that provide service to us regularly make network changes that can lead to new  revised or corrected billings 
such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
valuation allowance for net operating loss deferred tax assets our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that expire from to pre acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of december  based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies related to revenue recognition  share based payments  and financial instruments require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these and other matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
no specific conclusions reached by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  although outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
geographic concentration and the alaska economy we offer voice  data and wireless telecommunication services and video services to customers primarily throughout alaska 
because of this geographic concentration  growth of our business and of our operations depends upon economic conditions in alaska 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries  and in particular oil production  as well as investment earnings  tourism  government  and united states military spending 
any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us 
all of the federal funding and the majority of investment revenues are dedicated for specific purposes  leaving oil revenues as the primary source of general operating revenues 
in fiscal the state of alaska reported that oil revenues  federal funding and investment revenues supplied  and  respectively  of the state s total revenues 
in fiscal state economists forecast that alaska s oil revenues  federal funding and investment revenues will supply  and  respectively  of the state s total projected revenues 
the volume of oil transported by the transalaska oil pipeline system over the past years has been as high as million barrels per day in fiscal production has been declining over the last several years with an average of million barrels produced per day in fiscal the state forecasts the production rate to decline from million barrels produced per day in fiscal to million barrels produced per day in fiscal market prices for north slope oil averaged in fiscal and are forecasted to average in fiscal the closing price per barrel was on january  to the extent that actual oil prices vary materially from the state s projected prices  the state s projected revenues and deficits will change 
every change in the price per barrel of oil is forecasted to result in an increase of at least million in the state s fiscal revenue  when the price of oil exceeds per barrel a increase in the price per barrel is forecasted to increase revenue at least million 
the production policy of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its ability to continue to act in concert represents a key uncertainty in the state s revenue forecast 
the state of alaska maintains the constitutional budget reserve fund cbrf that is intended to fund budgetary shortfalls 
if the state s current projections are realized and no surpluses are deposited into the cbrf it will be depleted in the date the cbrf is depleted is highly influenced by the price of oil 
if the fund is depleted  aggressive state action will be necessary to increase revenues and reduce spending in order to balance the budget 
the governor of the state of alaska and the alaska legislature continue to evaluate cost cutting and revenue enhancing measures 
should new oil discoveries or developments not materialize or the price of oil become depressed  the long term trend of continued decline in oil production from the prudhoe bay area is inevitable with a corresponding adverse impact on the economy of the state  in general  and on demand for telecommunications and cable television services  and  therefore  on us  in particular 
periodically there are renewed efforts to allow exploration and development in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr 
the united states energy information agency has estimated that it could take nine years to begin oil field drilling after approval of anwr exploration 
no assurance can be given that the driving forces in the alaska economy  and in particular  oil production  will continue at appropriate levels to provide an environment for expanded economic activity 
no assurance can be given that oil companies doing business in alaska will be successful in discovering new fields or further developing existing fields which are economic to develop and produce oil with access to the pipeline or other means of transport to market 
we are not able to predict the effect of changes in the price and production volumes of north slope oil on alaska s economy or on us 
deployment of a natural gas pipeline from the state of alaska s north slope to the lower states has been proposed to supplement natural gas supplies 
a competing natural gas pipeline through canada has also been proposed 
the economic viability of a natural gas pipeline depends upon the price of and demand for natural gas 
either project could have a positive impact on the state of alaska s revenues and could provide a substantial stimulus to the alaska economy 
the governor of the state of alaska plans to introduce natural gas pipeline legislation on march  the legislation will outline project criteria that energy companies must meet in exchange for inducement incentives from the state of alaska to build a natural gas pipeline 
development of the ballistic missile defense system project has had a significant impact on alaskan telecommunication requirements 
the system is a fixed  land based  non nuclear missile defense system with a land and space based detection system capable of responding to limited strategic ballistic missile threats to the united states 
the system includes deployment of up to ground based interceptor silos and battle management command and control facilities at fort greely  alaska 
the united states army corps of engineers awarded a construction contract and construction of test bed facilities began in as of january a total of fourteen ground based missile interceptors have been placed in underground silos 
the missile defense agency is reported to expect to emplace seven additional interceptors through september and expects to have a total of forty interceptors in alaska by tourism  air cargo  and service sectors have helped offset the prevailing pattern of oil industry downsizing that has occurred during much of the last several years 
we have  since our entry into the telecommunication marketplace  aggressively marketed our services to seek a larger share of the available market 
the customer base in alaska is limited  however  with a population of approximately  people 
the state of alaska s population is distributed as follows are located in the municipality of anchorage  are located in the fairbanks north star borough  are located in the matanuska susitna borough  are located in the kenai peninsula borough  are located in the city and borough of juneau  and the remaining are located in other communities across the state of alaska 
seasonality revenue derived from our long distance services product in our network access segment have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction  commercial fishing  and oil and gas activities 
our long distance services product in our consumer and commercial segments and our other products in all our segments do not exhibit significant seasonality 
our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures  snow and short daylight hours 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
schedule of certain known contractual obligations the following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years amounts in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease commitments purchase obligations other total contractual obligations for long term debt included in the above table  we have included principal payments on our senior credit facility and senior notes 
interest on amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility is based on variable rates 
we used the current rate paid on the senior credit facility to estimate our future interest payments 
our senior notes require semi annual interest payments of million through february for a discussion of our senior notes and senior credit facility see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of our capital and operating leases  see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include a remaining commitment to purchase a certain number of outdoor  network powered multi media adapters and other vendor equipment of million and a remaining million commitment for our alaska airlines agreement as further described in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the contracts associated with these commitments are non cancelable 
purchase obligations also include open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling million which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets at december   because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at december  the open purchase orders are cancelable 
other consists of our commitment to acquire a substantial equity interest in alaska digitel for million and our million loan agreement with alaska digitel as further described above 
regulatory developments see part i item business regulation  franchise authorizations and tariffs for more information about regulatory developments affecting us 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
our senior credit facility carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at libor plus or less depending upon our total leverage ratio as defined 
should the libor rate change  our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
as of december   we have borrowed million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  each increase in the libor interest rate would result in  of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis
