item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
all references herein to the term fiscal year shall mean a year ended march of the year specified 
the company commenced operations in as a provider of telecommunications network transmission products that enable advanced telecommunications services over copper telephone wires 
until fiscal  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from its network service access nsa product lines  particularly the sale of network interface unit niu products and related products 
niu products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company introduced its first dsl products in fiscal and these products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
niu products and dsl products are the two major products within the company s telecom equipment business 
telecom equipment constituted approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has also provided audio teleconferencing services since fiscal  which constituted approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
westell realizes the majority of its revenues from the north american market 
the company is comprised of two segments telecommunications equipment manufacturer and teleconference services bureau 
the equipment manufacturing segment of the company s business consists of two product lines  offering a broad range of products that facilitate the broadband transmission of high speed digital and analog data between a telephone company s central office and end user customers 
these two product lines are customer networking equipment cne westell s family of broadband products enable the transport of high speed data and service over existing local telephone lines and the fiber network  allowing telecommunications companies to provide broadband services using their current copper and fiber infrastructure 
the company s broadband products also enable residential  small business and small office home office soho users to network multiple computers  telephones and other devices to access the internet 
digital subscriber lines dsl products currently make up the majority of the revenue in this product group 
network service access nsa westell s nsa product family consists of manageable and non manageable t transmission equipment for telephone services  along with an array of flexible t product mountings and new power distribution and remote monitoring products these products along with their associated cables and connectors serve as a point of demarcation between the telephone service and the end users equipment 
the t transmission equipment termed network interface units niu and the associated t mounting products make up the majority of revenue from this product group 
the company s teleconference service segment is comprised of a owned subsidiary  conference plus  inc conference plus provides audio  video  and web conferencing services 
businesses and individuals use these services to hold voice  video or web conferences with multiple participants 
conference plus sells its services directly to large customers  including fortune companies  and serves other customers indirectly through its private label reseller program 
the prices for the products within each market group vary based upon volume  customer specifications and other criteria and are subject to change due to competition among telecommunications manufacturers and service providers 
increasing competition  in terms of the number of entrants and their size  and increasing size of the company s customers because of past mergers  continues to exert downward pressure on prices for the company s products 
on november   sbc now at t inc acquired at t corp 
on december  at t  inc completed its acquisition of bellsouth 
in the fiscal year ended march   sales to at t inc generated approximately of the company s total revenues  in the equipment segment primarily nsa products excluding sales made to at t inc through minority business enterprises and for the services segment 
the largest customer of conference plus is at t inc at t offers services similar to conference plus 
the company is unable to predict at this time how the merger will impact the company s results of operations in the future 
the company s customer base is highly concentrated and comprised primarily of the regional bell operating companies rbocs  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant up front investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and invest in targeted sales and marketing efforts to launch new product lines 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities 
the company is focusing on expanding its product offerings in the equipment segment from basic high speed broadband to more sophisticated applications such as voip  in premise networking  wireless wireline convergence  ims ip multimedia subsystem and fmc fixed mobile convergence  video iptv and multifunctional broadband appliances 
this will require the company to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  which could adversely affect short term results of operations 
the company expects to increase spending in research and development and sales and marketing by approximately in fiscal year compared to fiscal year in an attempt to take advantage of these market opportunities 
in view of the company s current reliance on the dsl market for revenues and the unpredictability of orders and pricing pressures  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in the cne equipment manufacturing segment  the company is focusing on the evolving broadband demand  which includes increased bandwidth  richer application sets and converged capabilities 
the company has introduced products for both the existing local telephone and fiber network including the westell mediastations tm  ultraline  proline tm  versalink tm  and trilink tm  which are targeted at the home networking  small office home office soho and small business markets 
the company has multiple evaluations and is entering trials for trilink tm  trilink tm ims  ultraline series and the westell mediastation tm 
the company continues to focus on expanding existing and new products into the international market 
the company expects the overall nsa market to decline annually by approximately as the transition to high speed digital service continues 
this decline could impact the company s future revenue 
the company acquired of the common stock of hyperedge corporation  on december  with the goal of strengthening its position in the nsa market 
with the addition of hyperedge the company hopes to increase its market share in mountings and niu s 
the company acquired of the common stock of noran tel  inc on january  with the addition of noran tel  the company has obtained a canadian market channel for some of its existing products  has added additional transmission products and has gained new products in the areas of power distribution and remote monitoring 
the company also plans to invest in new product areas to compliment wireless and fiber applications 
critical accounting policies the company uses estimates and judgments in applying its accounting policies that have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following are the company s most critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable the company sells products primarily to various telecommunications providers and distributors 
sales to these customers have varying degrees of collection risk associated with them 
judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables based on aging  historical experience and customer s financial condition 
historically  we have not had significant losses due to the inability for the company to collect delinquent accounts 
however  bankruptcy by a significant customer would have a material impact on our results of operations 
inventory reserves the company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand  product lifecycle status and product development plans 
the company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reserve for obsolete and potential obsolete inventory 
the company also evaluates inventory valuation for lower of cost or market concerns 
prices related to future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values 
inventory purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into commitments for the purchase of inventory 
the commitments are at market rates and normally do not extend beyond one year 
should there be a dramatic decline in revenues the company may incur excess inventory and subsequent losses as a result of these commitments 
the company has established reserves for potential losses on such commitments 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company has significant deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from historically generated net operating losses 
a valuation allowance has been provided for a portion of these deferred tax assets that management believes it is more likely than not that will not be utilized 
the company assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets through an analysis of projected future taxable income in the jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets reside 
goodwill and intangibles accounting rules require that the company evaluate goodwill for impairment annually 
the company determined that it operates in two reporting units for the purpose of completing the impairment test of goodwill 
these reporting units are telecom equipment and telecom services 
the company utilizes third party appraisals of its telecom equipment and services reporting units fair values compared to book value to determine if there is a potential impairment 
the company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal these tests showed no impairment of goodwill 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews intangible assets and other long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under this new standard  companies no longer account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb instead  companies are required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense over the service period 
on april   the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of a rule that defers the required effective date of sfas r for registrants to the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  the company adopted this statement in the first quarter of its fiscal year using the modified prospective method 
the adoption of sfas r resulted in an additional pre tax expense of million in fiscal year

fiscal year gross margins were positively impacted by improvements in material costs 
the gross margin in the services segment decrease in fiscal year was due primarily to increased overhead costs related to credit card fees  maintenance and web outsourcing costs 
the company believes continued pricing pressures and continued reduction of nsa sales affecting its equipment segment could continue to adversely impact margins in the future 
it is the company s strategy to offset the effects of these anticipated price reductions with continued cost reductions  such as moving manufacturing offshore  and introducing new products that have higher sales prices and margins

 in thousands  except per share amounts revenue gross margin net income net income per common share basic diluted the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the company believes that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of the class a common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  write offs for obsolete inventory  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers  working capital deficits and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of one or a small number of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company generally ships products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on anticipated future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations and profitability 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents consisting primarily of the highest rated grade corporate commercial paper

the credit agreement  which has improved terms over the prior agreement  is a three year revolving credit facility in an amount up to million 
the obligations of the company under the credit agreement are secured by a guaranty from certain direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the company  and substantially all of the assets of the company 
any proceeds from the revolving loans would be used for working capital purposes  acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
the interest rate spread in the case of libor and base rate loans and the payment of the non use fees is dependent on the company s leverage ratio 
currently the revolving loans under the credit agreement bear interest  at the company s option  at the london interbank offered rate libor plus or an alternative base rate 
the alternative base rate is the greater of the lasalle bank national association prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the company is also required to pay a non use fee of per annum on the unused portion of the revolving loans 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants that include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum tangible net worth test  a total leverage ratio test consolidated total debt to ebitda  and a limitation on capital expenditures for any fiscal year 
other covenants include limitations on lines of business  additional indebtedness  liens and negative pledge agreements  incorporation of other debt covenants  guarantees  investments and advances  cancellation of indebtedness  restricted payments  modification of certain agreements and instruments  inconsistent agreements  leases  consolidations  mergers and acquisitions  sale of assets  subsidiary dividends  and transactions with affiliates 
the company was in compliance with these covenants on march  and expects to comply with these covenants for the term of the debt 
the company s operating activities generated cash of million  million and million in fiscal   and respectively

cash in excess of operating requirements  if any  will be invested on a short term basis primarily in the highest rated grade commercial paper 
the company believes cash on hand and generated from operations will satisfy its future cash requirements for the next twelve months 
future obligations and commitments as of march  consisted of the following payments due by fiscal year in thousands thereafter total debt and capital leases purchase obligations future minimum lease payments for operating leases future obligations and commitments purchase obligations consist of raw materials in the equipment segment and local and long distance telephone service commitments in the service segment that arise in the normal course of business operations 
the company had deferred tax assets of approximately million at march  the company has recorded a valuation allowance reserve of million to reduce the recorded net deferred tax asset to million 
the net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
the company uses estimates of future taxable income to access the valuation allowance required against deferred tax assets 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and will adjust the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets accordingly

the company does not currently use any derivative financial instruments relating to the risk associated with changes in interest rates
