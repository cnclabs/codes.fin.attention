our culture of quality  continuous improvement  superior innovation and a relentless focus on the fundamentals enables us to lead in the markets we serve 
we incorporated in minnesota in our disk drive components division is the world s leading supplier of suspension assemblies for disk drives 
suspension assemblies are precise electro mechanical components that hold a disk drive s read write head at microscopic distances above the drive s disks 
our innovative product solutions help customers improve yields  increase reliability and enhance disk drive performance  thereby increasing the value they derive from our products 
our biomeasurement division is focused on bringing new technologies and products to the market that provide information clinicians can use to improve the quality of health care 
late in calendar  we launched the inspectra tm sto system for perfusion status monitoring 
this noninvasive device provides a continuous  real time and direct measurement of tissue oxygen saturation sto  an indicator of perfusion status 
by helping clinicians instantly detect changes in a patient s perfusion status  the inspectra sto system enables clinicians to make better treatment decisions in critical care settings 
disk drive components division our disk drive components division manufactures suspension assemblies for all sizes and types of hard disk drives 
suspension assemblies are critical components of disk drives that hold the read write heads in position above the spinning magnetic disks 
we developed our leadership position in suspension assemblies through research  development and design activities coupled with substantial investment in process capabilities  product features and manufacturing capacity 
we manufacture our suspension assemblies with proprietary technology and processes with very low part to part variation 
these processes require manufacturing to precise specifications that are critical to maintaining the necessary microscopic clearance between the head and disk and the electrical connectivity between the head and the drive circuitry 
during  we shipped million suspension assemblies of all types  supplying nearly all domestic and foreign based manufacturers of disk drives and head gimbal assemblers 
we design our suspension assemblies with a focus on the increasing performance requirements of new disk drives  principally smaller read write heads  increased data density  improved head to disk stability during a physical shock event and reduced data access time 
increased capacity  improved reliability and performance  as well as the miniaturization of disk drives  generally require suspension assemblies with lower variability  specialized design  expanded functionality and greater precision 
we will continue to invest in advancing suspension assembly technology  enhancing our process capabilities and expanding our production capacity to maintain our market position 
we believe that end user demand for storage capacity will continue to increase as evolving consumer electronics and computing applications continue to require storage devices with increased capacity and functionality 
for calendar year  storage industry analysts are forecasting unit shipments of disk drives to increase by at least 
this growth in disk drive shipments will  in turn  continue to generate growth in demand for suspension assemblies 
we expect that our share in the desktop segment  the largest segment of the market  will continue to decline as certain programs for which we are a major supplier approach the end of their market lives 
we expect to counter this decline somewhat by further increasing our share in the faster growing mobile segment and continuing our strong leadership position in the enterprise segment 

table of contents products we categorize our current products as either suspension assemblies or other products  which consist primarily of etched and stamped component parts used in connection with  or related to  suspension assemblies 
the following table shows  for each of  and  the relative contribution to net sales  in millions of dollars and percentages  of each product category amount amount amount suspension assemblies other products total disk drive components division net sales see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item for financial information with respect to our business segments and a distribution of revenue and long lived assets by geographic area for each of  and see also eleven year selected financial data 
suspension assemblies 
during  we shipped million suspension assemblies  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
we shipped tsa suspensions produced using our subtractive manufacturing processes  which incorporate into the suspension the electrical connection from the read write head to the disk drive s electronic circuitry 
we also shipped conventional suspension assemblies  which do not provide the electrical connectivity features of a tsa suspension 
we have the capability to produce multiple variations of suspension assemblies 
this capability permits us to assist customers design efforts and meet the varied and changing requirements of specific customers 
we have developed significant proprietary capabilities in the design and production of suspension assemblies for both current and emerging disk drive designs  including advanced suspension assemblies developed in anticipation of new generations of higher performance disk drives and read write heads 
the continual pursuit of increased data density and lower storage costs is leading to suspension assemblies with finer electrical conductors and further adoption of value added features for suspension assemblies  such as clad unamount arms  plated grounds  electrostatic protection measures  formed and polished headlifts  a variety of limiter configurations  dampers  laminated loadbeams and dual stage actuation 
we also produce suspension assemblies that incorporate flexures  a component of a suspension assembly  using an additive manufacturing process to accommodate further electrical conductor miniaturization and the smaller next generation read write heads 
we call our suspension assemblies that incorporate flexures produced using our additive manufacturing process tsa suspension assemblies 
we are currently supporting tsa suspension program development activities for multiple customers next generation disk drive programs and continue to make progress on our additive processing capabilities as we prepare to bring our tsa operations to volume 
we do not expect to generate significant revenue from our tsa suspension assemblies during we are also purchasing some additive components to fill other existing customer development requirements 
other products 
to further assure customers that the suspensions they require for their products will be readily available when and where they are needed  we manufacture and sell to competitive suspension assembly manufacturers etched and stamped component parts  such as flexures and baseplates  for suspensions 
in  sales of component parts accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we anticipate component sales to be a reduced portion of our revenue in manufacturing our manufacturing strategy focuses on reliably producing suspension assemblies in high volume with the consistent precision and features required by our customers 
we have developed advanced proprietary process  inspection and measurement systems and controls  and related automated production equipment 
we have adopted an integrated manufacturing approach that closely couples design  tooling and manufacturing  which has facilitated the development  implementation and high volume production of new suspension assembly products 
we believe that our integrated approach and dedicated development capability give us a competitive advantage in quickly supplying suspension assembly prototypes and ramping volume manufacturing 

table of contents our integrated manufacturing approach also helps us to respond to short term shifts in market demand 
fluctuations in demand from quarter to quarter and an increasing number of customer programs in volume production require overall business agility 
we must operate efficiently over a wide range of peak volumes and product types  often producing a wider variety of suspension assemblies in lower volumes 
our products require several manufacturing processes  each dependent on different technical disciplines  to ensure the high degree of precision and the process control necessary to meet strict customer requirements 
we also have developed additive processing to produce flexures for future generations of suspension assemblies that meet the increasingly tighter performance specifications of our customers 
additive processing involves depositing thin metal layers onto a polyimide surface in the shape of the desired circuitry and then imaging and plating up metal layers to form the suspension s electrical conductors 
the manufacturing processes we employ include photoetching  stamping  chemical deburring  automated optical inspection  plasma etching  plating  precision forming  laser welding  metal deposition and ultrasonic cleaning 
our critical raw material needs are available through multiple sources of supply  with the following exceptions 
certain types of stainless steel  as well as covercoat and liquid photoresist liquid compounds used in our manufacturing process  are currently single sourced because the raw materials provided by these sources meet our strict specifications 
we have chosen to obtain certain other materials  such as gold salts and a laminate constructed from raw material that contains stainless steel  polyimide and copper  from a limited set of sources because of quality and pricing considerations 
to protect against the adverse effect of a short term supply disruption  we maintain several weeks supply of these materials 
our production processes require the storage  use and disposal of a variety of chemicals that are considered hazardous under applicable federal and state laws 
accordingly  we are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements for the handling of such materials 
we do not anticipate any material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position due to compliance with government regulations involving environmental matters 
research and development the disk drive industry is subject to rapid technological change  and our ability to remain competitive depends on  among other things  our ability to anticipate and respond to changes and to continue our close working relationships with the engineering staffs of our customers 
as a result  we have devoted and will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development efforts 
our research and development expenses for the disk drive components division were approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  we are classifying all of the costs of running our tsa suspension manufacturing lines as cost of goods sold  whereas we had previously classified a portion of these costs as research and development expense 
this change  along with cost reduction measures  will result in research and development expenses that will be approximately of net sales  down from in the transition to smaller disk drives  the development of smaller next generation read write heads  continuing improvement in data density and the increasing use of disk drives in consumer electronics applications necessitate the further miniaturization of suspension assemblies 
through continued investment in research and development  our existing processes for manufacturing tsa suspension assemblies are being extended to meet escalating customer requirements for precision and performance 
we have and will continue to implement alternative technologies  including additive processing to produce flexures for our tsa suspension assemblies that we believe will be required for manufacturing future generations of our products 
we are working with multiple customers developing tsa suspensions for their next generation disk drive programs 
we have completed installation of a volume tsa suspension production line  and we are preparing our tsa operations for higher volume 
we expect the transition to tsa suspensions to take place over the next five to seven years  with the pace of transition determined primarily by the pace at which disk drive makers introduce and ramp production of programs requiring additive processing 
as a result  we do not expect to generate significant revenue from this product during our research and development efforts also are directed at continuing to develop suspension assembly capability and features that enable our products to meet performance criteria desired by our customers for specific drive applications 
measurement  process development and process control are critical to improving capability related to static attitude  gram force  resonance and windage  all performance characteristics important to suspension assemblies 
our current suspension assembly features include clad unamount arms  plated grounds  electrostatic protection measures  formed and polished headlifts  a variety of limiter configurations  dampers  laminated loadbeams and dual stage actuation 

table of contents customers and marketing our disk drive products are sold principally through our account management team operating primarily from our headquarters in hutchinson  minnesota 
through subsidiaries  we have managers  technical representatives and quality coordinators in asia 
we sell our suspension assemblies to original equipment manufacturers for use in their products and to subassemblers who sell to original equipment manufacturers 
we also sell suspension assembly components to competitors 
our account management team is organized by individual customer  and contacts are typically initiated with both the customer s purchasing agents and its engineers 
our engineers and account management team together actively participate in the selling process and in maintaining customer relationships 
we have established vendor managed inventory  or vmi  facilities near the major production centers of certain individual customers to assure that we meet the customers inventory requirements 
certain agreements with our customers provide that we maintain minimum finished goods inventory levels 
during  approximately of our suspension assembly shipments were distributed to our customers in thailand  hong kong and the people s republic of china through our vmi facilities 
we also have established a service center in thailand that provides product logistics support  technical support and measurement services 
we are a supplier to nearly all domestic and foreign based manufacturers of disk drives and head gimbal assemblers 
the following table shows our five largest customers for as a percentage of net sales 
percentage of customer net sales sae magnetics  ltd 
tdk corporation seagate technology  llc western digital corporation alps electric co  ltd 
fujitsu sales to our five largest customers constituted  and of net sales for  and  respectively 
significant portions of our revenue may be indirectly attributable to large manufacturers of disk drives  such as samsung  toshiba and hitachi global storage technologies  which may purchase read write head assemblies from read write head manufacturers that utilize our suspension assemblies and suspension assembly components 
in september  tdk corporation acquired the recording head business of our customer alps electric co  ltd 
we expect to continue to depend upon a limited number of customers for our sales  given the relatively small number of disk drive manufacturers and head gimbal assemblers 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by reduced demand from our major customers 
backlog we generally make our sales pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term contracts 
our backlog of purchase orders was approximately  at september   as compared to  at september  our purchase orders may be changed or cancelled by customers on short notice 
in addition  we believe that it is a common practice for disk drive manufacturers to place orders in excess of their needs during growth periods 
accordingly  we do not believe that backlog should be considered indicative of sales for any future period 
seasonality the disk drive industry is increasingly experiencing seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year 
this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the winter holiday season 
in addition  corporate demand is higher during the second half of the calendar year when it budget calendars typically provide for more spending 
seasonal variability in demand for our suspension assemblies generally tracks that of the disk drive industry and may also be delayed or accelerated by existing inventory levels in the supply chain 
competition we believe that the principal factors of competition in the suspension assembly market include time to market  product performance and quality  design expertise  customer service  reliability of volume supply and price 
we believe that we are the leading supplier of suspension assemblies sold to manufacturers of disk drives and head gimbal assemblers 
our principal 
table of contents competitors for suspension assemblies are nihon hatsujo kabusikigaisha nhk  nat peripheral hk co  ltd  a joint venture of nhk and sae magnetics  ltd 
tdk corporation and magnecomp precision technology public company limited mpt 
in august  tdk corporation announced it had signed a purchase agreement to acquire mpt with an expected closing date by the end of calendar our principal competitors in producing suspension flexures are dae nippon corporation using subtractive processing and nitto denko corporation using additive processing 
although we cannot be sure that the number of competitors will not increase in the future or that users of suspension assemblies will not develop internal capabilities to manufacture suspension assemblies or suspension assembly components  we believe that the number of entities that have the technical capability and capacity for producing precision suspension assemblies or components in large volumes will remain small 
we continually monitor technological developments in and potential threats to the disk drive storage market and we believe disk drives will remain the primary data storage technology for the foreseeable future 
however  other types of data storage technology  such as solid state storage or flash semiconductor memory  holographic memory  tape memory and optical dvd and cd drives  may become competitive with certain disk drive applications  and thereby could affect the demand for our products 
as an example  emerging applications requiring digital storage  particularly in consumer electronics products that require lower storage capacity  may use flash memory instead of disk drives  which may limit growth opportunities for disk drive based data storage 
we believe that these technologies will not materially impact the market for disk drives in the near future 
biomeasurement division we established the biomeasurement division in with the objective of leveraging our culture of quality  engineering capabilities and leading edge measurement technology in the medical market 
we applied our engineering and manufacturing expertise to develop a device that noninvasively provides information about tissue perfusion  critical information needed in the resuscitation of trauma patients experiencing hemorrhagic shock 
our first device  the inspectra tissue spectrometer  was introduced in and was used primarily for research 
late in calendar  we launched a second generation product for clinical use  the inspectra sto system  which we are currently providing to key trauma centers for evaluation and selling to them for clinical use 
products we designed the inspectra sto system for use in the trauma and emergency medicine markets where there is a need to directly monitor the compromised tissue perfusion associated with hemorrhagic and other forms of shock 
the system consists of the inspectra sto tissue oxygenation monitor and the inspectra sto sensor  which are connected by a short length of optical cable 
the inspectra sto system has received us food and drug administration fda k clearance and ce mark registration in the european union 
the device provides an absolute measure of local tissue oxygen saturation sto  which quantifies the ratio of oxygenated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin in the microcirculation of skeletal or peripheral muscle 
this measurement helps clinicians instantly assess and detect changes in the patient s overall perfusion status  enabling them to make better treatment decisions in critical care settings 
the inspectra sto system uses near infrared spectroscopy to noninvasively provide a continuous  real time and direct measurement of sto in muscle tissue 
the inspectra sto tissue oxygenation monitor is configured for use with the single use sensor  which is applied to the thenar eminence the muscle at the base of the thumb on the palm side of the hand 
the thenar eminence has proven to be the most reliable site for obtaining tissue perfusion readings 
it provides consistent results among patients  with minimal influence from factors such as adipose tissue  edema and differences in tissue densities 
there are currently no other clinical methods for directly determining oxygen saturation in the microcirculation of tissue 
blood chemistry tests indirectly indicate tissue oxygenation levels  but the tests can be compromised by alcohol in the patient s bloodstream and also require blood samples  making them invasive and intermittent 
in contrast  the inspectra sto system noninvasively provides a direct  real time and continuous sto reading 
pulse oximeters give clinicians another indication of oxygenation  but spo  the measurement taken by pulse oximeters  represents the oxygen saturation of arterial blood and does not reflect how well oxygen is making its way into tissue 
the inspectra sto tissue oxygenation monitor measures local tissue oxygen saturation and not arterial blood oxygenation  its readings will vary as the supply and consumption of oxygen change at the measurement site 
transcutaneous po measures the partial pressure of oxygen in the skin and only permits an inference of 
table of contents whether tissue is being oxygenated based on what is being emitted by the skin 
our device measures oxygen saturation in the microcirculation of muscle tissue below the sensor to produce an accurate sto reading 
manufacturing we manufacture and assemble the inspectra sto tissue oxygenation monitor and the inspectra sto sensor in our hutchinson  minnesota manufacturing facility  using components and subassemblies obtained from outside suppliers 
our manufacturing process complies with the fda s quality system regulation 
we also comply with iso  an international quality systems standard for manufacturing processes  and our compliance with the iso standard is audited annually by a third party 
research and development we have conducted  and continue to conduct  clinical studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and value of our technology for patients who are in or may be about to go into shock  as well as for other clinical applications 
we also devote research and engineering resources to ongoing product development focused on addressing hemorrhagic shock and have conducted initial research into the potential application of near infrared spectroscopy to the monitoring of septic  cardiogenic and pulmonary shock  all of which involve insufficient tissue perfusion 
for  and  research and development expenses for the biomeasurement division were approximately   and  respectively 
we established a trauma and critical care advisory board in to ensure that the technology we develop addresses real and unanswered medical needs 
for the last several years  we have focused on trauma and hemorrhagic shock studies and have conducted a key multi site trial and several investigator initiated studies  most of which have been pilot studies 
in september we announced the results of the multi site sto trauma study we sponsored that was conducted by seven level i trauma centers that enrolled trauma patients 
it was initiated in to identify the role sto monitoring with our device could play in monitoring the inadequate tissue perfusion associated with hemorrhagic shock 
the study was designed to determine whether sto measurements on the thenar eminence are an indicator of hypoperfusion inadequate blood flow and oxygenation 
data from the study show that sto measured noninvasively on the thenar eminence is a statistically significant indicator of hypoperfusion in trauma patients and functions as well as base deficit and lactate measures  with the added benefits of being continuous  direct and noninvasive 
the results of the sto trauma study were published in the january journal of trauma 
our technology and product also may have potential clinical applications beyond the trauma and emergency medicine markets  but additional clinical research and product development may be required before we enter other markets 
marketing  sales and distribution we have focused our marketing efforts on preparing the trauma market to understand the value of sto in monitoring trauma patients and how the inspectra sto system works 
we have hired individuals with extensive experience in the areas of medical sales  marketing and clinical and regulatory affairs  and we have attended key trauma and critical care conferences  sponsored educational forums  produced newsletters and established key opinion leader relationships 
we estimate that the world wide trauma market for sto monitoring represents up to an million annual market in we expect our early customers to be large trauma centers in the united states and major medical centers in europe 
we then plan to expand our sales efforts to mid tier trauma centers in the united states and europe  as well as other departments of our existing customers 
we are selling our device using a direct sales force dedicated to the biomeasurement division 
we offer our customers a flexible technology acquisition program that will encourage a short term  no cost evaluation followed by an extended sensor purchase program or monitor rental period  as well as direct purchase opportunities 
we anticipate that many of our customers will use the product through our sensor purchase program prior to a direct purchase of the monitor 
competition the inspectra sto system is currently the only noninvasive tissue oxygenation monitor designed for the trauma and emergency medicine environments 
somanetics corporation and cas medical systems  inc produce devices that use near infrared spectroscopy to monitor levels of cerebral oxygen 
vioptix  inc produces a device that uses near infrared spectroscopy 
table of contents to monitor tissue oxygenation  but it is focused on plastic surgery applications 
somanetics corporation also has launched a product to monitor changes in regional blood oxygen saturation in both cerebral and somatic torso tissue 
in addition  other companies may have the ability to develop tissue perfusion monitors that use near infrared spectroscopy and that may in the future compete with the inspectra sto system 
it is possible that any of these companies  or others  may develop and market a product similar to the inspectra sto system for use in trauma or emergency medicine settings 
we also face competition from alternative clinical methodologies 
if trauma clinicians do not incorporate sto into their decision making and instead continue to rely on indirect indications of tissue perfusion provided by blood tests  in dwelling catheters and vital sign parameters  for instance  we may have difficulties selling our product 
general foreign sales sales to foreign based enterprises for both divisions totaled   and  for  and  respectively 
sales to foreign subsidiaries of us corporations totaled   and  for  and  respectively 
the majority of these sales were to the pacific rim region 
in addition  we have significant sales to us corporations which use our products in their offshore manufacturing sites 
intellectual properties we regard much of the equipment  processes  information and knowledge that we generate and use in the manufacture of our products as proprietary and protectable under applicable trade secret  copyright and unfair competition laws 
in addition  if we develop manufacturing equipment  products and processes for making disk drive products where patents might enhance our position  we have pursued  and we will continue to pursue  patents in the united states and in other countries covering our disk drive products 
we also have us and foreign patents issued and pending on the technology employed by the inspectra sto system 
as of september   we held us patents and foreign patents  and we had patent applications pending in the united states and patent applications pending in other countries covering both our disk drive components and our biomeasurement divisions 
internally  we protect intellectual property and trade secrets through physical security measures at our facilities  as well as through non disclosure and non competition agreements with all employees and confidentiality policies and non disclosure agreements with consultants  strategic suppliers and customers 
in the past  we have entered into licensing and cross licensing agreements under certain of our patents and patent applications allowing some of our disk drive competitors to produce products similar to ours in return for royalty payments and or cross license rights 
in november  we entered into cross license agreements with three suspension assembly suppliers  and in october  we entered into an additional cross licensing agreement with an additional suspension assembly supplier  enabling each of them to offer customers in the disk drive industry tsa suspension assemblies based on our proprietary technology 
the agreements also include cross licenses to certain existing and future suspension assembly technology 
from time to time  third parties in the disk drive industry have asserted patents against us or our customers that may relate to certain of our manufacturing equipment or products or to products that include our products as a component 
we also have litigated claims against a competitive supplier in the disk drive industry alleging infringement of our patents 
in addition  some of our disk drive industry customers have been sued on patents having claims closely related to products we sell 
we expect that  as the number of patents issued continues to increase  the volume of intellectual property claims could increase 
employees as of september   we had  employees 
the departure of a significant number of our specialized employees who cannot be replaced by comparable personnel would impair our ability to conduct our business 
the locations of our plants and the broad span and complexity of technology encompassed by our products and processes limit the number of qualified engineering and other candidates for key positions 
we expect that we will continue to use internal training for the development of key employees 
none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and we have experienced no related work stoppages 
we believe that our employee relations are good

item a 
risk factors disk drive components division almost all of our sales depend on the disk drive industry  which is cyclical  subject to ongoing technological innovation and subject to intense price competition 
sales of suspension assemblies and suspension assembly components accounted for of our net sales in  and the disk drive industry is intensely competitive and technology changes rapidly  such as during past industry transitions to smaller disks or higher density read write heads 
the industry s demand for disk drive components also fluctuates 
the disk drive industry experiences periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction  as in our fourth quarter of these cycles may affect suppliers to this industry because disk drive manufacturers tend to order more disk drive components than they may need during growth periods  and sharply reduce orders for these components during periods of contraction 
from time to time  disk drive manufacturers may compete more aggressively on price and exert downward price pressure on disk drive component suppliers 
if there is continued downward pressure on prices of disk drive components  our operating results could be negatively affected 
industry transitions in head technology and data density improvements impact demand for suspension assemblies 
during past industry transitions production yields of head and disk drive manufacturers initially were reduced 
because a significant portion of head yield reduction occurs after the head is bonded onto the suspension assembly  low yields at our customers  as in  often result in increased demand for suspension assemblies 
when our customers improve their production yields  as in  overall demand for our products may be negatively impacted 
our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if a reduction in the industry s component demand continues long term or a future significant slowdown in the industry occurs 
we may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements  which may negatively affect our operating results 
we increase our production capacity and the overhead that supports production based on anticipated market demand 
market demand  however  has not always developed as expected or remained at a consistent level 
the underutilization that can result decreases our profitability 
for example  in  market demand for our suspension assemblies was below our expectations primarily due to our loss of market share in the mature desktop segment of the disk drive market 
this resulted in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity 
as a result  our profitability also was below our expectations 
the following factors complicate accurate capacity planning for market demand changes in the demand for and mix of specific products our customers buy and the features they require  our ability to add and train staff to operate our production equipment in advance of demand  the market s pace of technological change  variability in our manufacturing yields and productivity  and long lead times for most of our plant and equipment expenditures  requiring major financial commitments well in advance of actual production requirements 
our inability to plan our capacity requirements accurately and efficiently utilize our production capacity  or our failure to put in place the technologies and capacity necessary to meet market demand  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our sales are concentrated in a small customer base 
although we supply nearly all domestic and foreign based manufacturers of disk drives and head gimbal assemblers  sales to our five largest customers constituted  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
over the years  the disk drive industry has experienced numerous consolidations 
in september  tdk corporation acquired the recording head business of our customer alps electric co  ltd 
in addition  in august  tdk corporation also announced it had signed a purchase agreement to acquire mpt with an expected closing date by the end of calendar these consolidations  together with companies exiting the disk drive industry  result in fewer  but larger  customers for our products 
the failure by any one of our customers to pay its account balance with us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the following factors could adversely impact our market share loss of market share by one of our major customers  change in supply chain alignment by a customer  loss of one or more of our major customers for any reason  including the development by any one customer of the capability to produce suspension assemblies in high volume for its own products  and change in the type of suspension assembly used by a customer 
any reduction in our market share could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be able to manufacture our products efficiently due to changes in product mix or technology  or other unforeseen events 
we manufacture a wide variety of suspension assemblies with different selling prices and manufacturing costs 
disk drive makers continue to expand their product lines to include drives offering performance characteristics optimized for specific applications  which has resulted in a proliferation of individual disk drive programs 
we cannot produce certain low volume disk drive programs as efficiently as we produce high volume programs 
our product mix varies as market demand changes 
any substantial variation in product mix can lead to changes in utilization of our equipment and tooling  inventory obsolescence and overstaffing in certain areas  all of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing yields  efficiencies and processing operations vary from product to product 
newer products often require new or additional manufacturing process steps and typically have lower initial manufacturing yields and efficiencies as we ramp up manufacturing 
as a result  new products are frequently more expensive to produce and may not be profitable 
we are using new manufacturing processes to produce tsa suspension assemblies  which may cause us to experience inefficiencies and lower yields 
we have experienced missed shipments and increased sales returns in the past as we ramp up manufacturing of new products  or as new features for our products are introduced  or as new manufacturing processes are implemented 
we also may in the future experience missed shipments or increased sales returns 
in addition  we may be required to reimburse customers for product costs relating to the incorporation of defective suspension assemblies into our customers products 
we may not attain our output goals and be profitable with regard to any of our suspension assembly products 
we may need to transfer production of certain suspension assemblies from one manufacturing site to another 
in the past  such transfers have lowered initial yields and or manufacturing efficiencies 
this results in higher manufacturing costs 
our manufacturing plants are located in minnesota  south dakota and wisconsin  all of which can experience severe weather 
severe weather has  at times  resulted in lower production and decreased our shipments 
our ability to conduct business would be impaired if our workforce were to be unionized or if a significant number of our specialized employees were to leave and we could not replace them with comparable personnel 
our business may be adversely affected if we need to adjust the size of our workforce due to fluctuating demand 
the locations of our plants and the broad span and technological complexity of our products and processes may limit the number of satisfactory engineering and other candidates for key positions 
if the rate of data density improves at a significantly faster rate than the rate of increase in the demand for disk drive storage  demand for suspension assemblies may decrease 
disk drive manufacturers have been able to steadily increase data density  and we believe that they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
increasing data density permits drive manufacturers to reduce the average number of disks in each disk drive  which in turn reduces the number of components they need per drive  including suspension assemblies 
from 
table of contents calendar through  the rate of improvement in data density exceeded historical rates  and we estimate that the average number of suspension assemblies required per drive decreased from approximately in calendar to approximately in calendar this contributed to a decrease in our total suspension assembly shipments from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in calendar  we estimate that the average number of suspension assemblies required per disk drive reached a low point of approximately in calendar  we estimate the average number of suspension assemblies required per disk drive increased to  which benefited demand 
we estimate the number has remained relatively stable in calendar and if improvements in data density again begin to outpace growth in data storage capacity requirements  then demand for our suspension assemblies may decline and we may not be able to maintain or expand our suspension assembly business 
a slowdown in demand for computer systems and consumer electronics may cause a decline in demand for suspension assemblies 
our suspension assemblies are components in computers and a variety of consumer electronics products 
the demand for these products can be volatile 
in a weak economy  consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for computers and other consumer electronics tends to decrease  as does business demand for computer systems 
demand for suspension assemblies therefore may be adversely impacted as a result of a weaker economy 
in addition  in the past  unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems and consumer electronics have caused sharp declines in demand for suspension assemblies  resulting in periods during which the supply of suspension assemblies exceeded demand 
if an unexpected slowdown in demand for suspension assemblies occurs or if demand decreases as a result of a weakening economy our results of operations will be materially adversely affected as a result of lower revenue and gross margins 
our investment in developing new process capabilities to produce suspension assemblies could result in significant increases in our operating expenses and may result in a product that is not acceptable to our customers 
rapid technological change in the disk drive industry  as well as the expanding use of disk drives in a growing range of consumer electronics applications  has led to numerous suspension assembly design changes and tighter performance specifications 
to maintain our position in the disk drive industry  we need to develop new process capabilities to achieve the ever increasing performance requirements of our customers 
also  if processes change  we may need to replace  modify or design  build and install equipment 
these changes may require additional capital expenditures and increased development and support expenses  which may adversely impact our operating results 
our and research and development expenses increased primarily due to investments in the development of new suspension assembly process capabilities and new products and product features 
we expect to continue to have significant research and development expenses for the following new products suspension assemblies that incorporate flexures produced using additive processing  suspension assemblies with tighter performance specifications than our customers currently require  suspension assemblies that require additional or smaller electrical conductors  suspension assemblies that incorporate new materials  such as thinner laminates  which are more difficult to handle in the manufacturing process  and suspension assemblies for use with smaller read write heads 
we have invested  and continue to invest  a substantial amount of engineering and manufacturing resources to develop process capabilities  including additive processing to produce suspension assembly flexures  to meet the ever increasing performance requirements of our customers 
additive processing involves depositing thin metal layers onto a polyimide surface in the shape of the desired circuitry and then imaging and plating up metal layers to form the suspension s electrical conductors 
although we expect to have volume production capabilities in place to fulfill customers requirements as the transition to tsa suspension assemblies begins  we do not expect to generate significant revenue from this product during if our development of additive process capabilities is delayed for any reason or if tsa suspension assemblies cannot be produced profitably in the quantities and to the specifications required by our customers  we may need to purchase increased quantities of additive components 
we may not be able to purchase the necessary quantity of such components on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the introduction of new process capabilities for our products increases the likelihood of unexpected quality concerns  which may negatively impact our ability to bring products to market on time and at acceptable costs 
further  most of our current competitors use components produced through additive processing for volume production of suspension 
table of contents assemblies  which may give them an advantage in developing and qualifying new products with our customers 
as we transition tsa suspension assemblies from development to high volume manufacturing  we will experience higher cost due to yield loss  production inefficiencies and equipment problems 
furthermore  our additive processing capability is added in large blocks of capacity  so certain equipment will be underutilized until demand develops 
demand for our suspension assemblies will decline if we are unable to qualify our products in disk drive programs 
we must qualify our products with our customers  including our tsa suspension assembly which is not yet in high volume production 
the qualification process for disk drive products can be complex and difficult 
we cannot be sure that our suspension assemblies will continue to be selected for design into our customers products 
if we are unable to obtain additional customer qualifications  or if we cannot qualify our products for high volume production quantities  or at all  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations 
our past operating results  and our gross margins  have fluctuated from fiscal period to period 
we expect our future operating results and gross margins will continue to fluctuate from fiscal period to period 
the following factors may cause these fluctuations changes in overall demand for our products  changes in utilization of existing or newly added production capacity  changes in our manufacturing yields and related scrap recovery  changes in our production efficiency  increased costs when we start producing new products and features  and ramping up high volume production  changes in the specific products our customers buy and features they require  changes in our selling prices  changes in our manufacturing process  or problems related to our manufacturing process  changes in our infrastructure costs and expected production and shipping costs  and how we control them  long disruptions in operations at any of our plants or our customers plants for any reason  and changes in the cost of  or limits on  available materials and labor 
our overall operating results in were favorably impacted by increased demand for data storage in traditional computing applications  as well as in consumer electronics applications  a slower rate of improvement in data density requiring additional disks to achieve the higher storage capacity required for many disk drive applications and our share positions on the types of disk drives in particularly high demand 
during the fourth quarter of  however  our operating results were negatively impacted by lighter demand  increased depreciation costs  a shift in product mix toward advanced suspension assembly products that are typically more costly to produce in the ramp up to higher volume partially offset by a related increase in our scrap recovery and increased labor expenses 
in the second half of  and in all of  we experienced underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and the associated depreciation and overhead costs 
although we continue to have limited visibility for future demand  we expect our profitability in will continue to benefit from the cost reductions completed in the third quarter of but capacity utilization and leverage of fixed costs will continue to be key to improving gross margin 
if customer demand for suspension assemblies weakens  or if one or more customers reduce  delay or cancel orders  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we typically allow customers to change or cancel orders on short notice 
we plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand  including forecasts of customer pulls of product out of our vmi facilities 
our customers often prefer a dual source supply and  therefore  may allocate their demand among suppliers 
both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially 
these factors  among others  create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary  leading to variability in gross margins and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace 
our selling prices are subject to market pressure from our competitors and pricing pressure from our customers 
for example  in our average selling prices declined as a result of planned price reductions triggered by higher volumes of certain suspension assemblies  as well as a change in the mix of products we sold 
our selling prices also are affected by changes in overall demand for our products  changes in the specific products our customers buy and a product s life cycle 
a typical life cycle for our products begins with higher pricing when products are introduced and decreasing prices as they mature 
to offset price decreases during a product s life  we rely primarily on higher sales volume and improving our manufacturing 
table of contents yields and efficiencies to reduce our cost 
disk drive manufacturers are increasingly seeking lower cost designs and suspension assembly pricing is becoming more competitive 
for example  in we competed aggressively to supply suspension assemblies for disk drive programs that are nearing the end of their market lives  and we will continue to do so 
while we produce suspension assemblies for these mature products very efficiently  our average selling price for these products is below the overall average selling price for all of our suspension assemblies 
if we cannot reduce our manufacturing costs as prices decline during our products life cycles  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if our customers improve their manufacturing yields  demand for our suspension assemblies may decrease 
we believe that improvements in our sales and unit volumes in and the first half of were due in part to manufacturing difficulties experienced by our customers as they transitioned to higher density read write heads 
these customers experienced higher levels of defective read write heads  which they were unable to detect until after they had attached the read write heads to our suspension assemblies 
our customers therefore required more suspension assemblies in those years 
we believe our customers improved their manufacturing yields  resulting in fewer suspension assemblies being lost to scrap in their manufacturing  which dampened demand growth in some of our customers may develop processes by which they either separate our suspension assemblies from a defective read write head in order to re use suspension assemblies or test the read write head to ensure it is not defective before they attach the suspension assembly 
if our customers production yields continue to improve in the future  or if they succeed in their process development efforts and can separate and re use suspension assemblies or test the read write head before attaching suspension assemblies  overall suspension assembly shipments will decline and our operating results could be negatively affected 
competing storage technology may reduce demand for our products 
other types of data storage technology  such as solid state storage or flash semiconductor memory  holographic memory  tape memory and optical dvd and cd drives  may become competitive with certain disk drive applications  and thereby could affect the demand for our products 
higher capacity storage needs typically have been better served by disk drives than by solid state storage such as flash memory  as disk drive manufacturers can offer more competitive cost per unit of capacity  while lower capacity needs increasingly are being met by flash memory technology 
if flash memory suppliers overcome both the technical and economic limitations of flash memory storage and can offer better performance or more competitive cost per unit of capacity than disk drive products  demand for disk drives  and thus for our products  may decrease 
though consumer applications for flash storage also increase the need for back up disk drives  mobile applications using flash memory storage also may displace the need for disk drive storage back up 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the computer industry adopts technology that replaces disk drives as a computer data storage medium 
competing process capabilities may reduce demand for our products 
we have historically defined our market leadership position through innovation and technological advancement that has enabled our customers to deploy higher disk drive capacities at lower total costs 
if we can no longer differentiate our product features or process capabilities  competing suppliers may have access to a greater percentage of disk drive programs and program share 
this inability to differentiate could be caused through our misunderstanding of market requirements  including technology changes  or through a market delay in advancing technology  which could enable a competitor to take market share 
the inability to differentiate our product offerings could also allow for supply chain alignments between our customers and other suppliers that could limit our access to available disk drive programs and corresponding market share 
these alignments could include share agreements  sole sourcing conditions or primary access to development programs 
any of the above scenarios could adversely impact our shipment volumes  average selling prices and operational costs 
we may have difficulty obtaining an adequate supply of raw materials that meet our strict specifications at reasonable prices 
certain types of stainless steel  as well as covercoat and liquid photoresist liquid compounds used in our manufacturing process  are currently single sourced because the raw materials provided by these sources meet our strict specifications 
we have chosen to obtain certain other materials  including gold salts and a laminate constructed from raw material that contains stainless steel  polyimide and copper  from a limited set of sources because of quality and pricing considerations 
if we were not able to obtain an adequate supply of these materials from our current suppliers  we could experience production delays and quality problems 

table of contents the price we pay for stainless steel and laminate periodically is reset and can fluctuate with changes in the value of the japanese yen  which will impact our costs 
the price we pay for gold salts and other precious metals has recently been increasing 
we typically do not pass this higher price on to our customers 
if we could not obtain the materials referred to above in the necessary quantities  with the necessary quality and at reasonable prices  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
biomeasurement division we do not know when  if ever  our biomeasurement division will be profitable 
we have a very limited operating history in the medical device market 
our first generation device was used primarily for research  and our second generation product  the inspectra sto system  was introduced to the trauma market late in calendar we do not know how many systems we will be able to sell  the sales breakdown between monitors and sensors  the margins we can expect or the amount of revenue that the product will generate 
we do not have another medical device product for sale  so all of the division s revenue will be derived from sales of the inspectra sto system 
we will continue to spend significant amounts of money on medical device sales and marketing and research and development  which will limit the division s profitability 
we may never generate enough revenue from medical device sales to offset our expenditures on the division 
we do not know whether our only medical product  the inspectra sto system  will achieve market acceptance 
our marketing strategy must overcome the difficulties inherent in the introduction of new products to the medical community 
clinicians will not use the inspectra sto system unless they conclude  based on clinical data and personal evaluation experience  that sto gives them information that is valuable when making treatment decisions 
if clinicians continue to rely on other methods when assessing the status of patients experiencing hemorrhagic shock  we will not be successful in selling the inspectra sto system 
the development of new medical technology to assess sto may render our product obsolete or uneconomical 
additionally  clinicians must be trained to use our inspectra sto system effectively 
convincing clinicians to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training in the use of our device is challenging  and we do not know whether we will be successful in these efforts 
if the inspectra sto system is not widely accepted by clinicians  is accepted more slowly than expected or is supplanted by superior technology  our sales may be materially adversely impacted 
the long sales cycle for the inspectra sto system will defer the generation of revenue by our biomeasurement division 
we expect that the inspectra sto system will have a long sales cycle because it involves the introduction of and education about a new measurement to potential customers 
we believe that the period between initial discussions with a potential customer and a sale of even a single device to that customer could take between six and twelve months  depending on the potential customer s budget and capital approval process 
training of clinicians also may take a number of weeks after a customer agrees to purchase the inspectra sto system 
in addition  reliance by our potential customers on third party payors  including government programs and private health insurance plans  to reimburse some or all of the cost of patient care  and cost containment measures that health care providers and third party payors are instituting  both in the united states and internationally  could harm our ability to sell our product 
these factors will create a significant lag in our ability to generate revenue and may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results going forward  particularly during periods in which our sales volume is relatively low 
we also plan to market the device by offering customers an evaluation followed by a sensor purchase program or monitor rental period 
these sales methods will further delay the generation of significant revenue 
we currently have limited experience as a company selling  marketing or distributing medical devices  which could impair the biomeasurement division s ability to achieve profitability 
we have limited experience as a company in the marketing  sale and distribution of medical devices 
we are marketing the inspectra sto system through a direct sales force 
developing a direct sales force is expensive and time consuming 
additionally  any direct sales force that we develop will be competing against the experienced sales organizations used by other manufacturers of medical devices 
we may not be able to develop this capability on a timely basis or at all 
we face significant challenges and risks in establishing a direct sales force and marketing our device  including our ability to recruit  train and retain adequate numbers of qualified sales and marketing personnel  the ability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of hospitals and trauma centers to purchase our device or clinicians to use our device  costs associated with 
table of contents hiring  maintaining and expanding a sales and marketing team  and government scrutiny associated with promotional activities in the health care industry 
if we are unable to establish and maintain a direct sales  marketing and distribution network  our biomeasurement division may be unable to generate revenue and may not become profitable  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to develop new applications for our product or expand our medical device product line successfully 
for the near term  all of our biomeasurement division s revenue will come through sales of the inspectra sto tissue oxygenation monitor and the inspectra sto sensor 
as a result  our initial success will depend on the success of the inspectra sto system 
if we are unable to widely commercialize the use of this system through our marketing initiatives  our biomeasurement division will not be profitable 
we are conducting research on other applications for the inspectra sto system and our near infrared spectroscopy technology 
the development of additional applications will require significant commitments of personnel and financial resources and we cannot be sure that they will be successful 
further  we cannot be sure that any new medical applications or medical devices we develop will receive regulatory approval or market acceptance 
if the attempted extensions of our product offerings or new products are not commercially successful  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
we have limited experience in manufacturing and assembling the inspectra sto system  and we may encounter problems at our manufacturing facility or otherwise experience manufacturing delays or warranty claims that could result in lost revenue 
we have limited experience in manufacturing  assembling or testing medical devices on a commercial scale 
in order to produce our inspectra sto system in quantities sufficient to meet our anticipated market demand  we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity by a significant factor over the current level 
there are technical challenges to increasing manufacturing capacity  including equipment design and automation  material procurement  problems with production yields and quality control and assurance 
developing commercial scale manufacturing facilities for our biomeasurement division will require the investment of substantial funds and the hiring and retaining of additional management and technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing expertise 
we may not successfully complete the required increase in manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  all of our manufacturing of the inspectra sto system is conducted at our facilities in hutchinson  minnesota 
we could encounter problems at these facilities  which could delay or prevent us from maintaining our manufacturing capabilities 
further  if our manufacturing quality control is not adequate  we may experience unanticipated product returns or warranty claims resulting in unforeseen expenses 
we may be unable to meet the expected demand for our inspectra sto system  maintain control over our expenses or quality or otherwise adapt to anticipated growth 
if we are unable to satisfy demand for our inspectra sto system  market acceptance of our products and our ability to generate revenue could be materially adversely affected 
we may fail to comply with manufacturing regulations  or be subject to product recalls  which could hurt our ability to sell and distribute our device and could subject us to fines  injunctions and penalties 
our manufacturing process must comply with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  which covers the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging and shipping of our device 
the fda enforces its qsr through inspections 
we may not pass an inspection  resulting in a shut down of our manufacturing operations  a recall of our device or the imposition of other sanctions  which could harm our revenues and profitability 
in addition  the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which our device may be sold may request and  in some cases  require the recall of our device in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
further  our key component suppliers may fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements 
any failure to comply with the qsr by us  any failure by our suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to them or any product recall could harm product sales and may subject us to fines  injunctions and penalties and damage our business 
we face the risk of product liability claims if the inspectra sto system fails to perform  and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance 
the business of our biomeasurement division exposes us to the risk of product liability claims inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of medical devices 
software defects in the monitor or other performance problems in the system could result in the system s failure to monitor tissue oxygenation accurately  which would subject us to product liability claims  and we may be subject to claims even if a medical failure is due to the actions of medical personnel using our product 
although we have product liability and clinical trial liability insurance that we believe is appropriate  this insurance is subject to 
table of contents deductibles and coverage limitations 
our current product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  or may not be adequate to cover any successful product liability claims 
a product liability claim  recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these liabilities also could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts 
defending a product liability claim  regardless of merit  could be costly  could divert management s attention from our business and might result in adverse publicity  which could adversely impact our business and financial performance 
general our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 
our management is required to provide our shareholders a report on our internal controls over financial reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls to provide reasonable assurance a material misstatement did not occur in our financial statements 
our management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to deferred tax assets and liabilities  which is discussed in item a of this annual report on form k 
as a result  our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of september  was not effective 
while the material weakness did not result in material changes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended september   it could have had such an effect 
we have taken steps to remediate the identified material weakness and to enhance our internal control over financial reporting 
while our management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  we cannot assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time 
other deficiencies may occur in the future 
such deficiencies  particularly a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting  could adversely affect our financial results  the market price of our common stock and our reputation 
we may have to invest a significant amount of funds over the next several years to achieve our long term growth objectives 
our business will require significant funds over the next several years 
we would likely use these funds for capital expenditures  research and development  debt service and working capital 
our disk drive components division is highly capital intensive 
our total capital expenditures for both of our divisions were  in   in and  in we currently anticipate spending  on capital expenditures during in addition  our total research and development expenses for both of our divisions were approximately  or of net sales in  and we expect that they will be approximately of net sales in our disk drive components division capital expenditures and research and development expenses were primarily for additions to both tsa suspension and tsa suspension manufacturing capacity  tooling  facilities and new process technology and capability improvements 
our capital expenditures for the disk drive components division are planned based on anticipated customer demand for our suspension assembly products  market demand for disk drives  process improvements to be incorporated in our manufacturing operations and the rate at which our customers adopt new generations of higher performance disk drives and next generation read write technology and head sizes which may require new or improved process technologies 
we manage our capital spending to reflect the capacity that will be needed to meet disk drive industry customer forecasts 
however  existing work in process with vendors and lengthy lead times sometimes prevent us from adjusting these capital expenditures to match near term demand 
this can result in underutilization of capacity  which could lower gross profit 
we expect to fund capital expenditures with cash generated from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents  securities available for sale  our credit facility or additional financing as needed 
we currently have outstanding  aggregate principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due the notes and  aggregate principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due the notes 
we may pursue additional debt or equity financing or other forms of financing to supplement our current capital resources  if needed  in and beyond 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results and general economic and capital market conditions 
we may not be able to maintain adequate capital or raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all  if needed 

table of contents the following factors could affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all our results of operations  general economic conditions and conditions in the disk drive industry  the perception in the capital markets of our business  our ratio of debt to equity  our financial condition  our business prospects  and changes in interest rates 
our ability to execute our long term strategy may depend on our ability to obtain additional long term debt and equity capital 
we have no commitments for additional borrowings  other than our existing  credit facility with lasalle bank national association  or for sales of equity  other than under our existing employee benefit plans 
we cannot determine the precise amount and timing of our funding needs at this time 
we may be unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we fail to comply with certain covenants relating to our indebtedness  we may need to refinance our indebtedness to repay it 
we also may need to refinance our indebtedness at maturity 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital on favorable terms to refinance our indebtedness 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights  trade secrets and other measures 
we may not  however  be able to obtain rights to protect our technology 
in addition  competitors may be able to develop similar technology independently 
our success in the disk drive industry depends in large part on trade secrets relating to our proprietary manufacturing processes 
our biomeasurement division is engaged in a market where third parties have significant existing patent portfolios 
we seek to protect trade secrets and our other proprietary technology in part by requiring each of our employees to enter into non disclosure  assignment and non competition agreements 
in these agreements  the employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all of our proprietary information and  subject to certain exceptions  to assign to us all rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her employment 
in addition  we regularly enter into non disclosure agreements with third parties  such as consultants  strategic suppliers and customers 
these agreements may  however  be breached  and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach 
in addition  our competitors may otherwise learn or independently develop our trade secrets 
we believe that the patents we hold and may obtain are valuable  but that they will not independently determine our success 
moreover  we may not receive patents for our pending patent applications  and our issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology adequately 
our future technology may not be protected  and any patent issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or infringed 
in addition  we have only limited patent rights outside the united states  and the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in the past  in connection with our disk drive industry business  we have entered into licensing and cross licensing agreements relating to certain of our patents and patent applications allowing some of our competitors to produce products similar to ours in return for royalty payments and or cross license rights 
in november  we entered into cross license agreements with three suspension assembly suppliers  and in october  we entered into an additional cross licensing agreement with an additional suspension assembly supplier  enabling each of them to offer customers in the disk drive industry tsa suspension assemblies based on our proprietary technology 
the agreements also include cross licenses to certain existing and future suspension assembly technology 
should these competitors become successful at producing tsa suspension assemblies in high volume  our demand could be reduced and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we and certain users of our disk drive industry products have received  and may receive  communications from third parties asserting patents against us or our customers that may relate to certain of our manufacturing equipment or to our products or to products that include our products as a component 
in addition  we and certain of our disk drive industry customers have been sued on patents having claims closely related to disk drive industry products we sell 
if any third party makes a valid infringement claim against us and we are unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we expect that  as the number of patents issued in 
table of contents connection with our disk drive industry business continues to increase  the volume of intellectual property claims made against us could increase 
we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us  protect trade secrets or know how owned by us  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
we have litigated claims against a competitive disk drive industry supplier alleging infringement of our patents 
we could incur substantial costs in other such litigation or other similar legal actions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  frequent and extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights are hallmarks of the medical technology industry  and this litigation is expensive  complex and lengthy  and its outcome is difficult to predict 
medical technology patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that may prevent the sale of our product and significantly divert the attention of our biomeasurement division technical and management personnel 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully defend our patents from infringement or claims of invalidity or unenforceability  or that we will successfully defend against allegations of infringement of third party patents 
we have been named as a defendant in  and are the subject of  certain legal proceedings which may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
as described in legal proceedings below  a federal securities class action suit was filed naming our company and certain of our officers and directors as co defendants 
the suit was dismissed with prejudice by the district court and the dismissal has been appealed to the federal appellate court where it remains pending 
a related derivative action also was filed naming our company  as a nominal defendant  all of our present directors and one of our officers as co defendants  but it was dismissed without prejudice in april we were informed on may   that the sec has opened an investigation into possible federal securities law violations by our company  our officers  directors  employees and others  during and the investigation includes the matters alleged in the federal securities class action litigation described above 
we do not know when or how the investigation might be concluded 
we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation or investigation 
as described in legal proceedings below  we have also been named as a defendant in a class action suit brought by current and former production workers 
it is possible that any of these matters could be resolved adversely to us  could result in substantial costs and could divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
risks associated with legal liability often are difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time 
while we maintain director and officer insurance  the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover a claim and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured 
we may in the future be the target of additional proceedings  and these proceedings may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  and any difference between our estimates and actual results in those areas could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
estimates of our income tax provision  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets are subject to uncertainty due to the use of estimates  significant management judgment and possible examination by applicable jurisdictions 
valuation allowances arise due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of certain tax credits and net operating loss nol carryforwards before they expire  and are based on our historical taxable income and our estimates of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
at september  and september  we had valuation allowances of  and  respectively  related primarily to certain tax credits and the uncertainty of realizing these benefits before they expire due to certain limitations 
in the event that actual results differ from estimates  our financial position and results of operations could be negatively impacted

we believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated requirements for item legal proceedings securities litigation our company and six of our present executive officers  two of whom are directors  were named as defendants in a consolidated complaint filed by several investors in the us district court for the district of minnesota on may  the consolidated complaint purported to be brought on behalf of a class of all persons except defendants who purchased our stock in the open market between october  and august  the class period 
the consolidated complaint alleged that the defendants made false and misleading public statements about our company  and our business and prospects  in press releases and sec filings during the class period  and that the market price of our stock was artificially inflated as a result 
the consolidated complaint alleged claims under sections b and a of the exchange act 
the consolidated complaint sought compensatory damages on behalf of the alleged class in an unspecified amount  interest  an award of attorneys fees and costs of litigation  and unspecified equitable injunctive relief 
defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint 
by memorandum opinion and order filed on june   the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed the consolidated complaint with prejudice 
plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit  and the appeal remains pending 
we do not know when the court of appeals will decide the appeal  or how it might rule 
we believe that we  and the other defendants  have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the consolidated complaint  and we intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously 
we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation  but it may be costly and disruptive 
the total costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
securities class action litigation can result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations  including our cash flows

general since the late s  we have derived virtually all of our revenue from the sale of suspension assemblies to a small number of customers 
we currently supply a variety of suspension assemblies and suspension assembly components to nearly all domestic and foreign based manufacturers of disk drives and head gimbal assemblers for all sizes of disk drives 
suspension assemblies are a critical component of disk drives  and our results of operations are highly dependent on the disk drive industry 
the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and demand for disk drive components fluctuates 
our results of operations are affected from time to time by disk drive industry demand changes  adjustments in inventory levels throughout the disk drive supply chain  technological changes that impact suspension assembly demand  shifts in our market position and our customers market position  our customers production yields and our own product transitions  production yields and production capacity utilization 
our biomeasurement division is engaged in the development  production and marketing of products for the medical device market 
we do not expect to generate significant revenue from the inspectra sto system during and anticipate an operating loss for this division 

table of contents for calendar storage industry analysts expect disk drive shipments to reach million units  an increase of about from calendar the growth in disk drive shipments is resulting from increased demand for data storage in traditional computing applications  as well as in consumer electronics applications 
our shipments of suspension assemblies in were million  higher than our shipments in this increase was due to our fiscal year having weeks and the year over year increase in disk drive shipments 
for calendar year  storage industry analysts are forecasting unit shipments of disk drives to increase by at least 
this growth in disk drive shipments will  in turn  continue to generate growth in demand for suspension assemblies 
we expect that our share in the desktop segment  the largest segment of the market  will continue to decline as certain programs for which we are a major supplier approach the end of their market lives 
we expect to counter this decline somewhat by further increasing our share in the faster growing mobile segment and continuing our strong leadership position in the enterprise computing segment 
the following table sets forth our recent quarterly suspension assembly shipment quantities in millions for the periods indicated by quarter by quarter first second third fourth first second third fourth suspension assembly shipment quantities the decrease in suspension assembly shipments from the second quarter to the third quarter of resulted  we believe  from seasonally slower demand for disk drives used in desktop applications and certain head gimbal assemblers and disk drive manufacturers managing existing inventories 
we believe the increase in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of reflects a seasonal improvement in the desktop and mobile disk drive segments and growth in the consumer electronics disk drive segment 
the decrease in the second quarter of was primarily due to weaker demand for suspension assemblies used in desktop more specifically  inch ata disk drives 
the decrease in the third quarter of was primarily due to continued share loss for our suspension assemblies used in inch ata disk drives and seasonally slower demand 
the inch ata segment share loss was partially offset as we continued to improve our position in the faster growing  but smaller  mobile segment of the disk drive market 
our fourth quarter of shipments increased due to seasonally strong demand for disk drives  our fiscal quarter having fourteen weeks and our continued market share gains in the mobile segment of the disk drive market 
we continue to have limited visibility for future demand 
our selling prices are subject to market pressure from our competitors and pricing pressure from our customers 
disk drive manufacturers are increasingly seeking lower cost designs and suspension assembly pricing is becoming more competitive 
in we competed aggressively to supply suspension assemblies for disk drive programs that are nearing the end of their market lives  and we will continue to do so 
while we produce suspension assemblies for these mature products very efficiently  our average selling price for these mature products is below the overall average selling price for all of our suspension assemblies 
our selling prices also are affected by changes in overall demand for our products  changes in the specific products our customers buy and a product s life cycle 
a typical life cycle for our products begins with higher pricing when products are introduced and decreasing prices as they mature 
to offset price decreases during a product s life  we rely primarily on higher sales volume and improving our manufacturing yields and efficiencies to reduce our cost 
if we cannot increase our sales volume or reduce our manufacturing costs as prices decline during our products life cycles  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in  our average selling price held about flat with our average selling price as a result of lower program pricing of certain high volume suspension assemblies  offset by suspension assemblies that include higher priced value added features such as dual stage actuation  clad unamount arms  plated grounds  electrostatic protection measures  formed and polished headlifts  a variety of limiter configurations  dampers and laminated loadbeams 
in  our average selling price declined from our average selling price at the end of primarily due to a sales mix that included a higher percentage of suspension assemblies for mature disk drive programs 
customers extended the lives of certain mature disk drive programs  and we competed aggressively on these programs 
the average selling price is typically lower on suspension assemblies for mature disk drive programs as higher cumulative volumes trigger lower price points and the competitive pressure increases as our competitors abilities to manufacture these products improves 
we expect our average selling price to remain relatively flat compared to 
table of contents we typically allow customers to change or cancel orders on short notice 
we plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand  including forecasts of customer pulls of product out of our vmi facilities 
certain agreements with our customers also provide that we maintain minimum finished goods inventory levels for them 
our customers often prefer a multiple source supply strategy and  therefore  may allocate their demand among suppliers 
both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially 
these factors  among others  create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary significantly from week to week  leading to variability in gross margins and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace 
our gross margins have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate based upon a variety of factors such as changes in demand or customer requirements  utilization of existing or newly added production capacity  manufacturing yields or efficiencies  product and feature mix  selling prices  production and engineering costs associated with production of new products and features  and costs of materials 
gross margin in was  down from in  due to higher depreciation and overhead expense coupled with underutilization of manufacturing equipment as we added capacity throughout the year 
the negative impact of the underutilization was somewhat mitigated by improvements in yields and labor productivity 
in  gross margin was primarily due to higher manufacturing overhead expense coupled with continued underutilization of manufacturing equipment  which was somewhat offset by improvements in labor productivity and yields 
during the third quarter of  we eliminated approximately positions in our workforce  including manufacturing and manufacturing support  administrative and development positions at all plant sites 
the workforce reduction resulted in a charge for severance expenses of  which was fully paid during the fourth quarter of we also recorded a charge of  for the write off of design costs for a cancelled facility expansion 
we estimate that these cost reduction actions will result in annualized savings of approximately  our profitability will continue to benefit from these cost reductions  but capacity utilization and leverage of fixed costs will continue to be key to improving gross margin 
our suspension assembly business is capital intensive 
for  capital expenditures for the year totaled  primarily for additions to both tsa suspension and tsa suspension manufacturing capacity  facilities and tooling and for new process technology equipment 
in november  we completed an expansion at our manufacturing facility located in eau claire  wisconsin by adding a production bay with an above ground footprint of approximately  square feet to accommodate a volume tsa suspension production line 
for our capital expenditures were  primarily for tsa suspension production capacity  new program tooling and deployment of new process technology and capability improvements 
capital spending for is currently expected to be approximately our capital expenditures for the disk drive components division are planned based on anticipated customer demand for our suspension assembly products  market demand for disk drives  process improvements to be incorporated in our manufacturing operations and the rate at which our customers adopt new generations of higher performance disk drives and next generation read write technology and head sizes which may require new or improved process technologies 
we manage our capital spending to reflect the capacity that we expect will be needed to meet disk drive industry customer forecasts 
however  existing work in process with vendors and lengthy lead times sometimes prevent us from adjusting capital expenditures to match near term demand 
this can result in underutilization of capacity  which could lower gross profit 
we expect to fund capital expenditures with cash generated from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents  securities available for sale  our credit facility or additional financing as needed 
we spent  on research and development in compared to  in in  we continued development of the additive processes required for our tsa suspension assemblies and development of new process technologies for next generation suspension assembly products and equipment 
research and development spending specific to our biomeasurement division was  in and  in biomeasurement division spending was lower in primarily due to decreased product development and clinical research during the year 
we expect our research and development spending in will be approximately of net sales  down from in 
table of contents the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and our customers operating results are dependent on being the first to market and first to volume with new products at a low cost 
our development efforts typically enable us to shorten development cycles and achieve high volume output per manufacturing unit more quickly than our competitors  and are an important factor in our success 
the development of next generation read write technology and head sizes will require finer electrical conductors on the suspension assembly 
our current tsa suspensions are produced using a subtractive process  and we continue to invest in extending our current process capabilities and adding associated capital equipment for manufacturing tsa suspension assemblies to meet escalating customer requirements for precision and performance 
we have also developed an additive process and added associated capital equipment for producing tsa suspension assemblies 
additive processing involves depositing thin metal layers onto a polyimide surface in the shape of the desired circuitry and then imaging and plating up metal layers to form the suspension s electrical conductors 
we are working with multiple customers on tsa suspensions for their next generation disk drive programs 
we have completed installation of a volume tsa suspension production line  and we are preparing our tsa operations for higher volume 
we expect the transition to tsa suspensions to take place over the next five to seven years  with the pace of transition determined primarily by the pace at which disk drive makers introduce and ramp production of programs requiring additive processing 
as a result  we do not expect to generate significant revenue from this product during we are also purchasing some additive components to fill other existing customer development requirements 
as we transition tsa suspension assemblies from development to high volume manufacturing  we may experience higher cost due to yield loss  production inefficiencies and equipment problems 
furthermore  our additive processing capability is added in large blocks of capacity  and certain equipment will therefore be underutilized until demand develops 
if our development of additive process capabilities is delayed for any reason or if tsa suspension assemblies cannot be produced profitably in the quantities and to the specifications required by our customers  we may continue to purchase additive components 
new manufacturing processes for advanced suspension assembly features and suspension assembly types  such as those currently under development  initially have lower manufacturing yields than those for more mature products and processes 
manufacturing yields generally improve as the process and product mature and production volumes increase 
manufacturing yields also vary depending on the complexity and uniqueness of products 
small variations in manufacturing yields can have a significant impact on gross margins 
in addition to increases in suspension assembly demand  improvements to our gross margins and operating margins will depend  in part  on the successful management of our corporate infrastructure and our suspension assembly production capacity 
our business is capital intensive and requires a high level of fixed costs 
our margins are sensitive to our level of fixed costs  as well as changes in volume  capacity utilization and product mix 
as part of our efforts to improve our operating results  we eliminated approximately positions during the third quarter of in the future  we may need to increase or decrease our overall employment level to meet customer requirements 
our overall employment level was  at the end of   at the end of and  at the end of in  we also had production workers supplied by temporary staffing agencies 
market trends we expect that the expanding use of enterprise computing and storage  desktop and mobile computers  increasingly complex software and the growth of new applications for disk storage  such as personal video recorders and portable video players  together with emerging opportunities in other consumer electronics applications  will increase disk drive demand and  therefore  suspension assembly demand in the future 
we also believe demand for disk drives will continue to be subject  as it has in the past  to rapid or unforeseen changes resulting from  among other things  changes in disk drive inventory levels  technological advances  responses to competitive price changes  unpredicted high or low market acceptance of new drive models and the end devices that disk drives are used in 
in addition  disk drive manufacturers are increasingly seeking lower cost designs and suspension assembly pricing is becoming more competitive 
as in past years  disk drives continue to be the primary storage device of choice for applications requiring shorter access times and higher capacities because of their speed and low cost per gigabyte of stored data 
the cost of storing data on disk drives continues to decrease primarily due to increasing data density  thereby increasing storage capacity in disk drives or reducing the number of components  including suspension assemblies  required in a disk drive 
the continual pursuit of increased data density and lower storage costs is leading to suspension assemblies with finer electrical conductors and further 
table of contents adoption of value added features for suspension assemblies  such as clad unamount arms  plated grounds  electrostatic protection measures  formed and polished headlifts  a variety of limiter configurations  dampers  laminated loadbeams and dual stage actuation 
the development of next generation read write technology and head sizes  continuing improvement in data density and the use of disk drives in consumer electronics applications will require even finer electrical conductors on the suspension assembly 
next generation disk drives also may require additional electrical conductors 
we are investing significantly in developing the process capabilities and related capital equipment required to meet new industry specifications in and beyond 
the introduction of new types or sizes of read write heads and disk drives may initially decrease our customers yields with the result that we may experience temporary elevations of demand for some types of suspension assemblies 
for example  we believe reduced yields for some of our customers due to their transition to higher density read write heads resulted in increased shipments of our suspension assemblies in and the first half of as programs mature  higher customer yields decrease the demand for suspension assemblies 
the advent of new heads and new drive designs may require rapid development and implementation of new suspension assembly types  which may temporarily increase our development spending and reduce our manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
these changes will continue to affect us

following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue in any period  we apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  as amended and codified by staff accounting bulletin no 
 update of codification of staff accounting bulletins codification of staff accounting bulletins  topic revenue recognition  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revision of topic codification of staff accounting bulletins  topic revenue recognition  section a selected revenue recognition issues 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs associated with products sold are classified as revenue 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
certain of our products are delivered on an fob destination basis 
we defer our revenue associated with these transactions until the product has been delivered to the customer s premises 
we also store disk drive components division inventory in vmi facilities  which are warehouses located close to the customer s manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from such facilities upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
we also enter into arrangements with customers that provide us with reimbursement for guaranteed capacity 
we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated life of the program for which the capacity is guaranteed 
accounts receivable we are dependent on a limited number of customers  and as a result  our trade accounts receivable is highly concentrated 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectability based on past transaction history with the customer and the customer s financial condition 
while we perform ongoing credit reviews of our customers and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts  a significant deterioration in the financial condition of any significant customer may result in additional charges to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts or to write off certain accounts 

table of contents we record a provision against revenue for estimated returns on sales of our products in the same period that the related revenues are recognized 
we base the allowance on historical returns  as well as existing product return authorizations 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market by analyzing market conditions  current sales prices  inventory costs and inventory balances 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers and a limited number of product programs for each customer 
because our products are custom built  we typically cannot shift work in process or finished goods from customer to customer or from one program to another for a particular customer 
we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or market based on the analysis 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value would generally be determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized based on future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or a benefit within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances arise due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of certain tax credits and nol carryforwards before they expire  and are based on our historical taxable income and our estimates of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
at september  and september  we had valuation allowances of  and  respectively  related primarily to certain tax credits and the uncertainty of realizing these benefits before they expire due to certain limitations 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable  and the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
other matters we are involved in certain legal matters which may result in additional future cash requirements 
we are unable to estimate the future cash requirements if any 
see the discussion of these matters in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab permits us to adjust for the cumulative effect of misstatements related to prior years  previously deemed to be immaterial  in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal year  with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
sab also requires the adjustment of any prior quarterly financial statements in future sec filings within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such misstatements on the quarters when the information is next presented 
this adjustment does not require reports previously filed with the sec to be amended 

table of contents effective september   we elected early application of sab in accordance with sab  we reduced our opening retained earnings for by  net of tax of  and adjusted our financial results for the first three quarters of as shown in the tables below 
we consider this adjustment to be immaterial to prior periods 
our sab adjustment relates to one customer arrangement whereby certain revenues that were recorded in and should have been deferred 
deferred revenue amounts related to this arrangement are included within accrued expenses and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  based on our approach for assessing misstatements prior to the adoption of sab  we had previously concluded that these amounts were immaterial 
the impact of this adjustment for the first three quarters of is presented below in thousands  except per share data

the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law on october  the ajca contains two provisions that affect us 
the first provision is the repeal of the eie provisions  which were phased out on a calendar year basis with the benefit ending december  the second provision of the ajca that affects us is the introduction of a deduction for a percentage of income from domestic production activities 
the deduction is limited in any fiscal year in which a taxpayer uses nol carryforwards 
for our fiscal year ended september   we will not receive any benefit from this deduction  as we will use nol carryforwards 
the deduction is phased in on a calendar year basis and will be fully phased in for our fiscal year ending september  inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial condition 
we cannot be sure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our credit facility with lasalle bank national association carries interest rate risk  in connection with certain borrowings for which it provides  that is generally related to either libor or the prime rate 
if either of these rates were to change while we had such borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  interest expense would increase or decrease accordingly 
at september   there were no outstanding loans under the credit facility 
we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risk on our other debt obligations which are subject to fixed interest rates 
interest rate changes  however  would affect the fair market value of this fixed rate debt
