item business unless the context requires otherwise  references in this report to old dominion  the company  we  us and our refer to old dominion freight line  inc general we are a leading less than truckload ltl multi regional motor carrier providing one to five day service among five regions in the united states and next day and second day service within these regions 
we operate as one business segment and offer an expanding array of innovative products and services through our four branded product groups  od domestic  od expedited  od global and od technology 
at december   we provided full state coverage to of the states that we served directly within the southeast  south central  northeast  midwest and west regions of the country 
through marketing and carrier relationships  we also provided service to and from the remaining states as well as international services around the globe 
we plan to continue to expand our service center network  as opportunities arise  to achieve our strategic goal of providing full state coverage throughout the continental united states 
these additions should also provide a platform for future growth and ensure that our service center network has sufficient capacity 
we have grown substantially over the last several years through strategic acquisitions and internal growth 
prior to  we provided inter regional service to major metropolitan areas from  and regional service within  the southeast region of the united states 
since  we have expanded our infrastructure to provide next day and second day service within four additional regions as well as expanded inter regional service among those regions 
from through december   we increased our number of service centers from to and our states directly served from to we believe that our present infrastructure will enable us to increase freight density  which is to increase the volume of freight moving through our network  and thereby improve our profitability 
we are committed to providing our customers with high quality service 
we are continually upgrading our technological capabilities to improve customer service  reduce our transit times and minimize our operating costs 
in addition to our core ltl services  we provide other specialized services including premium expedited services  truckload services  truckload brokerage services  logistical solutions  container delivery service to and from ten port facilities and distribution services in which we either consolidate ltl shipments for full truckload transport by a truckload carrier or convert full truckload shipments from a truckload carrier into ltl shipments for our delivery 
we provide consistent customer service from a single organization offering our customers information and pricing from one point of contact 
our multi regional competitors that offer inter regional service typically do so through independent companies or with separate points of contact within different operating segments of the 
table of contents company  which can result in inconsistent service and pricing  as well as poor shipment visibility 
our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent and continuous service across all areas of operations and service products 
old dominion was founded in and incorporated in virginia in please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item of this report for information regarding our total assets  revenue from operations and net income 
our industry trucks provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options 
the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers truckload and ltl 
truckload carriers generally provide an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination 
ltl carriers pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route the goods through service centers where freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations for delivery 
in contrast to truckload carriers  ltl motor carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery service centers  as well as larger breakbulk  or hub  facilities 
the significant capital that ltl motor carriers must commit to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers makes it difficult for new start up or small operations to effectively compete with established companies 
in addition  successful ltl motor carriers generally employ a high level of technology to provide information to customers and to reduce operating costs 
service center operations at december   we conducted operations through service center locations  of which we own and lease we operate major breakbulk facilities in atlanta  georgia  rialto  california  indianapolis  indiana  greensboro  north carolina  harrisburg  pennsylvania  memphis and morristown  tennessee  and dallas  texas  while using some smaller service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve next day markets 
our service centers are strategically located in five regions of the country to provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 
each of our service centers is responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight for its service area 
each service center loads outbound freight by destination the day it is picked up 
all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day  unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule 
our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations 
while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level  our customers may access information and initiate transactions through several different gateways such as our website  electronic data interchange  automated voice response systems  automated fax systems or through our customer service department located at the corporate office 
our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking  shipping documents  rate quotes  rate databases and account activity 
linehaul transportation linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight among service centers through integrated freight movement systems 
we also utilize load planning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations 
our senior management continuously monitors freight movements  transit times  load factors and other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our highest levels of service and efficiency 
we utilize scheduled routes  and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary  to meet our published service standards 
in addition  we lower our cost structure by maintaining flexible work force rules and by primarily 
table of contents using twin foot trailers exclusively in our linehaul operations 
the use of twin foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading  which also reduces cargo claims expenses 
we also utilize long combination vehicles  such as triple foot trailers and combinations of foot and foot trailers  in states where permitted 
twin trailers and long combination vehicles permit more freight to be hauled behind a tractor than could be hauled by one larger trailer 
tractors  trailers and maintenance at december   we operated  tractors 
we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pickup and delivery operations for the remainder of the assets useful lives 
in a number of our service centers  tractors perform pickup and delivery functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 
at december   we operated a fleet of  trailers 
we primarily purchase new trailers for our operations  however  we occasionally purchase pre owned equipment meeting our specifications from other trucking companies 
we have also acquired tractors and trailers through our acquisition of business assets from other carriers 
the purchase of pre owned equipment can provide an excellent value  but can increase our fleet s average age 
the table below reflects  as of december   the average age of our tractors and trailers type of equipment categorized by primary use number of units average age linehaul tractors pickup and delivery tractors pickup and delivery trucks linehaul trailers pickup and delivery trailers we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers  the production and purchase of which are negotiated with several manufacturers 
these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers production schedules 
we believe that there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations and planned growth 
the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december   and our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers in provided the capacity to support our continued growth and geographic expansion and  to a lesser extent  to replace equipment as part of our normal replacement cycle 
year ended december  in thousands tractors trailers total at december   we had major maintenance operations at our service centers in los angeles and rialto  california  denver  colorado  atlanta  georgia  chicago  illinois  indianapolis  indiana  parsons  kansas  jersey city  new jersey  greensboro  north carolina  columbus  ohio  harrisburg  pennsylvania  morristown and memphis  tennessee  dallas  texas  and salt lake city  utah 
in addition  nine other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 
we have established maintenance policies and procedures 
linehaul tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage or time intervals  depending upon how the equipment was utilized 
pickup and delivery tractors and trailers are scheduled for maintenance every days 

table of contents marketing and customers at december   we had a sales staff of employees 
we compensate our sales force  in part  based upon revenue generated  company and service center profitability and on time service performance  which we believe helps to motivate our employees to achieve our service  growth and profitability objectives 
we utilize a computerized freight costing model to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable 
we can modify elements of this freight costing model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved 
we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations 
customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years  and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 
revenue is generated from many customers and locations across the united states and north america 
in  our largest customer accounted for approximately of revenue and our largest  and customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue  respectively 
for each of the previous three years  less than of our revenue was generated from international services 
we believe the diversity of our revenue base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 
competition the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service 
at december   we were the seventh largest ltl carrier in the united states  as measured by revenue 
we compete with regional  inter regional and national ltl carriers and  to a lesser extent  with truckload carriers  small package carriers  airfreight carriers and railroads 
competition is based primarily on personal relationships  price and service 
we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices 
we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors 
we believe this performance is due in part to our more efficient service center network  use of team drivers and investment in technology 
in addition  we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors 
we believe our diversified mix and scope of regional and inter regional services enable us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their ltl shipping needs and provides us with a distinct advantage over our regional  multi regional and national competition 
we also believe our non union workforce gives us a significant advantage over our unionized ltl competition 
advantages of our workforce include flexible hours and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks  which we believe result in greater productivity  customer service  efficiency and cost savings 
we compete with several larger transportation service providers  each of which may have more equipment  a broader coverage network and a wider range of services than we do 
our larger competitors also have greater financial resources and  in general  the ability to reduce prices to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy 
this could potentially limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain significant growth 
seasonality our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in the motor carrier industry 
financial results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced shipments during the winter months 
harsh winter weather can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses 
freight volumes typically build to a peak in the third quarter and early fourth quarter  which generally result in improved operating margins 

table of contents technology we continually upgrade our technological capabilities  and we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information 
we also employ freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times

each barcoded shipment is monitored by these devices  which provides for real time tracing and freight management 
handheld computer system 
handheld computers provide direct communication to our systems and allow our drivers to capture information during pickups and deliveries  including individual pieces and weights as well as origin and destination shipping points 
timely pickup information allows for better direct loading and efficient scheduling of linehaul operations and enhances real time information for our customers visibility of their supply chain 
pickup and delivery optimation system 
this mapping system is utilized by our service centers to improve the efficiency of pickup and delivery p d routes 
the optimization of our p d routes improves the efficiency of our operations  reduces costs and reduces transit times 
in addition  this system enhances labor productivity by determining proper staffing and providing the most efficient freight loading patterns at our service centers 

table of contents insurance we carry significant insurance with third party insurance carriers and we self insure a portion of this risk 
we are currently self insured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to  per occurrence 
this self insured retention level was increased from  during the previous plan year ended march  cargo loss and damage claims are self insured up to  per occurrence 
we are exposed to workers compensation claims up to  per occurrence  through either self insurance or insurance deductibles  for the states in which we operate 
group health claims are self insured up to  per occurrence and long term disability claims are self insured to a maximum per individual of  per month 
we believe that our policy of self insuring a portion of our risk  together with our safety and loss prevention programs  is an effective means of managing insurance costs 
we also believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover our liability risks 
diesel fuel availability and cost our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel 
from time to time  we may experience shortages at certain locations and have been forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules 
we have experienced higher diesel fuel costs in recent years and  as a result  implemented a fuel surcharge program in august that has remained in effect since that time 
our fuel surcharges  which are generally indexed to the us department of energy s published fuel prices  were implemented to offset the additional cost of diesel fuel and are consistent with our competitors practices 
our management believes that our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors 
diesel fuel costs  including fuel taxes  totaled of revenue in employees as of december   we employed  individuals on a full time basis in the following categories category number of employees drivers platform fleet technicians sales salaried  clerical and other as of december   we employed  linehaul drivers and  pickup and delivery drivers 
all of our drivers are selected based upon driving records and experience 
drivers are required to pass drug tests and have a current united states department of transportation dot physical and a valid commercial driver s license prior to employment 
once employed  drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver s licenses 
drivers are also required to take drug and alcohol tests periodically  by random selection 
to help fulfill driver needs  we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the old dominion driver training program 
since its inception in   individuals have graduated from this program  from which we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately 
we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record 
drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses of up to  annually 
driver safety bonuses paid during were  our focus on communication and the continued education  development and motivation of our employees helps to ensure that our relationship with our employees remains excellent 
there are no employees represented under a collective bargaining agreement  which we believe is an important factor in our continued success 

table of contents governmental regulation we are regulated by the surface transportation board  an agency within the dot  and by various state agencies 
these regulatory authorities have broad powers  generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations  hours of service  certain mergers  consolidations and acquisitions  and periodic financial reporting 
the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes  such as increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations  limits on vehicle weight and size  ergonomics and hours of service 
these changes may affect the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices  increasing our cost and influencing the demand for our services 
we believe that the cost of compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not and will not materially affect our results of operations or financial condition 
environmental regulation we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on the transportation of certain materials  the discharge or retention of storm water and the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence on or in our properties  vehicles and fuel storage tanks 
under certain environmental laws  we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal or fiscal item a 
risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report  the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements we operate in a highly competitive industry  and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 
numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes  some of which may have more equipment  a broader coverage network  a wider range of services  greater capital resources or have other competitive advantages  some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain significant growth  many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting core carriers as approved transportation service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected  many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors  the trend towards consolidation in the ground transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size  advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments  and competition from non asset based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and pricing policies 

table of contents if our employees were to unionize  our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 
none of our employees are currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
however  from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers 
we can make no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results because some shippers have indicated that they intend to limit their use of unionized trucking companies because of the threat of strikes and other work stoppages  restrictive work rules could hamper our efforts to improve and sustain operating efficiency  a strike or work stoppage would hurt our profitability and could damage customer and employee relationships  and an election and bargaining process would distract our time and attention from our overall objectives and impose significant expenses 
these results  and unionization of our workforce generally  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy  our business and future results of operations may suffer 
our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network  selectively expanding our geographic footprint and broadening the scope of our service offerings 
in connection with our growth strategy  we have purchased additional equipment  expanded and upgraded service centers  hired additional personnel and increased our sales and marketing efforts  and expect to continue to do so 
our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks  including the following geographic expansion and acquisitions require start up costs that could expose us to temporary losses  growth through acquisition could require us to temporarily match existing freight rates of the acquiree s markets  which may be lower than the rates that we would typically charge for our services  growth and geographic expansion is dependent on the availability of real estate 
shortages of suitable real estate may limit our geographic expansion and might cause congestion in our service center network  which could result in increased operating expenses  growth may strain our management  capital resources  information systems and customer service  hiring new employees may increase training costs and may result in temporary inefficiencies until the employees become proficient in their jobs  and expanding our service offerings may require us to enter into new markets and encounter new competitive challenges 
we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth 
if we fail to overcome those risks  we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts  we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability 
competition for drivers is intense within the trucking industry  and we periodically experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified drivers 
our operations may be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future  which could cause us to temporarily under utilize our fleet  face difficulty in meeting shipper demands 
table of contents and increase our compensation levels for drivers 
if we encounter difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers  our ability to service our customers and increase our revenue could be adversely affected 
insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 
we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage  property damage  personal injury  workers compensation  long term disability and group health 
we carry significant insurance with third party insurance carriers  the cost of which has risen significantly in recent years 
to offset  in part  the significant increases we have experienced  we have elected to increase our self insured retention levels for most of our risk exposures 
if the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured increases  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in addition  insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our self insured retention 
if these requirements increase  our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 
our business is subject to general economic factors that are largely out of our control 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers business levels  the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for bad debt losses  which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt 
in addition  because we self insure a substantial portion of our group health expense  increases in healthcare costs and pharmaceutical expenses can adversely affect our financial results 
our results also may be negatively affected by increases in interest rates  which increase our borrowing costs and can negatively affect the level of economic activity by our customers and thus our freight volumes 
we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing 
our business is highly capital intensive 
our net capital expenditures  including the acquisition of business assets  in and were  and  respectively 
we expect our capital expenditures for to be approximately  to  the increase in our capital expenditures for is primarily due to planned real estate acquisitions and improvements to increase capacity at our existing service centers  which we believe are necessary in order for us to achieve our growth strategy 
we depend on operating leases  lines of credit  senior debt and cash flow from operations to finance our tractors  trailers and service centers 
if we are unable in the future to raise sufficient capital or borrow sufficient funds to make these purchases  we will be forced to limit our growth and operate our trucks for longer periods of time  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  our business has significant operating cash requirements 
if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods  we may need to seek additional financing  which may be costly or difficult to obtain 
we entered into a five year   senior unsecured revolving credit facility  dated august   with wachovia bank  national association serving as administrative agent for the lenders that we believe provides us with a sufficient source for borrowing as needed 
we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the price and availability of diesel fuel 
diesel fuel is a significant operating expense 
we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases 
any increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase  to the extent not offset by freight rate increases or fuel surcharges to customers  or any interruption in the supply of diesel fuel  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
historically  we have been able to offset significant increases in diesel fuel prices through fuel surcharges to our customers  but we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future 
from time to time  we may experience shortages in the availability of diesel fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules 

table of contents limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures 
we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply 
the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines 
see the risk factor below entitled we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  and costs of compliance with  liabilities under  or violations of  existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 
we operate in a highly regulated industry  and increased costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies 
these regulatory authorities have broad powers  generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations  safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers  driver hours of service and periodic financial reporting 
in addition  the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities  which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental  occupational safety and health regulations or limits on vehicle weight and size and ergonomics 
regulatory requirements  and changes in regulatory requirements  may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing transportation services 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  and costs of compliance with  liabilities under  or violations of  existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations regulating  among other things  the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or presence on or in our properties and vehicles  fuel storage tanks  our transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water 
under certain environmental laws  we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time  and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
the environmental protection agency has issued regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through beginning in october  new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits 
some of the regulations required reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june and the introduction of emissions after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles beginning with model year the majority of our new tractor purchases in are expected to have engines manufactured prior to without these devices  which is permitted under the new regulations 
these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased fuel and maintenance costs 
these adverse effects  combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles  could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and operations 
our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 
our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry 
our operating results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months 
harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight  which could result in increased operating expenses 
if we are unable to retain our key employees  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be harmed 
our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers 
in that regard  the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operation and cash flows

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading non union less than truckload ltl multi regional motor carrier providing one to five day service among five regions in the united states and next day and second day service within these regions 
historically  over of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers  whose demand for our services is generally tied to the overall health of the us domestic economy 
in analyzing the components of our revenue  we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics revenue per hundredweight this measurement reflects our pricing policies  which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth strategies 
generally  freight is rated by a class system  which is established by the national motor freight traffic association  inc light  bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per hundredweight than dense  heavy freight 
changes in the class  packaging of the freight and length of haul of the shipment can also affect this average 
fuel surcharges  accessorial charges and revenue adjustments  excluding adjustments for undelivered freight  are included in this measurement for all periods presented in this report 
revenue adjustments for undelivered freight are required for financial statement purposes in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy  however  we believe excluding these adjustments from this calculation results in a better indicator of changes in our pricing 
weight per shipment fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the class  or mix  of freight we receive from our customers as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment 
generally  increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand for our customers products and overall increased economic activity 
average length of haul we consider lengths of haul less than miles to be regional traffic  lengths of haul between miles and  miles to be inter regional traffic  and lengths of haul in excess of  miles to be national traffic 
by segmenting our revenue into lengths of haul  we can determine our market share and the growth potential of our service products in those markets 
revenue per shipment this measurement is primarily determined by the three metrics listed above and is used  in conjunction with the number of shipments we receive  to calculate total revenue  excluding adjustments for undelivered freight 
our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure  generally referred to as increasing density  thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity 
we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center  linehaul load factor  p d stops per hour  p d shipments per hour and platform pounds handled per hour 
we believe continued improvement in density is a key component in our ability to sustain profitable growth 
our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight  operating supplies and expenses  and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities 
we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio  a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue  which also allows industry wide comparisons with our competition 
we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs 
this technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our systems  while providing key metrics from which we can monitor our processes

average length of haul miles revenue per shipment in and for the third consecutive year  we produced revenue growth in excess of and growth in diluted earnings per share in excess of 
we maintained our revenue focus on increasing density  which resulted in producing over of our revenue from service centers open for more than one year and a increase in average revenue per service center 
the operating leverage we generated resulted in continued improvement in our operating ratio to  which is the first time we have operated below in our fifteen years as a public company and is our fifth consecutive year of improvement 

table of contents our revenue growth in was the result of an growth in shipments and a increase in revenue per shipment 
the increase in revenue per shipment consists of increases in both revenue per hundredweight and weight per shipment of and  respectively  from the combination of increases in shipments and weight per shipment produced tonnage growth over we believe our growth  particularly in existing markets  is attributable to our ability to offer a one source solution for shippers regional and inter regional needs by providing these services through one company  in contrast to many of our principal competitors 
additionally  the expansion of our geographic footprint  as well as increased full state coverage  has positioned us to be attractive to more and more shippers 
while most of our revenue growth is derived from service centers open for more than one year  the expansion of our service center network and improvement in our service capabilities should provide a platform for future growth 
we increased the total number of service centers in our network to at december  from at december  revenue growth from geographic expansion typically results in additional freight moving through our existing service center network  which helps to offset higher operating margins that typically accompany new service center openings 
seven of the service centers opened in were spin offs of existing service centers to improve service and create additional capacity for growth 
due to the established customer base and operating presence in those markets  we were able to operate those spin offs profitably within a shorter period of time than traditional openings in new geographic territories 
revenue per hundredweight increased to from in this pricing improvement reflects the general rate increase on our base rates and minimum charges for certain tariffs  effective april   and occurred despite the increase in weight per shipment  which generally has the effect of reducing revenue per hundredweight 
this pricing improvement demonstrates a stable economy and pricing environment throughout most of and our ability to maintain pricing discipline while increasing the volume of freight moving through our service center network 
we experienced a decline in the fourth quarter of in weight per shipment and a slowdown in our tonnage growth  which are consistent with market indicators of a slowing economy and the reported results of others in our industry 
if these trends continue  pricing pressures could become more prevalent in the marketplace and our growth in revenue and net income could slow in comparison to the historical annual growth rates 
however  we believe that we can maintain operational efficiencies to continue our trend of comparable quarter improvement in our operating ratio even in a period of slower growth 
our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels that are generally indexed to the us department of energy s published fuel prices  which is consistent with industry practice 
this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and was implemented to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel  which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses 
because of the sustained increase in diesel fuel costs and other petroleum based products  our freight pricing strategy  as well as that in the ltl industry  has evolved and the fuel surcharge is one of many components in the overall price for our transportation services 
as a result  the fuel surcharge often represents more than just the pass through of increased diesel fuel cost 
because of average higher diesel fuel prices in and the evolution of our freight pricing strategy  the fuel surcharge increased to of revenue from in a rapid and significant decrease in diesel fuel prices would likely reduce our revenue and operating income until we revised our pricing strategy to reflect these changes 
much of the overall improvement in our operating ratio was achieved by the improvement in salaries  wages and benefits as a percent of revenue  which decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this improvement primarily resulted from a decrease in benefit costs to of revenue from in workers compensation expenses decreased  as a percent of revenue  from  as a result of favorable claims experience and a favorable adjustment to our reserve for unpaid claims following an independent actuarial review conducted in the fourth quarter of these improvements were somewhat offset by a increase  as a percent of revenue  in benefit costs resulting from enhancements to our vacation policy and additional costs to provide group health benefits to our employees 

table of contents in addition to the improvement in benefit costs  our salary and clerical wages decreased by of revenue from as we leveraged our revenue growth over this segment of our workforce 
p d driver wages decreased by of revenue from  which can be attributed to a improvement in our p d stops per hour 
we benefited from the additional density caused by growth in tonnage  the efficiencies in our route planning through the use of our p d route optimization software and the use of our driver handheld computers 
platform wages also decreased by of revenue from  primarily due to a increase in platform pounds handled per hour 
operating supplies and expenses increased to of revenue in from in this increase was primarily due to a increase in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  resulting from increased diesel fuel prices and a increase in consumption 
the consumption increase resulted in an increase in our fuel taxes  which primarily accounts for the change in our operating taxes and licenses 
we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments  therefore  we are subject to market price fluctuations 
our fuel surcharge revenue more than offset our increased cost of diesel fuel in we made significant investments in revenue equipment and real estate in and to support our growth and to prevent our fleet and service center network from becoming a limiting factor to our growth 
as a result  depreciation and amortization remained consistent at of revenue in and in addition  building and office equipment rents also remained consistent at of revenue in and we purchase transportation services from other motor carriers and railroads for linehaul and p d services 
we also contract with lease operators for our container operations and incur short term rentals for tractors  trailers and other revenue producing equipment 
we primarily utilize these services when there are capacity restraints or imbalances of freight flow within our service center network or when it is economically beneficial 
purchased transportation increased slightly to of revenue in from in the increase is primarily due to the increased use of purchased linehaul services beginning in the second quarter of  which became necessary in certain lanes because of our significant growth 
we were able to add a sufficient number of drivers in the third quarter of  which allowed us to utilize our own equipment and decrease the use of purchased linehaul services 
as a result  purchased linehaul services have returned to historical levels and represent an opportunity for additional operating leverage that may be obtained with the continued expansion of our network 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased to  for from  for this increase is primarily due to an increased average balance outstanding on our long term debt resulting from the two separate issuances of privately placed senior notes under the note purchase agreement entered into on april   offset by the  of interest income earned on cash equivalents and short term investments 
the effective average tax equivalent yield  excluding the state tax benefit  on our short term investments was for our effective tax rate for was compared to in the decrease in our effective tax rate is due primarily to the tax exempt interest income earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments in due to our cash needs in to fund capital expenditures  we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in our effective tax rate exceeds the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of state taxes and  to a lesser extent  certain non deductible items

average length of haul miles revenue per shipment the growth in revenue we produced in was a primary driver of our financial performance for that year 
for the first time in our history  we achieved revenue over billion while extending a four year trend of producing double digit growth in revenue  net income and diluted earnings per share 
our profitability was due primarily to our focus on growth in existing markets  thereby leveraging our existing infrastructure and capacity 
as a result  we lowered our operating ratio to  increased net income by and increased diluted earnings per share by 
our revenue growth in was generated through an growth in tonnage and an increase in revenue per hundredweight 
the tonnage growth consists of increases in both shipments and weight per shipment of and  respectively  from we have achieved this growth primarily through expanding our business with existing customers and adding new customers in existing areas  as well as launching new services and improving the quality of our service 
we believe that our continued geographic expansion  as well as increased full state coverage  has positioned us to be attractive to more and more shippers 
additionally  we are able to offer a one source solution to customers regional and inter regional shipping needs by providing these services through one company  in contrast to many of our principal competitors 
for these reasons  combined with a stable economy and industry consolidation during  we continued to gain market share and increase our revenues 
our average length of haul decreased from in to miles in  reflecting higher growth in our shorter haul regional lanes 
the growth in these shorter haul lanes can be attributed to our evolving customer base  our growing number of states with full state coverage and our focus on building our presence in regional markets 
we believe that our competitiveness in the next day and two day lanes presents us with further growth opportunities  as these are the fastest growing markets in the industry due to the changing demands of shippers

table of contents our pricing has remained relatively stable despite the increased weight per shipment and decreased length of haul  which generally have the effect of reducing revenue per hundredweight 
the overall stability in our pricing demonstrates our ability to maintain our pricing discipline while increasing the volume of freight moving through our service center network 
we increased the total number of service centers in our network to at december  from at december  the expansion of our service center network and improvement in our service capabilities should provide a platform for future growth 
however  the majority of our revenue growth for the years compared was generated from our existing service center network  which contributed to a increase in revenue per service center in and the continued improvement in our operating ratio 
the revenue growth from geographic expansion typically results in additional freight moving through our existing service center network  which helps to offset higher operating margins that typically accompany new service center openings 
much of the overall improvement in our operating ratio was achieved by the improvement in salaries  wages and benefits as a percent of revenue  which decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in driver wages decreased to of revenue from of revenue in we saw continued improvement in our linehaul load averages and p d productivity in  as reflected by our improvement in revenue per linehaul mile and our improvement in p d shipments handled per hour from we also experienced a similar improvement in platform labor  which decreased to of revenue in from in this improvement primarily resulted from a increase in platform pounds handled per hour 
fringe benefit costs increased to of payroll from in  primarily due to increases in workers compensation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of we engaged an independent actuary to review our workers compensation and group health self insurance accruals in  which resulted in million of additional expense in our fringe benefit costs 
operating supplies and expenses increased to of revenue in from in this increase was primarily due to a increase in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  resulting from increased diesel fuel prices and a increase in consumption 
we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments  therefore  we are subject to market price fluctuations 
our fuel surcharges  which are generally indexed to the us department of energy s published fuel prices  more than offset the increases in diesel fuel prices during insurance and claims expense  primarily consisting of premiums and self insured costs for auto liability and cargo claims  decreased to of revenue in compared to in we choose to self insure a portion of our auto and cargo claims liabilities and obtain excess insurance coverage for claims above our retention levels 
the improvement in is primarily a result of a reduction in our auto liability expense in the fourth quarter of as a result of an independent actuarial review of our self insured reserve for unpaid claims 
cargo claims expense also decreased slightly in  which we attribute to the increased utilization of adjustable rack systems and reusable inflatable air bags in our trailer fleet  which protect freight from damage caused by load shifting 
new trailer purchases are equipped with these adjustable rack systems and we have retrofitted a portion of our existing trailer fleet 
the significant growth we experienced in required continued investment in real estate and equipment 
additionally  we completed several expansion projects to existing service centers to ensure that our service center network is not a limiting factor to our growth 
as a result  depreciation and amortization decreased only slightly to of revenue in from in in addition  building and office equipment rents remained consistent at of revenue for both and we purchase transportation services from other motor carriers and railroads for linehaul and p d services 
we also contract with lease operators for our container operations and incur short term leases for tractors  trailers and other revenue producing equipment 
we utilize these services when there are capacity restraints or imbalances of freight flow within our service center network or when it is economically beneficial 
purchased transportation decreased to of revenue in from in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the use of purchased linehaul services  which is due to the increased use of our personnel and equipment 

table of contents our continued revenue growth and density improvements in allowed us to successfully leverage our communication and utilities costs along with general supplies and expenses  which when combined  decreased to of revenue in from in interest expense  net of interest income  increased to  for from  for this increase is primarily due to an increased average balance of our long term debt resulting from the two separate issuances of privately placed senior notes under the note purchase agreement entered into on february  our effective tax rate for was compared to in the effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of state taxes and  to a lesser extent  certain non deductible items 
liquidity and capital resources we have three primary sources of available liquidity to fund our estimated capital expenditures cash flows from operations  short term investments and available borrowings under the five year   senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated credit agreement  dated august   with wachovia bank  national association serving as the administrative agent for the lenders the credit agreement 
we also have the ability to issue senior notes to provide another source of liquidity  if needed 
expansion in both the size and number of service center facilities  our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth have required continued investment in real estate and equipment 
in order to support these requirements  we incurred net capital expenditures in of  including the capital assets obtained as part of the acquisition of business assets  during cash flows from operations funded approximately of these expenditures 
at december   long term debt  including current maturities  increased to  from  at december   primarily due to the proceeds received from the privately placed senior notes issued under the note purchase agreement entered into on april  we entered into this note purchase agreement to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes  including  but not limited to  our estimated net capital expenditures not funded by operating cash flows 
the remaining net proceeds from this transaction are included in short term investments 
we estimate capital expenditures  net of anticipated proceeds from dispositions  to be approximately  to  for the year ending december  of our gross capital expenditures  approximately  is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers   is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities  construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities  and  is allocated for investments in technology 
the increase in our estimated capital expenditures for compared to is primarily due to planned real estate acquisitions and improvements to increase capacity at our existing service centers  which we believe is necessary in order for us to achieve our growth objectives 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations and the liquidation of our short term investments 
the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment  including those obtained as part of the acquisition of business assets  for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands land and structures tractors trailers technology other proceeds from sale total 
table of contents the credit agreement  as discussed above  amended and restated the terms of the existing  senior unsecured revolving credit facility dated september   as amended 
of the  line of credit commitments   may be used for letters of credit and  may be used for borrowings under wachovia s sweep program 
the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of  or initiates overnight investments for excess cash balances 
in addition  we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of  in minimum increments of  at our option  revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a the higher of wachovia bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus per annum the base rate  b libor one  two  three or six months plus an applicable margin the adjusted libor rate  or c one month libor plus an applicable margin the libor index rate 
the applicable margin is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from to 
the applicable margin was for the period this credit agreement was in effect during revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants  including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
any future wholly owned subsidiaries of the company would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility 
at december   there was no outstanding balance on the line of credit facility and there was  of outstanding letters of credit 
commitment fees ranging from to are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement 
letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter 
the commitment fees and letter of credit fees were and  respectively  for the period the credit agreement was in effect during in addition  a facing fee at an annual rate of is charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 
we have four unsecured senior note agreements outstanding totaling  at december  these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities ranging from to  of which  is due in the next twelve months 
interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from to 
the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was and at december  and  respectively 
included in our senior notes is  of notes under a note purchase agreement entered into on april  on april   we issued  of privately placed series a senior notes  tranche a and on june  issued an additional  of privately placed series a senior notes  tranche b collectively  the series a notes pursuant to the terms of this note purchase agreement 
the series a notes are unsecured and bear an annual interest rate of from the date of issuance and mature on april  the series a notes call for semi annual interest payments beginning on october  and seven equal annual principal prepayments commencing on april  the proceeds from this agreement were used to refinance existing indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement and the company expects to use the remaining proceeds for planned capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes 
the note purchase agreement may also serve as the platform for potential future private note issuances by the company 
the aggregate principal amount of all notes issued pursuant to the note purchase agreement  including the series a notes  shall not exceed  the applicable interest rate and payment schedules for any new notes will be determined and mutually agreed upon at the time of issuance 
with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement  if any  interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments 
therefore  short term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility 
we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
also  we do not use fuel hedging instruments  as our tariff provisions and contracts generally allow for fuel surcharges to be implemented in the event that fuel prices exceed stipulated levels 

table of contents our senior notes and credit agreement limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to shareholders pursuant to certain financial ratios 
our credit agreement  which was the most restrictive at december   limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i  ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year  or iii an amount equal to of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year 
we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in or a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability 
most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance  which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules 
we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance  and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet seasonal and long term capital needs 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations  exclusive of interest capital lease obligations  exclusive of interest operating leases obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations include long term debt consisting primarily of senior notes totaling  capital lease obligations for computer equipment  operating leases primarily consisting of real estate leases  and purchase obligations consists of non cancelable purchase orders for equipment scheduled for delivery in please refer to the information regarding interest rates in this section above and also in note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these critical accounting policies are further described in note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract  our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers 
generally  this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment 
for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period  we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period 
under this method  we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment s standard delivery time schedule 
this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 
allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables  our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers 
actual write offs could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of several factors including changes in the overall economic environment 
table of contents or factors and risks surrounding our customers 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments 
we continually review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts so as to reflect the most recent trends and factors 
we also maintain an allowance for revenue adjustments resulting from billing corrections  customer allowances  money back service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments 
these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations 
we use historical experience  trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 
management believes the methodologies for estimating these allowances to be reliable based on the accuracy of our estimates in prior periods 
as such  we do not anticipate any near term changes in our methodologies for these estimates 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated undiscounted cost of claims for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health not covered by insurance 
the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers compensation  long term disability and group health  which are charged to employee benefits expense 
insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors 
as a result  we periodically evaluate our self insured retention levels to determine the most cost efficient balance between self insurance and excess coverage 
in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical claims development experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable  however  changes in the severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
management uses historical experience  certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset 
periodically  we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions  and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 
currently  estimated economic lives for structures are to years  revenue equipment is to years  other equipment is to years  and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 
inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation  which generally results in increased operating costs 
in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products  particularly diesel fuel  we have implemented a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements 
the fuel surcharge was implemented to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base  which is generally indexed to the us department of energy s published fuel prices 
for the past three years  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations
