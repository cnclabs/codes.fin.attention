net sales in the pickle segment decreased to million for from million in the prior year primarily due to declines in sales to retail customers 
net sales of other products increased to million in from million in the prior year primarily due to increased sales of refrigerated and aseptic products 
price increases were announced late in the fourth quarter of for all segments of the business in an effort to offset rising energy and raw material costs

cost of sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased to in from in the prior year 
we experienced increased raw material and packaging costs that we were unable to fully pass on to our customers 
higher fuel and energy costs increased significantly in the third and fourth quarter of largely as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
we also continued to experience increases in certain commodity costs such as casein and coconut oil compared to the prior year 
see results by segment 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to million in compared to million for the increase in resulted from four events the creation of treehouse and hiring of its management team costs associated with the spin off of treehouse from dean foods the adoption of statement of accounting standard sfas no 
r share based payment in the third quarter  which increased operating expenses by million  and the closing of our la junta  colorado pickle plant 
selling and distribution expenses decreased million primarily due to a reduction of sales and marketing personnel in the fourth quarter of and lower trade marketing expenses 
these decreases were offset somewhat by higher fuel prices  which we estimate added a total of approximately million to distribution costs in compared to treehouse corporate costs of million  including million related to share based compensation under sfas r  are included in general and administrative expense 
the transaction costs to complete the spin off are included in other operating expense in the amount of million 
these costs  which include legal  accounting and other professional fees and an investment banking fee incurred in completing the spin off  are considered by treehouse to be a one time expense unique to this transaction 
we also announced the closing of our la junta  colorado pickle plant in the fourth quarter of to reduce pickle manufacturing capacity and recorded closing expenses of million  which are included in other operating expenses 
expenses associated with this closing include property and equipment 
table of contents impairments  employee severance  and lease termination expenses 
in addition  we recorded impairment expenses of million related to certain trademarks and other intangibles 
other operating expense also includes three items which partially offset the increased expenses above 
we received million in the second quarter and million in the fourth quarter as a settlement for participating in a high fructose corn syrup class action antitrust litigation 
we also sold our cairo  georgia facilities and a tank yard facility in the second quarter that generated gains of million and million  respectively

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historical cash flow we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations 
when we were part of dean foods  our cash was swept regularly by dean foods 
dean foods also funded our operating and investing activities as needed 
our transfers of cash both to and from dean foods cash management system are reflected on our balance sheets as dean foods net investment 
dean foods did not allocate the interest expense related to its receivables backed facility or other financing obligations to its segments  except for specific borrowings for industrial revenue bonds 
therefore  the interest expense reflected in our consolidated financial statements relates to capital leases  senior notes and the line of credit for those periods 
year ended december in thousands cash provided by operating activities capital spending net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to due to an increase in net income plus non cash items of million an increase in working capital of million in due primarily to the post acquisition increase in working capital of the soup and infant feeding business  compared to a decrease in working capital of million in  and a decrease in cash provided by discontinued operations of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in  an increase of million due to the acquisition of the soup and infant feeding business and the oxford book of business 
we received million as the result of stock option exercises in compared to million in and paid million in financing costs related to our million revolving line of credit and million issuance of senior notes 
current debt obligations at december  we had million in borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  senior notes of million and million consisting of capital leases and other obligations 
our short term financing needs primarily are for financing working capital during the year 
due to the seasonality of pickle production driven by the cucumber harvest cycle  which occurs primarily during the spring and summer  pickle inventories generally are at a low point in late spring and at a high point during the fall increasing our working capital requirement 
in addition  we build inventories of soup in the summer months in anticipation of large seasonal shipments that begin late in the third quarter 
our long term financing needs will depend largely on potential acquisition activity 
at december   we had million in borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
in addition  at december   there were million of letters of credit under the revolver that were issued but undrawn 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreements 
our credit agreement  plus cash flow from operations  is expected to be adequate to provide liquidity for our planned growth strategy

table of contents the table below summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments as of december  payments due by period less than more than indebtedness  purchase lease obligations total year years years years in thousands revolving credit facility senior notes capital lease obligations purchasing obligations operating leases total revolving credit facility obligation includes principal of million and interest at an average rate of at december  senior note obligation includes principal and interest payments based on fixed interest note of 
principal payment is due september  see note for details 
payments required under long term capitalized lease contracts 
primarily represents commitments to purchase minimum quantities of raw materials used in our production processes  primarily cucumbers 
we enter into these contracts from time to time in an effort to ensure a sufficient supply of raw ingredients 
in addition  we have contractual obligations to purchase various services that are part of our production process 
in accordance with gaap  these obligations are not reflected in the accompanying balance sheets 
operating lease obligations consist of minimum rental payments under non cancelable operating leases 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement  other than operating leases  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
long term liabilities certain employees participate in retirement plans and postretirement plans 
these plans offer pension benefits through various defined benefit pension plans and also offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees 
reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors  assumptions and estimates 
for example  these costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plan and earnings on plan assets 
our pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
changes made to the provisions of the plan may impact current and future pension costs 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
pension costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants 
we contributed million to the pension plans and approximately million to the postretirement health plans in revolving credit facility on august   we entered into amendment no 
to our unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement  dated june   with a group of participating financial institutions 
among other things  amendment no 
extends the termination date of the credit 
table of contents agreement to august   increases the aggregate commitment amount of the credit agreement to million and amends certain definitions and rates which result in reductions in interest and various fees payable to the lenders under the credit agreement 
this agreement also includes a million letter of credit sublimit  against which million in letters of credit have been issued  but undrawn 
proceeds from the credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  including acquisition financing 
the credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios  including a leverage and interest coverage ratio 
we are in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december  we believe that  given our current cash position  our cash flow from operating activities and our available credit capacity  we can comply with the current terms of the credit facility and meet foreseeable financial requirements 
on september   we completed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due september  pursuant to a note purchase agreement among treehouse and a group of purchasers 
all of the company s obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by bay valley foods  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the senior notes have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended  and may not be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption 
net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit agreement 
other commitments and contingencies we also have the following commitments and contingent liabilities  in addition to contingent liabilities related to ordinary course litigation  investigations and tax audits certain lease obligations  and selected levels of property and casualty risks  primarily related to employee health care  workers compensation claims and other casualty losses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our commitments and contingent obligations 
future capital requirements capital expenditures were million in compared to million in we expect capital spending programs to increase in as a result of including a full twelve months of the soup and infant feeding segment 
capital spending in will focus on plant efficiencies and upgrades to our pittsburgh plant s water and power systems 
known trends and uncertainties prices of raw materials we were adversely affected by rising input costs during and  and we expect our financial results to continue to be adversely affected by high input costs throughout many of the raw materials used in our products rose to unusually high levels during  including processed vegetables and meats  soybean oil  casein  cheese and packaging materials 
fluctuating fuel costs are also impacting our results 
prices for many of these raw materials and packaging materials are expected to remain high 
for competitive reasons  we may not be able to pass along increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them 
competitive environment there has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery and foodservice industries in recent years  and mass merchandisers are gaining market share 
as our customer base continues to consolidate  we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer  large customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers  or gain new customers 
as the consolidation of the retail 
table of contents grocery and foodservice industries continues  we could lose sales if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold 
both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment at the retail and foodservice levels have caused competition to become increasingly intense in our business 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment 
in certain circumstances  however  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
we have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies 
accounts receivable we provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to days  perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses 
as these factors change  our estimates change and we could accrue different amounts for doubtful accounts in different accounting periods 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was  or approximately of the accounts receivable balance 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  expressed as a percent of accounts receivable  was approximately at december  each change in the ratio of allowance for doubtful accounts to accounts receivable would impact bad debt expense by approximately  we also maintain an allowance for customer promotional programs  marketing co op programs and other sales and marketing expenses 
this allowance is based on historical rolling twelve month average program activity and can fluctuate due to the level of sales and marketing programs 
this allowance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets our goodwill and intangible assets totaled million as of december  resulting primarily from acquisitions 
upon acquisition  the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities  including trademarks and customer related intangible assets  with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized 
we believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
if these perpetual trademark criteria are not met  the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives 
determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors including the competitive environment  market share  trademark history and anticipated future trademark support 
indefinite lived trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if other events occur  to ensure that fair value continues to exceed the related book value 
an indefinite lived trademark is impaired if its book value exceeds fair value 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
a reporting unit can be a segment or an operating division 
if the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value  the asset is written down to fair value  which is generally based on its discounted future cash flows 
future business results could impact the evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets 
amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating environment 
if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value  which is generally based on discounted future cash flows 

table of contents considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
we recognized impairment expenses for trademarks and other intangibles of and million for years ending december  and  respectively 
we did not recognize any impairment charges during purchase price allocation we allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
all identifiable assets acquired  including identifiable intangibles  and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired company  normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
we record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements 
as final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined  appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation 
to the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair values of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations  such difference would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill 
the final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed including quoted market prices  forecast of expected cash flows  net realizable values  estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives 
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period  which could have an impact on our earnings 
future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
stock based compensation for the quarter beginning july   we adopted the requirements of sfas r share based payments 
the company elected to use the modified prospective application of sfas r for these awards issued prior to july  income from continuing operations before tax for the years ended december  and december  included share based compensation expense for employee and director stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units of million and million  respectively 
the lower amount of expense in was due to having only six months of stock based compensation expense 
the fair value of each stock option  restricted stock and restricted stock unit award the awards is estimated on the date of grant using the assumptions noted in the following table and the market price of the company s stock on the date of grant 
the stock options were valued using a black scholes model and the restricted stock and restricted stock units were valued using a monte carlo simulation 
because valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs  those ranges are disclosed 
share based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under sfas no 
r  could have been impacted if other assumptions were used 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be impacted in future periods 
we use an independent third party to assist in determining these assumptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
as the company s stock was not publicly traded prior to june   expected volatilities are based on the implied historical volatilities from peer companies and other factors 
the company has estimated that all employees will complete the required service conditions associated with the restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards 
the expected service period is the longer of the derived service period  as determined from the output of the valuation models  and the implied service period based on the term of the awards 
the risk free interest 
table of contents rate for periods within the contractual life of the awards is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
the company did not make any restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards in the assumptions used to calculate the option awards granted in and the restricted stock unit awards in are presented below 
stock options restricted stock restricted stock units expected volatility expected dividends expected term years years years risk free interest rate insurance accruals we retain selected levels of property and casualty risks  primarily related to employee health care  workers compensation claims and other casualty losses 
many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits 
in other areas  we are self insured with stop loss coverage 
accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate a number of variables including claims history and expected trends 
these loss development factors are based on industry factors and  along with the estimated liabilities  are developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries 
at december  and  we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of million and million  respectively  including both current and long term liabilities 
changes in loss development factors  claims history and cost trends could result in substantially different results in the future 
employee benefit plan costs we provide a range of benefits to our employees including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles  which include various actuarial assumptions  such as discount rates  assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
different assumptions that we make could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
in we retained investment consultants to assist our investment committee with the transition of plan assets to a master trust and to help our investment committee formulate a long term investment policy for the newly established master trust 
our current asset mix guidelines under the investment policy target equities at to of the portfolio and fixed income at to 
at december   our master trust was invested as follows equity securities of  fixed income securities of  and cash and cash equivalents of 
we determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plan s investments based on target allocations of the pension plan s investments 
additionally  we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model that was developed by the plan s investment consultants and historical returns on comparable equity  debt and other investments 
the resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is while a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature  including assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and mortality rates  generally accepted accounting principles require that our discount rate assumption be more heavily weighted to current market conditions 
as such  our discount rate will likely change more frequently 
we used a discount rate to determine our estimated future benefit obligations of at december  a reduction in the assumed rate of return on plan assets or a reduction in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by less than  in either case 
in addition  a increase in assumed healthcare costs trends would increase the aggregate annual postretirement medical expense by approximately 
table of contents recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is provided in note to the company s condensed consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations in july  we entered into a forward interest rate swap transaction for a notational amount of million as a hedge of the forecasted private placement of million senior notes 
the interest rate swap transaction was terminated on august   which resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
the unamortized loss is reflected  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
the total loss will be reclassified ratably to our statements of income as an increase to interest expense over the term of the senior notes  providing an effective interest rate of over the terms of our senior notes 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes or hold any derivative financial instruments as of december   which could expose us to significant market risk 
in addition  all of our foreign sales are transacted in us dollars 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase in the amount of interest expense we expect to pay with respect to our revolving credit facility  which is tied to variable market rates 
based on our outstanding debt balance under our revolving credit facility  as of december   each rise in our interest rate would increase our interest expense by approximately million annually 
input cost the costs of other raw materials  as well as packaging materials and fuel have varied widely in recent years and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly 
many of the raw materials that we use in our products rose to unusually high levels during  including processed vegetables and meats  soybean oil  casein  cheese and packaging materials 
in addition  fuel costs  which represent the most important factor affecting utility costs at our production facilities and our transportation costs  are currently at very high levels 
furthermore  certain input requirements  such as glass used in packaging  are available only from a limited number of suppliers 
the most important raw material used in our pickle operations is cucumbers 
we purchase cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers strategically located to supply our production facilities 
bad weather or disease in a particular growing area can damage or destroy the crop in that area  which would impair crop yields 
if we are not able to buy cucumbers from local suppliers  we would likely either purchase cucumbers from foreign sources  such as mexico or india  or ship cucumbers from other growing areas in the united states  thereby increasing our production costs 
changes in the prices of our products may lag behind changes in the costs of our materials 
competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to increased raw materials  packaging and fuel costs 
accordingly  if we are unable to increase our prices to offset increase raw material  packaging and fuel costs  our operating profits and margins could be materially adversely affected
