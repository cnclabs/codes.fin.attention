item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical financial data and our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
overview our business 
we were formed in july we are a growing independent exploration company engaged in the discovery and production of oil and natural gas in the outer continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
as of december   we owned interests in net to us producing oil and natural gas wells in the federal and state waters of the gulf of mexico 
we operate of the producing wells that we own 
in managing our business  we are concerned primarily with maximizing return on our stockholders equity 
to accomplish this primary goal  we focus on profitably increasing our oil and natural gas reserves 
see risk factors for a description of risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry and our business  any one of which  if it occurs  can negatively impact our ability to accomplish our primary goal 
our future growth will be driven primarily by exploration activities 
we have identified exploration prospects in our inventory that are located on our leasehold acreage and supported by d seismic data 
we believe that by adhering to our prospect selection methodology  we have realized high historical exploration success rates 
we believe that our inventory  including development wells resulting from new discoveries  will provide us with opportunities to increase our reserves over the next three to five years 
under our current drilling budget  we plan to drill approximately ten of these prospects in however  the actual number of prospects that we drill over any defined time period will be determined based upon the number of rig days that we have available under our contracts with drilling contractors and the amount of time it takes to drill 
table of contents each prospect selected by our management and technical team 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting which allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration activities 
accordingly  our exploration costs consist of costs we incur to acquire and reprocess d seismic data  impairments of our unevaluated leasehold where we were not successful in discovering reserves and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells that we drill 
we generally sell our oil and natural gas at current market prices at the point our platforms connect to third party purchaser pipelines 
we market our products several different ways depending upon a number of factors  including the availability of purchasers for the product  the availability and cost of pipelines near the related production platform  market prices  pipeline constraints and operational flexibility 
accordingly  our revenues are heavily dependent upon the prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
we have not entered into oil and natural gas hedging arrangements on any of our anticipated sales 
however  we may in the future enter into such arrangements in order to reduce our exposure to price risks 
such arrangements may also limit our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices 
our operating costs include the expense of operating our wells  platforms and other infrastructure in the gulf of mexico and transporting our products to the point of sale 
our operating costs are generally comprised of several components  including costs of field personnel  repair and maintenance cost  production supplies  fuel used in operations  transportation cost  workover cost and production and ad valorem taxes for properties located in state waters 
like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  we face the challenge of replacing our reserves 
oil and natural gas properties in the gulf of mexico typically deplete at higher rates than do properties in other areas of the united states 
although in the past we have offset the effect of sharply declining production rates from existing properties through successful drilling efforts  there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset production declines or maintain production at our current rates through additional discoveries 
we intend to continue our focus on adding reserves through drilling efforts  and our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add new reserves in excess of production 
our exploration and production activities are conducted in the gulf of mexico 
our operations are significantly impacted by conditions in the gulf of mexico  such as adverse weather conditions  the availability of equipment  facilities or services  delays and decreases in the availability of capacity to transport  gather or process production  and changes in the regulatory environment 
we maintain insurance to mitigate the risk of damage to our production facilities that could result from adverse weather conditions 
we have periodically shut in our production as a result of hurricanes or tropical storm activity 
as a result of hurricane activity  we deferred production of approximately bcfe in  bcfe in and bcfe in we also had drilling rigs under contract standing idle during the storm activity for a combined total of and days in and  respectively 
we incurred approximately million  million and million in costs to repair damage to our facilities caused by the hurricane activity in  and  respectively 
our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and natural gas  and operational safety 
future laws or regulations  any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
applicable environmental regulations require us to remove our platforms after production has ceased  to plug and abandon our wells and to remediate any environmental damage our operations may have caused 
the present value of the estimated future costs to plug and 
table of contents abandon our oil and gas wells and to dismantle and remove our production facilities is included in our reserve for future abandonment costs  which was million as of december  our predecessors 
in december  comstock offshore  llc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of comstock  acquired from bois d arc resources and other interest owners certain offshore oil and natural gas properties  including the properties we now own at ship shoal blocks   and and south pelto block bois d arc resources was the predecessor to bois d arc resources  ltd  an entity owned by two of our executive officers  directors and stockholders  gary w 
blackie and wayne l 
laufer 
in connection with this acquisition  comstock offshore  bois d arc resources  ltd 
and bois d arc offshore  ltd  another entity owned by messrs 
blackie and laufer  established a joint venture to explore for oil and natural gas in the gulf of mexico 
under the joint exploration venture  bois d arc was responsible for developing a budget for exploration activities and for generating exploration prospects in the gulf of mexico utilizing d seismic data and their extensive geological expertise in the region 
comstock offshore had to approve the budget and would advance the funds for the acquisition of d seismic data and leases needed to conduct exploration activities 
comstock offshore was reimbursed for all advanced costs and was entitled to a non promoted working interest in each prospect generated 
for each successful discovery well drilled pursuant to the joint exploration venture  comstock issued to the two principals of bois d arc warrants exercisable for the purchase of shares of comstock s common stock 
successful wells drilled under the exploration venture were operated by bois d arc offshore  ltd 
pursuant to a joint operating agreement entered into by the parties participating in the prospect  including comstock offshore and the bois d arc participants 
any future operation on the lease including drilling additional wells on the acreage associated with the prospect was conducted under the joint operating agreement and had to be approved by the participating parties 
our formation 
in july  comstock  bois d arc resources  ltd 
and messrs 
blackie and laufer formed our company to replace the joint exploration venture 
bois d arc resources  ltd  bois d arc offshore  ltd  and the other entities owned by messrs 
blackie and laufer and who we collectively refer to as bois d arc  and certain participants in their exploration activities  who we collectively refer to as the bois d arc participants  and comstock offshore contributed to bois d arc energy  llc substantially all of their gulf of mexico properties which properties are identified in properties primary operating areas and assigned to bois d arc energy  llc their related liabilities  including certain debt  in exchange for equity interests in bois d arc energy  llc 
the equity interests issued in exchange for the contributions were determined by using a valuation of the properties contributed by the particular contributors conducted by lee keeling and associates  inc  independent petroleum consultants  relative to the value of the properties contributed by all contributors 
comstock offshore contributed its gulf of mexico properties and assigned million of related debt in exchange for an approximately ownership interest 
each of the bois d arc participants contributed its interest in commonly owned gulf of mexico properties and they assigned in the aggregate million of related liabilities in exchange for an approximately aggregate ownership interest 
the bois d arc participants also received million in cash to equalize the amount that comstock offshore s debt exceeded its proportional share of the liabilities assigned 
of such amount  million was paid to mr 
blackie or entities controlled by him  million was paid to mr 
laufer or entities controlled by him  million was paid to d 
michael harris  one of our outside directors  and million was paid to john l 
duvieilh  another one of our outside directors 
we also reimbursed comstock offshore million and bois d arc million for advances made under the joint exploration venture for undrilled prospects 
comparability of results 
the combined financial statements included in this report and the discussion below with respect to periods prior to july  are based on the financial condition and results of operations of comstock offshore and the bois d arc participants as they relate to the properties contributed to us on a combined basis 
our predecessors  the bois d arc participants and comstock offshore  operated as joint venture partners from until our formation in july bois d arc energy  
table of contents llc prior to its conversion to a corporation was a continuation of this joint venture and formalized the relationship of the predecessors 
a majority of the interests of our predecessors were in the same properties and the operations were under the combined management of the predecessors 
as such  combined financial statements using historical cost basis properly reflect the historical combined operations of comstock offshore and the bois d arc participants 
in connection with our initial public offering in may  we converted from a limited liability company to a corporation 
the accompanying combined financial statements of the bois d arc energy predecessors present the combined results of operations  cash flows and changes in equity for the period from january  to july  of comstock offshore and the bois d arc participants for the properties contributed to the company 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidated results of the company  including its financial position as of december  and and its results of operations and cash flows for the period from inception through december  and for the years ended december   and the general and administrative expenses included in our predecessors combined financial statements reflect the general and administrative expenses of bois d arc  a privately held company  and certain general and administrative expenses allocated to comstock offshore by its parent  comstock 
as such  our general and administrative expenses are significantly different than those of our predecessors 
our predecessors were either individuals or partnerships or limited liability companies that passed through their taxable income to their owners 
accordingly  no provision for federal or state corporate income taxes was made in our predecessors combined financial statements 
as a result of our conversion to a corporation in may  our earnings are subject to federal  state and local taxes at a combined rate of approximately 
results of operations our operating data for the period from january  to july   the period from our inception on july  to december  and for the years ended december  and is summarized below combined bois d arc bois d arc energy predecessors energy period from period from combined bois d arc energy january  inception year ended year ended year ended to july  july  to december  december  december  december  in thousands  except per unit amounts revenues oil and gas sales expenses oil and gas operating exploration depreciation  depletion and amortization net production data oil mbbls natural gas mmcf natural gas equivalent mmcfe average sales price oil bbl natural gas mcf average equivalent price mcfe expenses per mcfe oil and gas operating depreciation  depletion and amortization includes lease operating costs and production and ad valorem taxes

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas sales 
our oil and gas sales increased million  or  in to million from million in the increase in sales resulted from a increase in our production  which was partially offset by lower natural gas prices in our average realized gas price decreased by and our average realized oil price increased by in as compared with the average prices we realized in on an equivalent unit basis  the average price received for our production in was per mcfe  which was lower than our average price received in of per mcfe 
our natural gas production increased by while our oil production increased by 
the oil and natural gas production increase was primarily related to new discoveries that we made and the restoration of production with pipelines and onshore facilities returning to service during after being shut in due to the hurricanes 
the hurricane activity caused us to defer production of approximately and bcfe in and  respectively 
oil and gas operating expenses 
our oil and gas operating expenses  including production taxes  increased million  or  to million in from million in our operating expenses per equivalent mcf produced were unchanged at for and the increase in total operating expenses was primarily related to increased production and higher lifting costs associated with the increased costs of services and materials and higher insurance costs following the hurricane activity 
in addition  our oil and gas operating expenses included million and million in and  respectively  for costs to repair damage resulting from the hurricane activity 
impairment 
we recorded an impairment to our oil and gas properties of million and million in and  respectively  on minor valued fields 
exploration expense 
in  we incurred million in exploration expense  which related to the cost of three unsuccessful exploratory wells drilled and the acquisition and reprocessing of d seismic data 
in  our exploration expense was million  which related to one dry hole and the acquisition and reprocessing of d seismic data 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in from million in our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense per equivalent mcf produced increased by  or  to for as compared to for the increase in the amortization rate was attributable to higher capitalized costs associated with the wells we drilled and the installation of new production facilities 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses  which are reported net of operating fees that we receive of million in  were million or higher than our net general and administrative expenses of million in these costs have increased primarily as a result of the management and staff that we hired after our formation as well as compliance costs associated with being a public company 
interest expense 
our interest expense for was million and million in interest expense increased in primarily due to higher borrowings outstanding and higher interest rates 
our average borrowings of million during increased from the million average borrowings we had outstanding in our average interest rate increased to in from in income taxes 
income tax expense decreased in to million from million in the tax provision included a million provision related to our conversion to a corporation 

table of contents net income 
we reported net income of million per share in as compared to a net loss of million per share year ended december  the net loss in resulted from the million provision for the deferred tax liability upon our conversion to a corporation 
excluding this one time provision and pro forma for income taxes  we would have reported net income of million per share in year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas sales 
our oil and gas sales in increased million to million from million for the increase in sales was attributable to higher oil and gas prices we realized in our average gas price increased and our average oil price increased in as compared to average prices in we had bcfe of production deferred in because of the hurricane activity 
our natural gas production increased and our oil production decreased from after taking into account the deferred production resulting from the hurricanes  our natural gas production gains related primarily to new wells drilled at vermillion blocks and and ship shoal blocks and the oil production decline was primarily attributable to our ship shoal unit 
oil and gas operating expenses 
our oil and gas operating costs for increased million to million from million in oil and gas operating expenses per equivalent mcf produced increased to in from in the increase in operating expenses in primarily is related to hurricane repair costs  operating costs of new wells put on production in as well as higher lifting costs per equivalent mcf produced due to the deferred production related to hurricane activity 
including the deferred production and excluding the repair cost of million we expensed in  our operating costs per mcfe would have been per mcfe in impairment 
we recorded an impairment to our oil and gas properties of million in related to a minor valued field where an impairment was indicated based on estimated future cash flows attributable to the field s estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
exploration expense 
we incurred million in exploration expense in which primarily related to the costs associated with drilling one exploratory dry hole and the acquisition and reprocessing of d seismic data 
in  our exploration expense of million included the cost of five unsuccessful exploratory wells drilled and the acquisition and reprocessing of d seismic data 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense decreased million to million from million in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense per equivalent mcf produced of in decreased as compared to for this decrease in the amortization rate primarily reflects reserve additions from successful exploratory wells drilled in general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses  which are reported net of operating fees that we receive  were million in during our general and administrative expenses were million for the period from january  to july  and million for the period from our inception on july  to december  these costs have increased primarily as a result of the management and staff that we hired after our formation as well as compliance costs associated with being a public company in included in general and administrative expenses are stock based compensation of million in and million for the period from our inception through december  interest expense 
interest expense for was million 
interest expense for the period from january  to july  was million and for the period from our inception to december  
table of contents was million 
interest expense decreased in primarily due to a reduction in borrowings outstanding 
average borrowings of million during was lower than the million average borrowings outstanding in the decrease due to the lower debt balances was partially offset by an increase in our average interest rate  which increased to in from in income taxes 
upon our conversion from a limited liability company to a corporation on may   we began to reflect a provision for income taxes for income subsequent to our conversion at an average tax rate of 
the provision for the period from may  to december  was million 
in connection with our conversion to a corporation  we recorded a one time provision of million to reflect our deferred tax liability on the date of conversion 
no income taxes were reflected for any period prior to the conversion as our taxable income was passed through to our members 
net income 
we reported a net loss of million per share in as compared to net income of million for the period from january  to july  and million for the period from our inception on july  to december  the net loss in resulted from the million provision for the deferred tax liability upon our conversion to a corporation 
without the one time provision and pro forma for income taxes  we would have reported net income of million per share in liquidity and capital resources funding for our activities has historically been provided by net cash flow from operating activities  borrowings under credit facilities and issuances of common stock 
in our primary sources of funds were net cash flow for operating activities of million  million borrowed under our bank credit facility and million from the proceeds from a sale of our common stock to comstock in a private placement 
in our primary sources of funds were million in net cash flow from operating activities  million borrowed under our bank credit facility  and million from our initial public offering 
for the period from our inception on july  through december   our primary sources of funds were net cash flow from operating activities of million and borrowings of million from comstock that we incurred in connection with our formation 
for the period from january  to july  our primary sources of funds were million of cash flow from operating activities and million of borrowings from comstock resources 
our cash flow from operating activities in increased by million to million as compared to million in primarily due to our higher revenues in which were attributable to the increase in our production 
cash flows from operating activities in of million increased by million from the combined cash flows from operating activities of million mainly due to higher revenues caused by increased natural gas prices 
our need for capital  in addition to funding our ongoing operations  primarily relates to our exploration for oil and natural gas reserves  the development and acquisition of our oil and gas properties and the repayment of our debt 
capital expenditures for exploration  development and exploration activities were million for the period from january  through july   million for the period from our inception on july  through december   and million and million for the years 
table of contents ended december  and  respectively 
our capital expenditure activity for the years ended december  and is summarized in the following table in thousands acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties acquisitions of unproved oil and gas leasehold exploration drilling development drilling offshore facilities other development costs other total excludes geological and geophysical expenses which are not capitalized and capitalized costs of asset retirement obligations 
our capital expenditures in increased by million over mostly due to acquisitions and higher drilling and construction costs in the gulf of mexico 
capital expenditures in increased million above the combined full year capital expenditures of million primarily due to our increased activity in our drilling program 
the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of our capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
we currently expect to spend approximately million for development and exploration projects in  which will be funded primarily by cash flows from operating activities 
however  our operating cash flow and therefore  our capital expenditures are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices 
our cash flow from financing activities of million increased million in as compared to million of cash flow provided by financing activities in financing activities in which funded our acquisition  exploration and development activities included additional borrowings under our bank credit facility and sale of additional shares of common stock to comstock 
cash flows from our financing activities in of million were comparable to the combined full year results of million 
financing activities in were mainly borrowings under our credit facility with comstock 
financing activities in include the proceeds from our initial public offering  the repayment of our borrowings from comstock and new borrowings under our bank credit facility to fund our exploration and development projects 
on may  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share to the public 
we sold  shares of common stock and received proceeds of million and a selling stockholder sold  shares  of which we received no proceeds 
prior to completing the offering  we converted from a limited liability company to a corporation and changed our name to bois d arc energy  inc on august   we completed the sale of  shares of common stock to comstock in a private placement for million 
the private offering was priced at per share  the closing market price as of august  proceeds from the sale were used to fund an acquisition of oil and gas properties and our drilling program 
we have a million bank credit facility with the bank of nova scotia and several other banks 
borrowings under the credit facility are limited to a borrowing base that is re determined semi annually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties 
the borrowing base was million  million of which was available as of december  the 
table of contents determination of the borrowing base is at the sole discretion of the administrative agent and the bank group 
the credit facility matures on may  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the company s option at either libor plus a margin that varies from to depending upon the ratio of the amounts outstanding to the borrowing base or the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus a margin that varies from to depending upon the ratio of the amounts outstanding to the borrowing base 
a commitment fee ranging from to depending upon the ratio of the amounts outstanding to the borrowing base is payable on the unused borrowing base 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets  and all of our subsidiaries are guarantors of the indebtedness 
the credit facility contains covenants that restrict the payment of cash dividends in excess of million  borrowings  sales of assets  loans to others  capital expenditures  investments  merger activity  hedging contracts  liens and certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders and requires us to maintain a ratio of current assets  including the availability under the bank credit facility  to current liabilities of at least one to one and a ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion  and amortization  exploration and impairment expense of no more than to one 
the following table summarizes our aggregate contractual liabilities and commitments as of december  by year of maturity thereafter total in thousands bank credit facility interest on debt obligations operating leases contracted drilling services acquisition of seismic data future interest expense on debt obligations is computed based upon the december  rate on our bank credit facility 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and future growth as contemplated under our current business plan 
however  if our plans or assumptions change or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional capital 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital  or if such capital is available  that we will be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and use assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues or expenses 
with respect to periods prior to july  the date of our formation  the discussion contained herein of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our predecessors combined financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of particular transactions is specifically required by gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements 
table of contents requires us to make estimates and use assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues or expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are detailed in note to our combined and consolidated financial statements 
we have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment or estimates by our management 
successful efforts accounting 
we are required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies 
there are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with finding oil and natural gas reserves  including certain general and administrative expenses 
the successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration projects 
costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive oil and gas reserves were not found 
we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas activities and we do not capitalize any of our general and administrative expenses 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities 
the determination of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense as well as impairments that are recognized on our oil and gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data  production history and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree imprecise  the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas prices may all differ materially from those assumed in these estimates 
the information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
thus  such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year s estimates 
such revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities  production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices 
any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition  our borrowing ability  our future prospects and the value of our common stock 
the estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves used in preparation of our predecessors combined financial statements were determined by an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm and were prepared in accordance with the rules promulgated by the sec and the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
the determination of impairment of our oil and gas reserves is based on the oil and gas reserve estimates using projected future oil and natural gas prices that we have determined to be reasonable 
the projected prices that we employ represent our long term oil and natural gas price forecast and may be higher or lower than the december  market prices for crude oil and natural gas 
for the impairment review of our oil and gas properties that we conducted as of december   we used oil and natural gas prices that were based on the current futures market 
we used an oil price of per barrel for and escalated prices by each year thereafter to a maximum price of per barrel 
for natural gas  we used a price of per mcf for and escalated prices by each year thereafter to a maximum price of per mcf 
the initial prices used were tied to the one year market prices for oil and natural gas 
to the extent we had used lower prices in our impairment review  an impairment could have been indicated on certain of our oil and gas properties 

table of contents asset retirement obligations 
we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to restore the seafloor at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
federal taxation 
deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the future tax consequences or benefits of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements using enacted tax rates 
we became a taxable entity as a result of our conversion from a limited liability company to a corporation on may  while we were a limited liability company  taxable income was passed through to our unit owners 
our predecessors were either individuals  partnerships or limited liability companies that passed through their taxable income to their owners 
provision for federal and state corporate income taxes have been only with respect to our operations subsequent to our conversion to may  upon our conversion from a limited liability company to a corporation on may   we established a million provision for deferred income taxes 
stock based compensation 
in connection with our formation  our unitholders approved our long term incentive plan the incentive plan to provide for equity based compensation for our executive officers  employees and consultants 
as a private limited liability company  the nature of our equity awards was more complex than in a corporation 
the initial awards made under the incentive plan were approved by the unit holders and were comprised of either i options to purchase class b units  representing a capital and profits interest in our company when we were a limited liability company  or ii restricted class c units  representing solely a profits interest in our company when we were a limited liability company 
the only consultant who received an award under the incentive plan was gayle laufer  the spouse of our chief executive officer 
the incentive plan was amended and restated in connection with our conversion to a corporation in order to reflect our status as a corporation 
at the time of our formation  we granted options to purchase a total of  class b units at an exercise price of per unit and  restricted class c units 
in determining the fair value of the class b units and class c units underlying the equity awards granted  we used a valuation methodology that we believe is consistent with the practices recommended by the aicpa audit and accounting practice aid series  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation the practice aid 
we reviewed the guidance set forth in the practice aid and performed a retrospective valuation on a top down basis  using an enterprise valuation model 
we determined the fair value of the entity and then allocated the enterprise value to the various classes of member units 
we also consulted with an independent valuation specialist regarding the methods and procedures used to determine  on a retrospective basis  the fair value of the class b units and the class c units at the time of issuance 
we follow the fair value based method prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r in accounting for equity based compensation 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the award vesting period 
we adopted sfas r utilizing the modified prospective transition method and accordingly our financial results for periods prior to january  have not been adjusted 
prior to adopting sfas r we followed the fair value based method prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation since our inception 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the award vesting period 
because we previously recorded stock based compensation using the fair value method  adoption of 
table of contents sfas r did not have a significant impact on our net income or earnings per share for the year ended december  new accounting standards 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and we adopted fin at the beginning of fiscal the impact of adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this statement establishes a framework for fair value measurements in the financial statements by providing a single definition of fair value  provides guidance on the methods used to estimate fair value and increases disclosures about estimates of fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and is generally applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb also issued fsp aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities fsp aug air 
this fsp addresses the planned major maintenance of assets and prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for these activities 
this fsp is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of this fsp  but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions in recent years  we have not entered into any material transactions with our officers or directors apart from the compensation they are provided for their services 
we also have not entered into any material business transactions with our significant stockholders or any other related parties except for the sale of  shares of our common stock to comstock for million in august item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s oil and natural gas prices our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
factors influencing oil and natural gas prices include the level of global demand for crude oil  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions which determine the demand for natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in our oil and natural gas reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse affect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and natural gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on our oil and natural gas production in  a change in the price per barrel of oil would have resulted in a change in our cash flow for such period by approximately million and a change in the price per mcf of natural gas would have changed our cash flow by approximately million 

table of contents interest rates at december   we had million outstanding under our bank credit facility  which is subject to floating market rates of interest 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is tied to libor or the corporate base rate  at our option 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
based on borrowings outstanding at december   a basis point change in interest rates would change our annual interest expense on our variable rate debt by approximately million
