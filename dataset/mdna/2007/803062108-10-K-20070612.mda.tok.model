we price our work based on established rates that vary according to our consultants experience levels  roles and geographic locations 
our time and materials contracts include arrangements in which we perform services based on an estimated fee range  or in which we cap our total fees 
under capped time and materials arrangements in which we agree to 
table of contents complete certain deliverables for the client during the project  we assume the risk that we have estimated the correct level of effort and timeframe to complete the deliverables at a cost that does not exceed the cap 
in fixed price contracts  similarly  we assume the risk of estimating the scope of work and resources required correctly and undertaking rigorous project management throughout an engagement to ensure we deliver the project on time and on budget 
we may recognize losses or lower profitability on fixed price contracts if we do not successfully manage the foregoing risks 
additionally  these risks are magnified with respect to large projects into which we are entering more frequently and multi staged projects in which we perform our scope and labor estimates  and fix the total project price through implementation  at an early stage of an engagement

we organize our sales professionals primarily along industry lines  both within our us and international business units 
we believe that the industry and geographic focus of our sales professionals enhances their knowledge and expertise in these industries and generates additional client engagements 
we continue to actively build relationships and strategic alliances with technology and other consulting companies  including packaged technology vendors

we believe that these relationships and strategic alliances enable us to provide better delivery and value to our existing clients and attract new clients through referrals 
competition the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms  offshore outsourcing companies  marketing agencies and clients internal information systems departments 
to a lesser extent  we compete with boutique consulting firms that maintain specialized skills and or are geography based 
with respect to our government services practice  we both compete and partner with large defense contractors 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include ability to solve business problems  ability to provide innovative solutions  expertise and talent with advanced technologies  global scale  expertise in delivering complex projects through teams located in globally distributed geographies  quality and speed of delivery  price of solutions  industry knowledge  technology enabled marketing expertise  understanding of user experience  and sophisticated project and program management capability 
we believe that we compete favorably when considering these factors and that our ability to deliver business innovation and outstanding value to our clients on time and on budget  our gdd model  and our successful track record in doing so  distinguishes us from our competitors 
intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary consulting methodology  custom developed software and other rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
our services involve the development of business  technology and marketing solutions for specific client engagements 
ownership of these solutions is the subject of negotiation and is frequently assigned to the client  although we often retain ownership of certain development tools and may be granted a license to use the solutions for certain purposes 
certain of our clients have prohibited us from marketing for specified periods of time or to specified third parties the solutions we develop for them  and we anticipate that certain of our clients will demand similar or other restrictions in the future

risk factors risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted by economic conditions and related fluctuations in customer demand for business  technology and other consulting services 
the market for our consulting services and the technologies used in our solutions historically have tended to fluctuate with economic cycles particularly those cycles in the united states and the united kingdom  where we earn the majority of our revenues 
during economic cycles in which many companies are experiencing financial difficulties or uncertainty  clients and potential clients may cancel or delay spending on technology and other business initiatives 
military actions in iraq and elsewhere  global terrorism  natural disasters and political unrest are among the factors that may adversely impact regional and global economic conditions and  concomitantly  client investments in our services 
although economic conditions in our industry have been improving in recent years  a sudden or gradual downturn in these conditions may cause large companies to cancel or delay consulting initiatives for which they have engaged us 
further  if the rate of cancellations or delays significantly increases  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
our market is highly competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete effectively 
the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms  offshore outsourcing companies  and clients internal information systems departments 
other competitors include interactive and traditional advertising agencies  and  to a lesser extent  boutique consulting firms that maintain specialized skills and or are geography based 
in our government services practice  we both compete and partner with large defense contractors 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  and generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition  than we do 
often  these competitors offer a larger and more diversified suite of products and services than we offer 
these competitors may win client engagements by significantly discounting their services in exchange for a client s promise to purchase other goods and services from the competitor  either concurrently or in the future 
if we cannot keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our international operations and global distributed delivery gdd model subject us to increased risk 
we currently have international offices in the united kingdom  germany  the netherlands  india and canada 
our international operations are a significant percentage of our total revenues  and our gdd model is a key component of our ability to deliver our services successfully 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  including economic recessions in foreign countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates or impositions of restrictive currency controls  political instability  war or military conflict  changes in regulatory requirements  
table of contents complexities and costs in effectively managing multi national operations and associated internal controls and procedures  significant changes in immigration policies or difficulties in obtaining required immigration approvals for international assignments  restrictions imposed on the import and export of technologies in countries where we operate  and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries 
in particular  our gdd model depends heavily on our offices in new delhi and bangalore  india  where approximately of our worldwide employees are located 
any escalation in the political or military instability in india or pakistan or the surrounding countries  or a business interruption resulting from a natural disaster  such as an earthquake  could hinder our ability to use gdd successfully and could result in material adverse effects to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the delivery of our services from remote locations causes us to rely on data  phone  power and other networks which are not as reliable as those in other countries where we operate 
any failures of these systems could affect the success of our gdd model 
remote delivery of our services also increases the complexity and risk of delivering our services  which could affect our ability to satisfy our clients expectations or perform our services within the estimated time frame and budget for each project 
if we do not attract and retain qualified professional staff  we may be unable to perform adequately our client engagements and could be limited in accepting new client engagements 
our business is people intensive  and our success depends upon our ability to attract  retain  train and motivate highly skilled employees 
the improvement in demand for business and technology consulting services has further increased the need for employees with specialized skills or significant experience in business  marketing and technology consulting  particularly at senior levels 
we have been expanding our operations in all locations  and these expansion efforts will be highly dependent on attracting a sufficient number of highly skilled people 
we may not be successful in attracting enough employees to achieve our desired expansion or staffing plans 
furthermore  the industry turnover rates for these types of employees are high  and we may not be successful in retaining  training and motivating the employees we attract 
any inability to attract  retain  train and motivate employees could impair our ability to manage adequately and complete existing projects and to bid for or accept new client engagements 
such inability may also force us to increase our hiring of expensive independent contractors  which may increase our costs and reduce our profitability on client engagements 
we must also devote substantial managerial and financial resources to monitoring and managing our workforce and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage the levels and related costs of our workforce and other resources effectively 
we earn revenues  incur costs and maintain cash balances in multiple currencies  and currency fluctuations affect our financial results 
we have significant international operations  and we frequently earn our revenues and incur our costs in various foreign currencies 
our international segment revenues were million for the year ended december  doing business in these foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks in numerous areas  including revenues and receivables  purchases  payroll and investments 
we also have a significant amount of foreign currency net asset exposures 
certain foreign currency exposures  to some extent  are naturally offset within an international business unit  because revenues and costs are denominated in the same foreign currency  and certain cash balances are held in us dollar denominated accounts 
however  due to the increasing size and importance of our international operations  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our financial results 
our gdd model also subjects us to increased currency risk  because we frequently incur a significant portion of our project costs in indian rupees and earn revenue from our clients in other currencies 
currently  we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our foreign currency risk  but we may adopt such strategies in the future 
our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds from our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries outside the united states could 
table of contents have adverse tax consequences and be limited by foreign currency exchange controls 
however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
we have transferred  and will continue to transfer  cash from those subsidiaries to the parent company  and to other international subsidiaries  when it is cost effective to do so 
however  any fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact the availability and size of these funds for repatriation or transfer 
we have significant fixed operating costs  which may be difficult to adjust in response to unanticipated fluctuations in revenues 
a high percentage of our operating expenses  particularly personnel  rent  depreciation and amortization of intangible assets  are fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result  an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of  or an unanticipated delay in the scheduling for  our projects may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that quarter 
an unanticipated termination or decrease in size or scope of a major project  a client s decision not to proceed with a project we anticipated or the completion during a quarter of several major client projects could require us to maintain underutilized employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues and earnings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of such factors as the contractual terms and timing of completion of projects  including achievement of certain business results  any delays incurred in connection with projects  the adequacy of provisions for losses and bad debts  the accuracy of our estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  loss of key highly skilled personnel necessary to complete projects  and general economic conditions 
we may lose money if we do not accurately estimate the costs of fixed price engagements 
many of our projects are based on fixed price contracts  rather than contracts in which payment to us is determined on a time and materials basis 
our failure to estimate accurately the resources and schedule required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price contract was based  could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are consistently entering into contracts for large projects that magnify this risk 
we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in losses on those contracts 
we will likely experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the project engagement  which could result in a fixed price that is too low 
therefore  this incorrect estimation could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability will be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain our pricing and utilization rates and control our costs 
our profitability derives from and is impacted by three factors  primarily i the prices for our services  ii our consultants utilization or billable time  and iii our costs 
to achieve our desired level of profitability our utilization must remain at an appropriate rate  and we must contain our costs 
should we reduce our prices in the future as a result of pricing pressures  or should we be unable to achieve our target utilization rates and costs  our profitability could be adversely impacted and the price of our securities could decline materially 

table of contents we partner with third parties on certain complex engagements in which our performance depends upon  and may be adversely impacted by  the performance of such third parties 
certain complex projects may require that we partner with specialized software or systems vendors or other partners to perform our services 
often in these circumstances  we are liable to our clients for the performance of these third parties 
should the third parties fail to perform timely or satisfactorily  our clients may elect to terminate the projects or withhold payment until the services have been completed successfully 
additionally  the timing of our revenue recognition may be affected or we may realize lower profits if we incur additional costs due to delays or because we must assign additional personnel to complete the project 
furthermore  our relationships with our clients and our reputation generally may suffer harm as a result of our partners unsatisfactory performance 
our clients could unexpectedly terminate their contracts for our services 
some of our contracts can be canceled by the client with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
a client s termination of a contract for our services could result in a loss of expected revenues and additional expenses for staff that were allocated to that client s project 
we could be required to maintain underutilized employees who were assigned to the terminated contract 
the unexpected cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of any of our large projects  or client termination of one or more recurring revenue contracts see definition of recurring revenues in item  above  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by unauthorized disclosures of confidential information or by our failure to remedy system failures 
we frequently receive confidential information from our clients  including confidential customer data that we use to develop solutions 
if any person  including a company employee  misappropriates client confidential information  or if client confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems  system failures or otherwise  we may have substantial liabilities to our clients or client customers 
further  many of our projects involve technology applications or systems that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and handle very large volumes of transactions 
if we fail to perform our services correctly  we may be unable to deliver applications or systems to our clients with the promised functionality or within the promised time frame  or to satisfy the required service levels for support and maintenance 
while we have taken precautionary actions to create redundancy and back up systems  any such failures by us could result in claims by our clients for substantial damages against us 
although we attempt to limit the amount and type of our contractual liability for breaches of confidentiality and defects in the applications or systems we provide and carry insurance coverage which mitigates these liabilities in certain instances  we cannot be assured that these limitations and insurance coverages will be applicable and enforceable in all cases 
even if these limitations and insurance coverages are found to be applicable and enforceable  our liability to our clients for these types of claims could be material in amount and affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  such claims may harm our reputation and cause us to lose clients 
our services may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  and create liability for us as well as harm our reputation and client relationships 
the services that we offer to clients may infringe the intellectual property ip rights of third parties and result in legal claims against our clients and sapient 
these claims may damage our reputation  adversely impact our client relationships and create liability for us 
moreover  although we generally agree in our client contracts to indemnify the clients for expenses or liabilities they incur as a result of third party ip infringement claims associated with our services  the resolution of these claims  irrespective of whether a court determines that our services infringed another party s ip rights  may be time consuming  disruptive to our business and extraordinarily costly 
finally  in connection with an ip infringement dispute  we may be required to cease using or developing certain ip that we offer to our clients 
these circumstances could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue as well as require us to incur significant expense to develop alternative or modified services for our clients 

table of contents we may be unable to protect our proprietary methodology our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary methodology and other intellectual property rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our stock price is volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
our trading price could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and achievement of key business metrics by us or our competitors  changes in operating results estimates by securities analysts  any differences between our reported results and securities analysts published or unpublished expectations  announcements of new contracts or service offerings made by us or our competitors  announcements of acquisitions or joint ventures made by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
the commencement of this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
our former chairmen and chief executive officers have significant voting power and may effectively control the outcome of any stockholder vote 
jerry a 
greenberg  our former co chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company and j 
stuart moore  our former co chairman of the board and co chief executive officer and current member of our board of directors  own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  they have the ability to substantially influence and may effectively control the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sapient  even if such a change in control would benefit other investors 
we are dependent on our key employees 
our success depends in large part upon the continued services of a number of key employees 
our employment arrangements with key personnel provide that employment is terminable at will by either party 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if our key employees resign from sapient to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of such personnel and any resulting loss of existing or potential clients to any such competitor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we require our employees to sign agreements prohibiting them from joining a competitor  forming a competing company or soliciting our clients or employees for certain periods of time  we cannot be certain that these agreements will be effective in preventing our key employees from engaging in these actions or that courts or other adjudicative entities will substantially enforce these agreements 
we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from acquisitions and joint ventures 
the anticipated benefits from any acquisitions or joint ventures that we may undertake might not be achieved 
for example  if we acquire a company  we cannot be certain that clients of the acquired business will continue to conduct business with us  or that employees of the acquired business will continue their employment or integrate 
table of contents successfully into our operations and culture 
the identification  consummation and integration of acquisitions and joint ventures require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of management s attention  as well as any difficulties encountered in the integration process  could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  we may incur significant expenses in completing any such acquisitions  and we may assume significant liabilities  some of which may be unknown at the time of such acquisition 
we note  in particular  our ongoing efforts to integrate and assimilate our experience marketing reporting segment  following our acquisition of pgi in early failure to complete this initiative in a timely and efficient manner may adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not effectively improve our operational and financial processes and systems  our ability to achieve efficiencies and cost savings may be delayed and our results of operations may be adversely impacted 
to streamline our general and administrative infrastructure and costs as a percentage of revenue and ensure that the company can appropriately scale as our business expands  since early we have been redesigning many operational processes and transitioning certain internal  non billable roles to our india office 
the activities principally relate to finance  human resources and certain it functions 
if we do not timely  efficiently and effectively upgrade or replace systems  redesign processes and implement the preceding role transitions and necessary training as our business requires  we may be unable to support our growth effectively or realize cost savings as quickly as expected or maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting 
additionally  the quality of our services may decline pending the successful completion of these initiatives 
consequently  our results of operations may be adversely impacted 
in fact  as indicated below in this item a and in item a  challenges that we have encountered relating to the transition of several finance functions to our offices in india have contributed in significant part to management s conclusion that a material weakness exists in the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  the failure to successfully and timely implement certain financial system changes to improve operating efficiency and enhance our reporting controls could harm our business 
in parallel with the foregoing operational process redesign and role transition activities  we have implemented and continue to install several upgrades and enhancements to our financial systems 
failure to successfully execute these initiatives in a timely  effective and efficient manner could result in the disruption of our operations  the inability to comply with our sarbanes oxley obligations and the inability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner 
management s determination that a material weakness exists in our internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on the company 
we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in item a of this annual report  management reports that a material weakness exists in the company s internal control over financial reporting as a result of a significant disruption to our financial accounting organization  processes and workload during that was attributable to the i transition of key accounting and administrative functions and processes to india during  ii changes in the finance organization and resultant significant turnover in the company s finance and accounting staff  including three chief financial officers during  and iii investigation and restatement of the company s financial statements relating to historical stock option granting practices  which have required significant financial research  analysis and incremental recordkeeping 
due to this material weakness  management has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report  the company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective 
consequently  and pending the company s remediation of the matters that have caused the control deficiencies underlying the material weakness  our business and results of operations could be harmed  we may be unable to report properly or timely the results of our operations  and investors may lose faith in the reliability of our financial statements 
accordingly  the price of our securities may be adversely and materially impacted

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of prior period financial statements background of the restatement as announced on august   the audit committee of sapient s board of directors audit committee initiated a voluntary  independent investigation into the company s historical stock based compensation practices after a management review discovered irregularities in certain past stock option grants for the periods through one committee member who had been on the compensation committee during this period recused himself from participation 
on november   the audit committee announced that the results of the internal investigation indicated a lack of controls and documentation  principally prior to  around the company s stock based compensation granting process  as well as irregularities relating to pricing of certain grants of options to purchase the company s common stock options or stock options awarded principally during the period from through the identified period 
with the exception of the day and day pricing  which occurred primarily in and  the audit committee did not find any evidence of a systematic effort to intentionally backdate stock option grants on a large scale 
the audit committee s report included the following key findings the investigation found no misconduct by any of the individuals who were serving on the company s management team as of the conclusion of the audit committee s internal investigation 
the investigation found that the company s former ceo  jerry greenberg  former cfo  susan cooke and former general counsel  deborah gray  participated  to varying degrees  in issuing these grants 
all three participated in the authorization of the day pricing practice and in certain instances of targeted pricing 
additionally  the investigation found that the former cfo and former general counsel participated in the authorization of re pricing and look back pricing of grants in connection with certain of the company s acquisitions in and the investigation was inconclusive on whether the former ceo and former general counsel fully understood the accounting and disclosure ramifications of these practices 
the audit committee found evidence that the former cfo knew that certain practices had accounting and disclosure implications but failed to take steps to ensure that the accounting for those practices was proper 
the former ceo  who received no stock options in the years since his co founding sapient  resigned from the company in october the former cfo also resigned then 
the former general counsel  deborah gray  left the company in january stuart moore  a member of the board of directors  who co founded sapient and was co ceo until june  never received stock options and did not participate in issuing these grants 
some members of current management received options that  in some cases  had prices corresponding to a date earlier than the measurement date for accounting purposes 
none of the members of current management were in a position at the time to approve their own option grants 
certain outside members of the board of directors received options that had prices corresponding to a date other than the measurement date for accounting purposes 
in some instances board members receiving these grants had executed written consents approving the grants  although none of the members of the board of directors directed the pricing of options they received or the pricing of any other options 
the audit committee and management concluded that the actual measurement date  as that term is defined in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 was different from the measurement date recorded by the company for a number of grants of options to purchase the company s common stock options or stock options which were awarded to both section officers and directors and other employees 
as a result of having identified these incorrect measurement dates and other errors 
table of contents described below in accounting for stock option grants  management concluded that the company s previously issued financial statements should be restated 
the issues identified by the investigation fall into the following main categories a lack of certain documentation for company wide grants 
with respect to certain of the grants that were typically made on an annual or semi annual basis to all eligible rank and file employees in the company company wide grants  there is a lack of certain supporting documentation 
b grants without proper authorization 
these grants which were primarily to new hires or in connection with promotions were made i by individuals who may not have been explicitly delegated the authority to make grants under the relevant plans eg  grants were authorized by one of the company s two co ceos  during a period when approval from both co ceos was required under the terms of the plans  ii in amounts beyond the ranges authorized by the compensation committee  or iii without compensation committee approval  when such approval was required eg  a grant to an individual who had been designated as a section officer 
c day  day or day pricing for grants 
certain grants were priced at the lowest quoted market price in the days  days or days following the date of grant 
it appears that this practice occurred primarily in and d targeted pricing 
certain grants were made to an individual or small group of individuals in which the measurement date recorded by the company preceded the appropriate measurement date as determined under apb no 
 and in which it appears that the earlier measurement date was chosen in part because pricing was favorable on that date 
e grants issued in connection with business acquisitions 
for grants issued to employees who joined the company in connection with two acquisitions which occurred in  it was determined that both acquisitions granted options priced utilizing a day look back where the company priced the options at the lowest stock price in the day period after the acquisition 
the company determined that options granted in connection with one acquisition in were repriced 
f promotion grants 
in certain instances  the company priced grants as of the date the promotion was authorized  rather than the date that the terms of the stock option grant including the number of shares to be granted were finalized 
in some instances  this practice resulted in more favorable prices and in some instances it did not result in more favorable pricing 
g grants authorized by written consent 
these grants  primarily to senior personnel within the company  and in one instance in to outside directors on the board  were authorized by written consents bearing a date which was used to establish the exercise price  and which was significantly earlier than the date the written consents were fully executed 
h administrative errors 
these grants comprise several instances where stock based compensation grants were mispriced due to what appears to be administrative or clerical errors  such as failing to correctly input a date from a grant list 
upon the conclusion of the internal investigation  the company completed an assessment of the appropriate measurement dates and the related accounting for the matters described above 
the company is restating the financial statements and related disclosures described above in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to record the following non cash stock based compensation expense for the difference between the option price and the quoted market price on the measurement date  other immaterial adjustments that were not previously recorded  and related tax effects for all items 

table of contents summary of the restatement adjustments the restatement principally reflects additional stock based compensation expense and related tax effects pertaining to the company s historical stock based compensation practices under apb no 
 the company s accounting method for periods prior to january  the following is a summary of the pre tax compensation expense associated with the adjusted options to be recognized in each period from to in thousands compensation period expense cumulative adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of january  total related tax adjustments the company reviewed the tax effects associated with the adjusted options 
many of the adjusted options were originally intended to be incentive stock options isos  under us income tax regulations 
however  by definition  isos may not be granted with an exercise price less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
due to the impact of the measurement date changes on the qualified status of affected isos  they may no longer qualify as isos under the regulations 
therefore  the affected isos were accounted for as if these options were non qualified stock options for income tax accounting purposes 
the company recorded a liability for the unpaid income and employment taxes plus potential penalties and interest based upon the change in status of the affected options 
the company recorded a liability for the taxes  penalties and interest due based upon the change in status of the options in the amount of million for the periods through the company recorded reversals of this accrual in the amount of million through due to the expiration of the payroll tax statute of limitations for years and prior

summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

table of contents disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ substantially from our estimates 
a summary of those accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the provision of professional services  digital marketing services and offline printing and production services arrangements with our clients when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services or product have been provided to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where the customer  at its discretion  has the right to reject the services or product prior to final acceptance  revenue is deferred until such acceptance occurs 
we recognize revenues from our fixed price technology implementation consulting contracts using the percentage of completion method pursuant to statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues generated from fixed price non technology implementation contracts  except for support and maintenance contracts  are recognized based upon a proportional performance model in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab no 
as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

our percentage of completion method and our proportional performance method of accounting calculates revenue based on the percentage of labor incurred to estimated total labor 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and labor applicable to various stages of an arrangement can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized as services are provided 
revenue generated from staff augmentation and support contracts are recognized ratably over the arrangement s term 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually review labor incurred and estimated total labor  which may result in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue under an arrangement 
certain arrangements provide for revenue to be generated based upon the achievement of certain performance standards 
revenue related to the achievement of performance standards was immaterial for any of the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements 
revenues from arrangements with multiple elements are allocated based on the fair value of the elements in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf no 

for these arrangements  we evaluate all deliverables in the arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
fair value is determined based on reliable evidence of the fair value of each deliverable 
revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand alone basis  fair value of the separate elements exists and  in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element  performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially under our control 
this evaluation is performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered 
the evaluation involves significant judgments regarding the nature of the services and deliverables being provided  whether these services and deliverables can reasonably be divided into the separate units of accounting and the fair value of the separate elements determined 
revenues related to our digital marketing media sales are recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass through expenses charged to a client 
in most cases  the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements  because of various pass through expenses such as production and media costs 
in compliance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  eitf no 
we assess whether the 
table of contents agency or the third party supplier is the primary obligor 
we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment 
in addition  we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price  discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor 
because we broadly operate as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis  we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting 
accordingly  we record revenue net of pass through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business 
in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal  we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue 
our marketing services help our clients optimize their cross platform marketing effectively to track behavior and improve conversion rates through data driven analysis 
these services are provided in exchange for monthly retainer fees and license fees and are recognized as the monthly services are provided 
revenue from offline printing and production services are recognized at the time title of the related items transfers to our customers given all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed for an arrangement or we do not manage the project properly within the planned time period  then we may recognize a loss on the arrangement 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted arrangements are made on an arrangement by arrangement basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses are identified 
we have committed unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those arrangements 
we expect that we will experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that is too low and  therefore  a correct estimation could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenue for services when collection from the client is reasonably assured  and our fees are fixed or determinable 
we establish billing terms at the time project deliverables and milestones are agreed 
our normal payment terms are thirty days from invoice date 
revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled revenues 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually monitor timely payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policy  detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation expense 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results for the implementation of sfas no 
r 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after january  and the portion of awards granted prior to january  but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to sfas no 
r s adoption  we accounted for share based payments under apb no 
and accordingly  generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price 

table of contents based on historical experience the company has assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to its senior executives and directors  and a forfeiture rate for its remaining employees 
the company will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change to reflect forfeiture assumption for stock based compensation recorded in prior periods resulted in income of  and was recognized in the statement of operations for the three month period ending march  determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management determined that using historical volatility of its own stock is an indicator of expected volatility 
therefore  expected volatility for option grants was based on the daily closing prices of our common stock during the year period ended december  the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated condensed financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
accounting for income taxes 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate all available evidence  such as recent and expected future operating results by tax jurisdiction  current and enacted tax legislation and other temporary differences between book and tax accounting  to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of operating losses incurred in  and  and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  relating to the deferred tax assets in the united states 
having assessed the ability to realize the deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions  we believe that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax benefit of the deferred tax assets in canada  the united kingdom  and germany 
the establishment and amount of the valuation allowance requires significant estimates and judgment and can materially affect our results of operations 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss in each jurisdiction  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has evaluated fin and determined that there is no material impact of adopting this interpretation 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment on a regular basis for the existence of facts and circumstances that may suggest that the carrying amount of an asset  or group of assets  may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount  the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
determining the fair value of long lived assets includes significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results 
valuation of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
the standard also includes provisions for the assessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangible assets and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  disposition of a significant portion of an operating segment  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred includes significant judgment from management 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair value of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
the company s reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note of our consolidated financial statements 
assets and liabilities  including goodwill were allocated to reporting units based on factors such as specific identification and percentage of revenue 
to conduct a goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
management estimates the fair value of its reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenue  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets and operating plans 
we performed the annual assessment during the fourth quarter of and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
we complete goodwill impairment analyses at least annually  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
determining fair value of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management and different judgments could yield different results 
costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use 
we account for costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
as required by sop  the company capitalizes the costs incurred during the application development stage  which include costs to design the software configuration and interfaces  coding  installation and testing 
costs incurred for internal use computer software during the preliminary project stage and through post implementation stages of internal use computer software are expensed as incurred 
the capitalization and ongoing assessment of recoverability of development cost requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  technological and economic feasibility  and estimated economic life 

table of contents capitalized software is included in property and equipment and is depreciated over its estimated life  which is typically three years 
restructuring and other related charges 
we established exit plans for each of the restructuring activities which took place in and and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf no 

these exit plans required that we make estimates as to the nature  timing and amount of the exit costs that we specifically identified 
the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates  which included contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space vacated and related costs  offset by estimated sub lease income 
we review on a regular basis our sub lease assumptions and lease buy out assumptions 
these estimates include lease buy out costs  anticipated sublease rates  other terms and conditions in sub lease contracts  and the timing of these sub lease arrangements 
if the rental markets continue to change  our lease buy out  sub lease and space requirement assumptions may not be accurate and it is possible that changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our sublease reserve is sensitive to the level of sublease rent anticipated and the timing of sublease commencement 
if the estimated sublease dates were to be delayed by six months  based on our current estimates  we would potentially have to recognize an additional  in our statement of operations for restructuring and other related charges 
a reduction in our sublease rate would have resulted in an additional  of charges as of the end of if any future adjustments are required to the restructuring initiatives recorded under the provisions of eitf no 
 such adjustments will be measured in accordance with eitf no 
sfas no

 employers accounting for postemployment benefits sfas no 

sfas no 
prescribes the accounting for the estimated cost of benefits  including severance benefits  provided by an employer to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement 
a liability is recognized when the severance amounts relate to prior services rendered  the payment of the amount is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
since the second quarter of  we have accounted for severance related restructuring charges in accordance with sfas no 
because we have a history of paying similar severance benefits since contingent liabilities 
we have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various legal claims totaling approximately million and various administrative audits  each of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we have an accrual at december  of approximately  related to certain of these items 
we intend to defend these matters vigorously  although the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain and the potential loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than the amounts we have previously accrued 
further  as noted in item  the pending derivative actions do not assert a claim against the company for specific monetary damages and  accordingly  the amounts described herein are exclusive of any potential future monetary damages that the company may incur as a result of the derivative actions 
we record expense for legal services at the time such services are provided 
accounting for acquisitions 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenues and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives and  as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
the impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates 
additionally  under sfas no 
 we determine the fair value of the reporting unit  for purposes of the first step in our annual goodwill impairment test based on a discounted future cash 
table of contents flows approach 
if prior or future acquisitions are not accretive to our results of operations as expected  or the fair value of a reporting unit declines dramatically  we may be required to complete the second step which requires significant judgments and estimates and which may result in material impairment charges in the period in which they are determined
