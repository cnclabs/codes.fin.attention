description of business we are a publicly traded specialty risk management company  with an emphasis on alternative market insurance and risk management solutions for agents  professional and trade associations  and small to medium sized insureds 
the alternative market includes a wide range of approaches to financing and managing risk exposures  such as captives  rent a captives  risk retention and risk purchasing groups  governmental pools and trusts  and self insurance plans 
the alternative market developed as a result of the historical volatility in the cost and availability of traditional commercial insurance coverages  and usually involves some form of self insurance or risk sharing on the part of the client 
we develop and manage alternative risk management programs for defined client groups and their members 
we also operate as an insurance agency representing unaffiliated insurance companies in placing insurance coverages for policyholders 
we define our business segments as specialty risk management operations and agency operations 
in june  we sold  shares of newly issued common stock at per share in a public offering 
in conjunction  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option to acquire  of additional shares of our common stock 
after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions  and expenses  we received net proceeds from the offering of million 
we utilized million of the million raised in the public offering to pay down our line of credit by million and contributed million to the surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries 
the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
since  we have issued million and million in junior subordinated debentures and senior debentures  respectively 
we received a total of million in net proceeds from the issuances of these debentures  of which was contributed to the surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries and the remaining balance was used for general corporate purposes 
these debentures are callable after five years from the date of issuance 
with the five year period approaching in for the junior subordinated debentures issued in  we will be reviewing the capital strategy associated with refinancing at lower costs through debentures or equity 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued specialty risk management operations our specialty risk management operations segment focuses on specialty or niche insurance business in which we provide various services and coverages tailored to meet the specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
these services include risk management consulting  claims administration and handling  loss control and prevention  and reinsurance placement  along with various types of property and casualty insurance coverage  including workers compensation  commercial multiple peril  general liability  commercial auto liability  and inland marine 
insurance coverage is provided primarily to associations or similar groups of members and to specified classes of business of our agent partners 
we recognize revenue related to the services and coverages from our specialty risk management operations within seven categories net earned premiums  management fees  claims fees  loss control fees  reinsurance placement  investment income  and net realized gains losses 
we categorize our programs into three categories managed  risk sharing  and fully insured 
with managed programs  we earn service fee revenue by providing management and other services to a client s risk bearing entity  but generally do not share in the operating results 
with risk sharing programs  we share the operating results with the client through a reinsurance agreement with a captive or rent a captive 
the captive and rent a captive structures are licensed reinsurance companies  which have a self sustaining integrated set of activities and assets  and are in the reinsurance business for the purpose of providing a return to their investors  who are the shareholders primary beneficiaries of the captive company 
these primary beneficiaries have their own equity at risk  decision making authority  and the ability to absorb losses and are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
in addition to premium revenue and investment income from our net retained portion of the operating results  we may also be compensated through the receipt of ceding commissions and other fees for policy issuance services and acquisition costs  captive administration  reinsurance placement  loss prevention services  and claims administrative and handling services 
in addition  we may benefit from the fees our risk management subsidiary earns for services we perform on behalf of our insurance company subsidiaries 
these fees are eliminated upon consolidation 
however  the fees associated with the captive s portion of the program are reimbursed through a ceding commission 
for financial reporting purposes  ceding commissions are treated as a reduction in underwriting expenses 
with fully insured programs  we provide our insurance products without a risk bearing mechanism and derive revenue from net earned premiums and investment income 
fully insured programs are generally developed in response to a specific market opportunity and when we believe there is potential to evolve into a risk sharing mechanism 
agency operations we earn commission revenue through the operation of our retail property and casualty insurance agencies  located in michigan  california  and florida 
the agency operations produce commercial  personal lines  life  and accident and health insurance  for more than fifty unaffiliated insurance carriers 
the agency produces an immaterial amount of business for our affiliated insurance company subsidiaries 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in recent years  we have derived our revenue from the following sources in thousands for the years ended december  revenues net earned premiums management fees claims fees loss control fees reinsurance placement investment income net realized gains specialty risk management agency operations miscellaneous income intersegment revenue consolidated revenue during  we accelerated the recognition of million in deferred claim revenue  as a result of an earlier than anticipated termination of two limited duration administrative services and multi state claims run off contracts 
these contracts had been terminated by the liquidator for the companies during the third quarter of had the contract not been terminated  we would have received additional claims fee revenue for continued claims handling services 
the miscellaneous income included in the revenue relates to interest income within the holding company 
critical accounting estimates general in certain circumstances  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on a variety of factors 
there can be no assurance  however  the actual results will not be materially different than our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operation will not be affected by accounting adjustments needed to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
losses and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of a loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and lae 
we establish a liability for losses and lae  which represent case base estimates of reported unpaid losses and lae and actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported losses ibnr and lae 
such liabilities  by necessity  are based upon estimates and  while we believe the amount of our reserves is adequate  the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the estimate 
as of december  and  we have accrued million and million of gross loss and lae reserves  respectively 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the following table sets forth our gross and net reserves for losses and lae based upon an underlying source of data  at december  in thousands case ibnr total direct assumed directly managed assumed residual markets assumed retroceded assumed other gross less ceded net directly managed represents business managed and processed by our underwriting  claims  and loss control departments  utilizing our internal systems and related controls 
residual markets represent mandatory pooled workers compensation business based upon an individual company s market share by state 
in reference to the above table  the reserves related to our direct business and assumed business which we manage directly  are established through transactions processed through our internal systems and related controls 
accordingly  the case reserves are established on a current basis  therefore there is no backlog  and ibnr is determined utilizing various actuarial methods based upon historical data 
ultimate reserve estimates related to assumed business from residual markets are provided by individual states on a two quarter lag and include an estimated reserve based upon actuarial methods for this lag 
assumed business which is subsequently retroceded to participating reinsurers relates to business previously discontinued and now is in run off 
lastly  in relation to assumed business from other sources  we receive case and paid loss data within a forty five day reporting period and develop our estimates for ibnr based on both current and historical data 
the completeness and accuracy of data received by cedants on assumed business that we do not manage directly is verified through monthly reconciliations to detailed statements  inception to date rollforwards of claim data  actuarial estimates of historical trends  field audits  and a series of management oversight reports on a program basis 
the following table sets forth our net case and ibnr reserves for losses and lae by line of business at december  in thousands net case net ibnr total workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total when a claim is reported to one of our insurance company subsidiaries  for the majority of claims  our claims personnel within our risk management subsidiary will establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment for a majority of our claims 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim  and meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments  new information or periodic reviews of the claims 
in addition to case reserves and in accordance with industry practice  we maintain estimates of reserves for losses and lae incurred but not yet reported 
we project an estimate of ultimate losses and lae at each reporting date 
the difference between the projected ultimate loss and lae reserves and the case loss reserves and lae reserves  is carried as ibnr reserves 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we estimate the ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverables 
our reserves are reviewed by internal and independent actuaries for adequacy on a quarterly basis 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various factors such as per claim information  industry and our historical loss experience  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions we use in our selection of ultimate reserves include underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december  and reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses and lae  and amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr losses and lae 
such recoverables  by necessity  are based upon estimates 
reinsurance does not legally discharge us from our legal liability to our insureds  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
instead of being netted against the appropriate liabilities  ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and lae are reported separately as assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
reinsurance recoverable balances are also subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
in our selection of reinsurers  we continually evaluate their financial stability 
while we believe our reinsurance recoverables are collectible  the ultimate recoverable may be greater or less than the amount accrued 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses were million and million  respectively 
in our risk sharing programs  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by our clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  or on the portion of risk either ceded to the captives  or retained by the clients 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors we consider upon entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
we collateralize balances due from our risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or stand by letters of credit issued by highly rated banks 
we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners  some of which are in litigation 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued potential exposure to uncollectibility 
at december   we believe this allowance is adequate 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from our risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations 
investments and other than temporary impairments of securities and unrealized losses on investments our investment securities are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are available to be sold in the future in response to our liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates  tax strategies and asset liability management strategies  among other reasons 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes and  accordingly  have no effect on net income 
however  if there is a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost and the decline is considered other than temporary  the amount of decline below cost is charged to earnings 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in debt securities classified as available for sale  with a concentration in fixed income securities of a high quality 
our investment philosophy is to maximize after tax earnings and maintain significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
our policy for the valuation of temporarily impaired securities is to determine impairment based on analysis of  but not limited to  the following factors rating downgrade or other credit event eg  failure to pay interest when due  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology or discontinuance of a business segment  prospects for the issuer s industry segment  and intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in market value 
we evaluate our investments in securities to determine other than temporary impairment  no less than quarterly 
investments that are deemed other than temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated net fair value and the related losses recognized in income 
there were no impaired investments written down in   and there can be no assurance  however  that significant changes in the above factors in relation to our investment portfolio  will not result in future impairment charges 
at december  and  we had and securities that were in an unrealized loss position  respectively 
these investments all had unrealized losses of less than ten percent 
at december   of those investments  with an aggregate million and million fair value and unrealized loss  respectively  have been in an unrealized loss position for more than eighteen months 
at december   thirty nine of those investments  with an aggregate million and million fair value and unrealized loss  respectively  have been in an unrealized loss position for more than eighteen months 
as of december  and  gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities were million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition we recognize premiums written as earned on a pro rata basis over the life of the policy term 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of an in force policy 
provisions for unearned premiums on reinsurance assumed from others are made on the basis of ceding reports when received and actuarial estimates 
for the year ending december   total assumed written premiums were million  of which million  relates to assumed business we manage directly  and therefore  no estimation is involved 
the remaining million of assumed written premiums includes million related to residual markets 
assumed premium estimates are specifically related to the mandatory assumed pool business from the national council on compensation insurance ncci  or residual market business 
the pools cede meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued workers compensation business to participating companies based upon the individual company s market share by state 
the activity is reported from the ncci to participating companies on a two quarter lag 
to accommodate this lag  we estimate premium and loss activity based on historical and market based results 
historically  we have not experienced any material difficulties or disputes in collecting balances from ncci  and therefore  no provision for doubtful accounts is recorded related to the assumed premium estimate 
in addition  certain premiums are subject to retrospective premium adjustments 
premium is recognized over the term of the insurance contract 
fee income  which includes risk management consulting  loss control  and claims administration services  is recognized in the period the services are provided 
claims processing fees are recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the claims  or the estimated life of the contract 
for those contracts that provide services beyond the contractually defined termination date of the related contracts  fees are deferred in an amount equal to an estimate of our obligation to continue to provide services 
commission income  which includes reinsurance placement  is recorded on the later of the effective date or the billing date of the policies on which they were earned 
commission income is reported net of any sub producer commission expense 
any commission adjustments that occur subsequent to the earnings process are recognized upon notification from the insurance companies 
profit sharing commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determinable  which is when such commissions are received 
we review  on an ongoing basis  the collectibility of our receivables and establish an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts 
as of december  and  the allowance for uncollectibles on receivables was million and million  respectively 
legal contingencies we are subject at times to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings relating principally to alleged errors or omissions in the placement of insurance  claims administration  consulting services and other business transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 
where appropriate  we vigorously defend such claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
some of these claims  lawsuits and proceedings seek damages  including consequential  exemplary or punitive damages  in amounts that could  if awarded  be significant 
most of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by errors and omissions insurance or other appropriate insurance 
in terms of deductibles associated with such insurance  we have established provisions against these items  which are believed to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss is estimable  an accrual is provided for the costs to resolve these claims in our consolidated financial statements 
period expenses related to the defense of such claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we  with the assistance of outside counsel  adjust such provisions according to new developments or changes in the strategy in dealing with such matters 
on the basis of current information  we do not expect the outcome of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings to which we are subject to  either individually  or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of any such matters 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of subsidiaries acquired 
as required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill and  at least annually  we test all existing goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach  on a reporting unit basis 
our annual assessment date for goodwill impairment testing is october st 
we test for meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment to goodwill 
we carry goodwill on two reporting units within the agency operations segment in the amount of million and three reporting units within the specialty risk management operations segment in the amount of million 
based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill impairment  we determined that no impairment to goodwill exists 
results of operations executive overview overall underwriting results in continued to show improvement in comparison to our results for demonstrate our commitment to strong underwriting discipline  as well as improved profitability within our specialty insurance and fee for service programs 
net income for in comparison to is indicative of our selective growth consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines and controls over price adequacy 
we continued to achieve operational efficiencies and enhancements in as a result  our generally accepted accounting principles gaap combined ratio improved percentage points to in from in in may  we announced the affirmation of am best company s financial strength rating of b very good for three of our insurance company subsidiaries star insurance company star  savers property casualty insurance company  and williamsburg national insurance company 
concurrently  am best upgraded the rating of our other insurance company subsidiary  ameritrust insurance corporation  to b very good  from b very good 
additionally  am best upgraded the outlook for all the ratings from stable to positive 
a positive outlook is placed on a company s rating if its financial and market trends are favorable  relative to its current rating level 
gross written premium was down slightly in comparison to this slight decrease was primarily the result of exiting a limited number of small programs that no longer met our pricing standards  therefore reducing premium volume in certain limited programs in which pricing competition dictates that we write less volume and maintaining pricing discipline throughout the organization 
in addition  this decrease was the result of a reduction in audit related premiums 
we continue to follow pricing guidelines mandated by our corporate underwriting guidelines 
overall  our year to date rate change was relatively flat 
in  there were anticipated mandatory rate decreases in workers compensation in some states  but for the most part those were offset by benefit changes that should lower incurred losses 
we anticipate rates to remain relatively stable in we implemented several new programs in and continue to be selective on new program implementation by focusing on those that meet our underwriting guidelines and have a history of profitability 
our statutory surplus increased by million in to million  from million in in addition  we had positive cash flow from operations of million in  compared to million in compared to net income improved million  or  to million  or per diluted share  in  from net income of million  or per diluted share  in as previously indicated  this improvement is primarily the result of our selective growth consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines and our controls over price adequacy 
in addition  during we increased our retention levels on certain reinsurance treaties  which favorably impacted net earned premiums and net income for  compared to growth in our fee for service programs also contributed to the overall improvement in net income in comparison to revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects a million  or  increase in net meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued earned premiums 
the increase in net earned premiums is the result of our selective growth consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines and our controls over price adequacy  as well as the favorable impact from an increase in our retention levels on certain reinsurance treaties effective in offsetting the overall increase in net earned premiums for the year ended december   was a reduction in audit related premiums in comparison to the increase in revenue was also the result of an overall increase in fee for service revenue  primarily as a result of new managed programs 
in addition  the increase in revenue reflects a million increase in investment income  primarily due to an increase in average invested assets as a result of improved cashflow from favorable underwriting results  an increase in the duration of our reserves  and proceeds from the junior subordinated debentures issued in the third quarter of the increase in investment income is also the result of a slight increase in yield 
compared to net income improved million  or  to million  or per diluted share  in  from net income of million  or per diluted share  in this improvement was primarily the result of our controlled growth of premiums written  the impact from rate increases in and  overall expense initiatives  and the continued leveraging of fixed costs 
in addition  we increased our retention levels on certain reinsurance treaties  which favorably impacted net earned premiums and net income 
these improvements manifested  despite the favorable effect in the third quarter of  from the acceleration of million in deferred revenue  less approximately  in expenses and million in taxes  relating to the early termination of a specific multi state claims run off contract 
net income was also favorably impacted by approximately  from profit sharing commissions received in  partially offset by continuing expenses primarily related to implementation and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  net income was favorably impacted as a result of a  increase in the deferred tax asset relating to the increase in the statutory federal tax rate from to 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase reflected a million  or  increase in net earned premiums 
the increase in net earned premiums was the result of our controlled growth in written premiums from various existing programs and new programs implemented in  a higher retention on certain reinsurance treaties effective in  and the impact of an overall rate increase in partially offsetting these increases in revenue was an approximate million decrease in managed fee revenue  which was primarily the result of an acceleration of million in deferred claim fee revenue recognized in the third quarter of this comparative decrease in managed fee revenue in was due to the acceleration of deferred claim fee revenue in  as the result of an earlier than anticipated termination of two limited duration administrative services and multi state claims run off contracts 
these contracts had been terminated by the liquidator for the companies during the third quarter of therefore  the revenues that we anticipated earning in the first nine months of were accelerated into the third quarter of in addition  the increase in revenue reflected a million increase in investment income  primarily the result of an increase in average invested assets and a slight increase in yield

compared to revenues from specialty risk management operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in net earned premiums increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the comparable period in this increase is primarily the result of selective growth consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines and our controls over price adequacy  as well as the favorable impact from an increase in our retention levels on certain reinsurance treaties 
offsetting these increases was an overall decrease in audit related premiums in comparison to  reflecting improvements in the estimation of exposures during the underwriting cycle 
management fees increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase is primarily the result of a florida based program implemented in the second quarter of in addition  this increase is the result of growth in a specific new england based program 
also contributing to the overall increase in management fees was the recognition of  from a profit based revenue sharing payment related to a specific managed program 
claim fees increased million  or  to million  from million for the comparable period in this increase is primarily the result of our entry into the self insured workers compensation market in nevada

management s discussion and analysis continued from favorable underwriting results and an increase in the duration of our reserves 
the increase in the duration of our reserves reflects the impact of our public entity excess program  which was implemented at the end of this program has a longer duration than the average reserves on our remaining programs and is a larger proportion of reserves 
in addition  the million in net proceeds received from capital raised in through the issuances of debentures increased average invested assets 
the average investment yield for was  compared to in the current pre tax book yield was 
the current after tax book yield was  compared to in this increase is primarily the result of the shift in our investment portfolio to tax exempt investments 
the duration of the investment portfolio is years 
specialty risk management operations generated pre tax income of million for the year ended december   compared to pre tax income of million for the year ended december  this increase in pre tax income demonstrates a continued improvement in underwriting results as a result of our controlled growth in premium volume and our continued focus on leveraging of fixed costs 
the gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable period in net losses and loss adjustment expenses lae decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio improved percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated net loss and lae in relation to net earned premiums 
the accident year loss ratio remained flat at for  compared to in the favorable development in our loss ratio was primarily the result of improvement in frequency and claim settlements within the professional liability line of business 
in addition  workers compensation residual market experience improved as a result of lower market share assessments and lower loss reserves on the industry pooled experience 
both and  were adversely impacted by a single large workers compensation claim 
the increase was million and  in and  respectively 
excluding the adverse impact of this claim  overall workers compensation reflected improvement in claim settlements relative to their collective case reserves 
the experience within the general liability line of business also improved due to favorable case reserve settlements in  in comparison to these improvements were partially offset by a single property claim of million within a california based agricultural program 
allowances within other reserve categories  collectively  did not contribute to the development in  compared to where we experienced approximately million in adverse development related to allowances on reinsurance recoverables 
additional discussion of our reserve activity is described below within the other items reserves section 
our expense ratio for the year ended december  was  compared to in this ratio is the unconsolidated policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in relation to net earned premiums 
the increase in our expense ratio in comparison to reflects a reduction in an accrual for estimated profit based ceding commissions on an excess reinsurance treaty for a specific commercial transportation program 
this decrease was the result of unfavorable loss development on a limited number of excess of loss claims from prior accident years and added million to our expenses  or percentage points to our expense ratio for the year  as compared to a favorable impact on the expense ratio of million  or percentage points 
as of december   the remaining accrual was less than  therefore  we do not anticipate any further unfavorable adjustments 
offsetting this increase in the expense ratio was a reduction in insurance related assessments primarily related to the guaranty fund in florida and nevada

management fees increased  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in management fees were impacted by an anticipated shift in fee for service revenue previously generated from a third party contract to internally generated fee revenue from a specific renewal rights agreement that is eliminated upon consolidation 
due to the earlier than anticipated termination of this third party contract  the revenues we anticipated earning in were accelerated into the third quarter of excluding revenue generated from this third party contract  management fee revenue increased approximately million  or  in comparison to this increase was primarily the result of a new florida based program implemented in the second quarter of  as well as growth in a specific existing new england based program 
claim fees decreased million  or  to million  from million for the comparable period in this decrease reflected a similar anticipated shifting of revenue previously generated from a multi state claims run off service contract  to internally generated fee revenue from a specific renewal rights agreement that is eliminated upon consolidation 
also impacting this comparison was the effect of the earlier than anticipated termination of the third party contract  which caused the revenues we anticipated earning in to be accelerated into the third quarter of excluding revenue generated from this third party contract  claim fee revenue would have remained relatively consistent in comparison to net investment income increased million  or  to million in  from million in average invested assets increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in average invested assets reflected cash flows from underwriting activities and growth in gross written premiums during and  as well as net proceeds from capital raised in and through the issuances of debentures

offsetting a portion of this improvement  was a million pre tax benefit  recognized in the third quarter of  from the previously mentioned acceleration of revenue recognition  net of expenses  relating to the termination of a specific multi state claims run off contract 
the gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable period in net losses and loss adjustment expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio improved percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated net loss and lae in relation to net earned premiums 
the accident year loss ratio improved percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this overall improvement in the loss ratio reflects the impact of earned premiums from the controlled growth of profitable programs which had favorable underwriting experience  as well as our intended shift in our mix of business between workers compensation and general liability 
historically  the general liability line of business has a lower loss ratio and a higher external producer commission 
in addition  the loss ratio was favorably impacted as a result of efficiencies realized in our claims handling activities 
these improvements were partially offset by a single large workers compensation claim of  as well as an increase to an exposure allowance of million  specific to reinsurance recoverables for a discontinued meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued surety program and a discontinued workers compensation program

our expense ratio was impacted by an anticipated increase in gross external commissions  due to the shift in our mix of business between workers compensation and general liability 
the general liability line of business has a higher external producer commission rate and  as previously indicated  a lower loss ratio 
offsetting these increases to the expense ratio was the impact of the leveraging of fixed costs 
agency operations the following table sets forth the revenues and results from operations from our agency operations in thousands for the years ended december  net commission pre tax income our agency operations include an allocation of corporate overhead  which includes expenses associated with accounting  information services  legal  and other corporate services 
the corporate overhead allocation excludes those expenses specific to the holding company 
for the years ended december    and  the allocation of corporate overhead to the agency operations segment was million  million  and million  respectively 
compared to revenue from agency operations  which consists primarily of agency commission revenue  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase is primarily the result of the november acquisition of a florida based retail agency and an increase in profit sharing commissions in comparison to offsetting these increases was a decrease in commission revenue as a result of a reduction in premium on client renewals 
agency operations generated pre tax income  after the allocation of corporate overhead  of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in this decrease in pre tax income in comparison to is primarily the result of a slight increase in operating expenses coupled with the decrease in commission revenue noted above as a result of the reduction in premium on client renewals  offset by the favorable impact from the florida based retail agency acquisition 
compared to revenue from agency operations  which consists primarily of agency commission revenue  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase was primarily the result of profit sharing commissions received in the first and third quarter of in addition  the agency operations experienced an increase in new business and renewal retentions in comparison to  which was partially offset by a reduction in renewal rates 
agency operations generated pre tax income  after the allocation of corporate overhead  of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the improvement in the pre tax margin was primarily attributable to the overall increase in commissions and leveraging of fixed costs 
excluding fixed costs and the allocation of corporate overhead  all other expenses remained relatively consistent

management s discussion and analysis continued other items reserves at december   our best estimate for the ultimate liability for loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  was million 
we established a reasonable range of reserves of approximately million to million 
this range was established primarily by considering the various indications derived from standard actuarial techniques and other appropriate reserve considerations 
the following table sets forth this range by line of business in thousands minimum reserve maximum reserve line of business range range selected reserves workers compensation commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total net reserves includes residual markets reserves are reviewed by internal and independent actuaries for adequacy on a quarterly basis 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of numerous factors such as per claim information  industry and our historical loss experience  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions used in our selection of ultimate reserves included the underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december    and for the year ended december   we reported a decrease in net ultimate loss estimates for accident years and prior of million  or of million of net loss and lae reserves at december  the decrease in net ultimate loss estimates reflected revisions in the estimated reserves as a result of actual claims activity in calendar year that differed from the projected activity 
there were no significant meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued changes in the key assumptions utilized in the analysis and calculations of our reserves during and the major components of this change in ultimate loss estimates are as follows in thousands incurred losses paid losses reserves at reserves at december  current prior total current prior december  line of business year years incurred year years total paid workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other net reserves reinsurance recoverable consolidated re estimated development reserves at as a reserves at december  percentage of december  on prior year line of business prior years reserves workers compensation commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other sub total residual markets total net reserves workers compensation excluding residual markets the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the workers compensation line of business  excluding residual markets  decreased  or of net workers compensation reserves 
this net overall decrease reflects decreases of  million  and  in the ultimate loss estimates for accident years   and  respectively 
these decreases reflect better than expected experience for many of our workers compensation programs  including a nevada program  a florida program  a tennessee program  and an alabama program 
average severity on reported claims did not increase as much as anticipated in the prior actuarial projections so ultimate loss estimates were reduced 
these decreases were offset by increases of million   and  in the ultimate loss estimate for accident years   and  respectively 
these increases reflect some large claim activity and case reserve strengthening primarily related to a massachusetts program and a large claim in a florida program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
commercial multiple peril general liability the commercial multiple peril line and general liability line of business had an increase in net ultimate loss estimates of  or of net commercial multiple peril and general liability reserves 
the net increase reflects increases of   and  in the ultimate loss estimates for accident years   and  respectively 
these increases reflect greater than expected claim activity within a meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued california program and a missouri program 
these increases also reflect a large settlement in an inactive national program 
these increases were offset by decreases of  and  in accident years and  respectively 
these decreases reflect better than expected claim emergence in a california program and the aforementioned missouri program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
commercial automobile the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the commercial automobile line of business increased  or of net commercial automobile reserves 
this net overall increase reflects increases of million and  in accident years and  respectively 
these increases reflect higher than expected emergence of claim activity in two california based programs 
these increases were offset by decreases of million and  in accident years and  respectively 
these decreases reflect better than expected claim emergence within a california based program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
other the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the other lines of business decreased million  or of net reserves 
this net decrease reflects a reduction of million in accident year this decrease is due to better than expected case reserve development in a medical malpractice program  offset by an increase of  in accident year this increase in accident year is the result of a claim within a specific california based program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
residual markets the workers compensation residual market line of business had a decrease in net ultimate loss estimates of  or of net reserves 
this decrease reflects reductions of million   and  in accident years   and  respectively 
offsetting these decreases was an increase of million in accident year we record loss reserves as reported by the national council on compensation insurance ncci  plus a provision for the reserves incurred but not yet analyzed and reported to us due to a two quarter lag in reporting 
these changes reflect a difference between our estimate of the lag incurred but not reported and the amounts reported by the ncci in the quarter 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
salary and employee benefits salary and employee benefits increased million  or  to million in  from million for the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects an increase in variable compensation 
in addition  this increase is the result of an increase in staffing levels  primarily as a result of the recent additions of our florida based retail agency and our entry into the self insured workers compensation market in nevada 
excluding those additions  overall staffing levels for were slightly higher in comparison to salary and employee benefits decreased  or  to million in  from million for the comparable period in this decrease primarily reflected a decrease in variable compensation  as a result of raising the performance targets for achievement 
this decrease was partially offset by merit increases for associates 
in addition  this decrease was partially due to a slight reduction in staffing levels in comparison to as a result of our expense control initiatives 
additional discussion of our variable compensation plan is described below under variable compensation 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued other administrative expenses other administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in a portion of this increase is the result of the expenses associated with the additions of our florida based agency and our entry into the self insured workers compensation market in nevada 
as revenues increase in these two locations we expect to see margins improve 
in addition  the increase in other administrative expenses is the result of information technology enhancements and various increases in other general operating expenses in comparison to other administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase was primarily attributable to consulting and audit expenses associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act  as well as increases in expenses as the result of information technology enhancements 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in bad debt expense as a result of overall refinements in our estimation for allowances on bad debt 
the increase in other administrative expenses was also offset by our overall expense control initiatives 
salary and employee benefits and other administrative expenses include both corporate overhead and the holding company expenses included in the non allocated expenses of our segment information 
interest expense interest expense for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
interest expense is primarily attributable to our debentures and current lines of credit  which are described within the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis 
the increase in interest expense was related to the issuance of the senior debentures issued in the second quarter of and the junior subordinated debentures issued in the third quarter of  as well as an overall increase in the average interest rates 
the average outstanding balance on our lines of credit was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the average interest rate  excluding our debentures  was approximately   and  in   and  respectively  primarily as a result of increases in the underlying eurocurrency based rate 
income taxes income tax expense  which includes both federal and state taxes  for  and  was million  million  and million  or  and of income before taxes  respectively 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to a shift towards increasing investments in tax exempt securities in an effort to maximize after tax investment yields 
our current and deferred taxes are calculated using a statutory rate 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds  which include both regulated and non regulated cash flows  are insurance premiums  investment income  proceeds from the maturity and sale of invested assets  risk management fees  and agency commissions 
funds are primarily used for the payment of claims  commissions  salaries and employee benefits  other operating expenses  shareholders dividends  share repurchases  and debt service 
our regulated sources of funds are insurance premiums  investment income  and proceeds from the maturity and sale of invested assets 
these regulated funds are used for the payment of claims  policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses  and taxes relating to the regulated portion of net income 
our non regulated sources of funds are in the form of commission revenue  outside management fees  and intercompany management fees 
our capital resources include both non regulated cash flow and excess capital in our insurance company subsidiaries  which is defined as the dividend star may issue without prior approval from our regulators 
we review the excess capital in aggregate to determine the use of such capital 
the general uses are as follows  meadowbrook insurance group  inc

this decrease was slightly offset as a result of improved underwriting results  lower paid losses in proportion to incurred losses  and an increase in investment income 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued non regulated subsidiaries cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the comparable period in this decrease in cash flow in comparison to was primarily the result of a decrease in net income 
the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures issued in the third quarter of and an overall increase in the average interest rates 
in addition  the decrease in net income was the result of an increase in administrative costs related to the additions of our florida based agency and our entry into the self insured workers compensation market in nevada  as well as an increase due to information technology enhancements 
these increases were offset by an overall increase in fee for service and agency commission revenue 
we continue to anticipate a temporary increase in cash outflows related to our investments in technology as we enhance our operating systems and controls 
we believe these temporary increases will not affect our liquidity  debt covenants  or other key financial measures 
compared to regulated subsidiaries cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the comparable period in this increase was the result of improved underwriting results and an increase in investment income  offset by a tax benefit reduction from the utilization of the net operating loss carryforward in non regulated subsidiaries cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in non regulated cash flow from operations reflected the decrease in net income  which was primarily the result of the previously mentioned acceleration of revenue  recognized in the third quarter of in addition  the decrease in net income was the result of an increase in administrative costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  offset by an increase in revenue associated with profit sharing commissions 
in addition  the decrease in cash flow from operations was the result of variable compensation payments made in the first quarter of  related to performance and profitability and a decrease in cash as a result of tax payments 
in addition to the changes described above in relation to our cash provided by operations  we had an increase in cash used in investing activities as a result of an million cash payment for our new corporate headquarters in the first quarter of the proceeds from the issuance of debentures  which are described below  were used for the purchase of our new building

associated with the issuance of the above long term debt we incurred approximately million in issuance costs for commissions paid to the placement agents in the transactions 
these issuance costs have been capitalized and are included in other assets on the balance sheet  which are being amortized over seven years as a component of interest expense 
the seven year amortization period represents our best estimate of the estimated useful life of the bonds related to both the senior debentures and junior subordinated debentures 
the junior subordinated debentures issued in and  were issued in conjunction with the issuance of million and million in mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities to a trust formed by an institutional investor from our unconsolidated subsidiary trusts  respectively 
with the five year period approaching in for the junior subordinated debentures issued in  we will be reviewing the capital strategy associated with refinancing at lower costs through debentures or equity 
interest rate swaps in october  we entered into two interest rate swap transactions to mitigate our interest rate risk on million and million of our senior debentures and trust preferred securities  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these interest rate swap transactions were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and the effective portion of the changes in fair value are accounted for within other comprehensive income 
the interest differential to be paid or received is accrued and is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the first interest rate swap transaction  which relates to million of our million issuance of senior debentures  has an effective date of october  and an ending date of may  we are required to make certain quarterly fixed rate payments calculated on a notional amount of million  non amortizing  based on a fixed annual interest rate of

we use the revolving line of credit to meet short term working capital needs 
under the revolving line of credit  we and certain of our non regulated subsidiaries pledged security interests in certain property and assets of named subsidiaries 
at december  and  we had an outstanding balance of million and million  respectively  on the revolving line of credit 
the revolving line of credit provides for interest at a variable rate based  at our option  upon either a prime based rate or libor based rate 
in addition  the revolving line of credit also provides for an unused facility fee 
on prime based borrowings  the applicable margin ranges from to basis points below prime 
on libor based borrowings  the applicable margin ranges from to basis points above libor 
the margin for all loans is dependent on the sum of non regulated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and non cash impairment charges related to intangible assets for the preceding four quarters  plus dividends paid or payable to us from subsidiaries during such period adjusted ebitda

of these shares   shares for a total cost of approximately  related to the current share repurchase plan 
as of december   the cumulative amount we repurchased and retired under our current share repurchase plan was  shares of common stock for a total cost of approximately  as of december   we have available up to  shares remaining to be purchased 
our board of directors did not declare a dividend in or when evaluating the declaration of a dividend  our board of directors considers a variety of factors  including but not limited to  our cash flow  liquidity needs  results of operations and our overall financial condition 
as a holding company  the ability to pay cash dividends is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries 
we did not receive any dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries in or regulatory a significant portion of our consolidated assets represent assets of our insurance company subsidiaries 
the state of michigan office of financial and insurance services ofis  restricts the amount of funds that may be transferred to us in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
these restrictions in general  are as follows the maximum discretionary dividend that may be declared  based on data from the preceding calendar year  is the greater of each insurance company s net income excluding realized capital gains or ten percent of the insurance company s surplus excluding unrealized gains 
these dividends are further limited by a clause in the michigan law that prohibits an insurer from declaring dividends except out of surplus earnings of the company 
earned surplus balances are calculated on a quarterly basis 
since star is the parent insurance company  its maximum dividend calculation represents the combined insurance company subsidiaries surplus 
at december   star s earned surplus position was positive million 
at december   star had negative earned surplus of million 
based upon the december  statutory financial statements  star may pay a dividend of up to million without the prior approval of ofis 
no statutory dividends were paid in or refer to the liquidity and capital resources section above for a description of the potential uses of such dividends 
our insurance company subsidiaries are required to maintain certain deposits with regulatory authorities  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively

the loss and loss adjustment expense payments do not have contractual maturity dates and the exact timing of payments cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  based upon historical payment patterns  we have included an estimate of our gross losses and loss adjustment expenses 
in addition  we have anticipated cash receipts on reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  of which we estimate that these payments to be paid for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the periods less than one year  one to three years  three to five years  and more than five years  to be million  million  million  and million  respectively  resulting in net losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  million  million  and million  respectively 
we maintain an investment portfolio with varying maturities that we believe will provide adequate cash for the payment of claims 
variable compensation we have established two variable compensation plans as an incentive for performance of our management team 
they consist of an annual bonus plan bonus plan and a long term incentive plan ltip 
the bonus plan is a discretionary cash bonus plan premised upon a targeted growth in net after tax earnings on a year over year basis 
each year  the compensation committee and our board of directors establish a new target based upon prior year performance and the forecasted performance levels anticipated for the following year 
if the minimum threshold is met  the bonus plan is funded from up to a maximum of of the targeted bonus pool 
the amount of the bonus pool is established by aggregating the individual targets for each participant  which is a percentage of salary 
at the end of the year  the compensation committee and the board of directors review the company s performance in relation to performance targets and then establish the total bonus pool to be utilized to pay cash bonuses to the management team based upon overall corporate and individual participant goals 
the ltip is intended to provide an incentive to management to improve the performance of the company over a three year period  thereby increasing shareholder value 
the ltip is not discretionary and is meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued based upon a target for an average three year return on beginning equity 
if the targets are met and all other terms and conditions are satisfied  the ltip awards are paid 
the ltip can be funded from to of target  based upon the three year performance of the company 
the ltip is paid in cash and in stock 
a participant s percentage is established by the compensation committee and the board of directors in advance of any new three year ltip award 
the stock component of the ltip is paid based upon the closing stock price at the beginning of the three year ltip performance period  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ltip 
both the bonus plan and the ltip are administered by the compensation committee and all awards are reviewed and approved by the board of directors at both inception and at distribution 
regulatory and rating issues insurance operations are subject to various leverage tests eg premium to statutory surplus ratios  which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies 
our targets for gross and net written premium to statutory surplus are to and to  respectively 
as of december   on a statutory consolidated basis  gross and net premium leverage ratios were to and to  respectively 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action 
in general  an insurance company must submit a calculation of its rbc formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
these laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s rbc declines 
the level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding 
the rbc model act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of the company s total adjusted capital  defined as the total of its statutory capital  surplus and asset valuation reserve  to its risk based capital 
at december   all of the insurance company subsidiaries were in compliance with rbc requirements 
star reported statutory surplus of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the calculated rbc was million in and million in the threshold requiring the minimum regulatory involvement was million in and million in the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more ratios generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in  our insurance company subsidiaries generated one ratio that varied from the usual value range 
the variation and reason for this variation is set forth below ratio usual range value company williamsburg gross agents balances to policyholders surplus under the gross agents balances to policyholders surplus on williamsburg was impacted by the intercompany reinsurance agreement  which is described below under intercompany pooling agreement 
williamsburg s assumed premium receivable increased million as a result of intercompany pooling 
excluding the intercompany pooling  this ratio would have been within the usual range for in may  we announced the affirmation of am best company s financial strength rating of b very good for three of our insurance company subsidiaries star insurance company star  savers property casualty insurance company  and williamsburg national insurance company 
concurrently  am best upgraded the rating of our other insurance company subsidiary  ameritrust insurance corporation  to b very good  from b very good 
additionally  am best upgraded the outlook for all the ratings from stable to positive 
a positive outlook is placed on a company s rating if its financial and market trends are favorable  relative to its current rating level 
reinsurance considerations we seek to manage the risk exposure of our insurance company subsidiaries and our clients through the purchase of excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
our reinsurance requirements are analyzed on a specific program basis to determine the appropriate retention levels and reinsurance coverage limits 
we secure this reinsurance based on the availability  cost  and benefits of various reinsurance alternatives 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of risks assumed under insurance policies it issues  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
therefore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
we manage our credit risk on reinsurance recoverables by reviewing the financial stability  am best rating  capitalization  and credit worthiness of prospective and existing risk sharing partners 
we customarily collateralize reinsurance balances due from non admitted reinsurers through funds withheld trusts or stand by letters of credit issued by highly rated banks 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting reinsurance recoverables other than those balances related to three unaffiliated insurance companies  which are under regulatory liquidation or control  for which allowances have been established

management s discussion and analysis continued we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential exposure to uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
the following table sets forth our exposure to uncollectible reinsurance and related allowances for the years ending december  and in thousands gross exposure collateral or other security allowance net exposure intercompany pooling agreement intercompany pooling agreements are commonly entered into between affiliated insurance companies  so as to allow the companies to utilize the capital and surplus of all of the companies  rather than each individual company 
under pooling arrangements  companies share in the insurance business that is underwritten and allocate the combined premium  losses and related expenses between the companies within the pooling arrangement 
the insurance company subsidiaries entered into an inter company reinsurance agreement the pooling agreement 
this pooling agreement includes star  ameritrust insurance corporation ameritrust  savers property and casualty insurance company savers and williamsburg national insurance company williamsburg 
pursuant to the pooling agreement  savers  ameritrust and williamsburg have agreed to cede to star and star has agreed to reinsure of the liabilities and expenses of savers  ameritrust and williamsburg  relating to all insurance and reinsurance policies issued by them 
in return  star agrees to cede and savers  ameritrust and williamsburg have agreed to reinsure star for their respective percentages of the liabilities and expenses of star 
annually  we examine the pooling agreement for any changes to the ceded percentage for the liabilities and expenses 
any changes to the pooling agreement must be submitted to the applicable regulatory authorities for approval 
convertible note in july  we made a million loan  at an effective interest rate equal to the three month libor  plus  to an unaffiliated insurance agency 
in december  we loaned an additional million to the unaffiliated insurance agency 
the original million demand note was replaced with a million convertible note 
the effective interest rate of the convertible note is equal to the three month libor  plus and is due december  this agency has been a producer for us for over ten years

management s discussion and analysis continued related party transactions at december  and  respectively  we held an  and  note receivable  including  of accrued interest at december   from one of our executive officers 
accrued interest at december  was  this note arose from a transaction in late in which we loaned the officer funds to exercise  common stock options to cover the exercise price and the taxes incurred as a result of the exercise 
the note bears interest equal to our borrowing rate and is due on demand any time after january  the loan is partially collateralized by  shares of our common stock under a stock pledge agreement 
for the years ended december  and   and  respectively  have been paid against the accrued interest on the loan 
on june   the officer entered into an employment agreement which provides the note is a non recourse loan and our sole legal remedy in the event of a default is the right to reclaim the shares pledged under the stock pledge agreement 
as of december   the cumulative amount that has been paid against this loan was  refer to note related party transaction for further information

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk 
the following is a discussion of our primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  our market risk sensitive instruments are primarily related to fixed income securities  which are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is managed within the context of an asset and liability management strategy where the target duration for the fixed income portfolio is based on the estimate of the liability duration and takes into consideration our surplus 
the investment policy guidelines provide for a fixed income portfolio duration of between three and a half and five and a half years 
at december   our fixed income portfolio had a modified duration of  compared to at december  at december   the fair value of our investment portfolio was million 
our market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with debt securities 
our exposure to equity price risk is not significant 
our investment philosophy is one of maximizing after tax earnings and has historically included significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
during and  we continued to increase our holdings of tax exempt securities based on our return to profitability and our desire to maximize after tax investment income 
for our investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  we do not anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect 
a sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values  or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonable possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in our sensitivity model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss of debt securities assuming an upward parallel shift in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair values 
the table below presents our meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued model s estimate of changes in fair values given a change in interest rates 
dollar values are rounded and in thousands 
rates down bps rates unchanged rates up bps market value yield to maturity or call effective duration the other financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  equity securities  premium receivables  reinsurance recoverables  line of credit and other assets and liabilities  when included in the sensitivity model  do not produce a material loss in fair values 
our debentures are subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on these debentures is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december  and  we had debentures of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  in october  we entered into two interest rate swap transactions to mitigate our interest rate risk on million and million of our senior debentures and trust preferred securities  respectively 
we accrue for these transactions in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as subsequently amended 
these interest rate swap transactions have been designated as a cash flow hedges and are deemed highly effective hedges under sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 these interest rate swap transactions are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and the effective portion of any changes in fair value are accounted for within other comprehensive income 
the interest differential to be paid or received is being accrued and is being recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
in addition  our revolving line of credit under which we can borrow up to million is subject to variable interest rates 
this line of credit expires november we plan to renew the line of credit upon its expiration and will be evaluating the renewal terms based upon our overall capital strategy 
thus  our interest expense on the revolving line of credit is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december   we had million outstanding on this revolving line of credit 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would have changed interest expense by  at december   we had million outstanding on this revolving line of credit 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would have changed interest expense by
