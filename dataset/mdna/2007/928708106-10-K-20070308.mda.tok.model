item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  develop  and market proprietary  high performance analog and mixed signal power management semiconductors 
we sell integrated voltage regulator semiconductors and scalable voltage regulator semiconductor chipsets in the computing  storage  networking  and consumer markets 
we commenced operations in from to  we were primarily involved in developing our technology  recruiting personnel and raising capital 
we made our first commercial shipments of products in and began to recognize revenue in the first quarter of our annual net revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in  we generated net income of million compared to million in in reviewing our performance  we focus on the following key non financial factors customers and market penetration  product introductions and product performance 
we evaluate our performance as to these non financial factors against our internally developed goals 
we also focus on the following key financial factors net revenue  and as a percentage of net revenue  gross margin excluding stock based compensation  and income from operations excluding stock based compensation 
we base management compensation in part on our net revenue and income from operations excluding stock based compensation 
though not a replacement for gaap measures of financial performance  we believe evaluating our ongoing operating results and in particular  making comparisons to similar companies  may be difficult if limited to reviewing only gaap financial measures 
in addition  because discounting 
table of contents future cash flows is a widely accepted method to value assets  and because the amounts of stock based compensation expense represent permanent differences between income and cash flow  we believe it is useful to consider gross margin and income from operations without the effect of this non cash item 
the following table summarizes these key financial factors over the last five quarters three months ended dec  sep  jun  mar  dec  net revenue in thousands as a percent of net revenue gaap gross margin add stock based compensation non gaap gross margin gaap income from operations add stock based compensation non gaap income from operations stock based compensation did not have an effect as a percent of revenue 
when evaluating our net revenue  we categorize our sales into four major market segments servers and storage  desktop and workstation  networking and communications  and consumer and portable 
the electronics manufacturing industry is complex and disaggregated  and electronic system designers typically rely upon distributors and outsourced suppliers to provide procurement  manufacturing  design and other supply chain related services within the industry 
we attempt to quantify the amount of sales within the major markets identified above  but such quantified amounts are approximations only  as we must rely upon estimates or assumptions regarding the actual incorporation of our products sold to distributors or other outsourced suppliers into the systems of the original equipment manufacturers  or oems  original design manufacturers  or odms  contract equipment manufacturers  or cems  or merchant power supply manufacturers for each particular market 
in the fourth quarter of  we estimate that of our net revenue was derived from sales in the server and storage market  from the workstation and desktop market and from the networking and communications market 
in the third quarter of  we estimate that of our net revenue was derived from sales in the server and storage market  from the workstation and desktop market and from the networking and communications market 
in the fourth quarter of  we estimate that of our net revenue was derived from sales in the server and storage market  from the workstation and desktop market and from the networking and communications market 
our sales and accounts receivable are concentrated with a small group of customers 
in  ibm  metatech and sabre each accounted for more than of our net revenue  and collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
in  ibm  internix  lite on technologies  metatech and sabre each accounted for more than of our net revenue  and collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
while we report revenue for direct sales to particular customers  our sales data may not accurately reflect the total demand generated by those significant customers  given that such customers may also be responsible for additional indirect demand from distributors and outsourced suppliers like odms  cems  and merchant power supply manufacturers who purchase our products pursuant to their business relationships with such significant customers 
our sales data also may not identify customers who may be significant  despite not directly accounting for of our net revenue  in that such customers may also generate significant indirect demand from these distributors and outsourced suppliers 
if any such significant customer were to stop incorporating our products or third party products containing our components into its designs  we would not only lose the direct revenue we receive from the significant customer  but we could also lose a portion of the revenue from third parties who do business with such significant customer 
if we were to lose or experience a significant reduction in demand from one or more of our key customers either to which 
table of contents we sell directly or which generates demand at an intermediary or if we were to fail to timely collect our accounts receivable from one or more of our key customers  our operating results and financial position would be materially adversely impacted 
because demand for our products is influenced by demand for our customers products  our revenue will depend on the timing  size  and speed of commercial introductions of systems that use our products  which is inherently difficult to forecast  as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced systems 
a number of our customers applications  particularly in the desktop and workstation markets  are subject to short product cycles and prone to significant changes in demand  making it inherently difficult to accurately forecast demand for such applications and in any period  fluctuations in demand could materially affect our operating results 
in addition  demand for our products is influenced by our customers management of their own inventory 
we believe that currently we are experiencing a decrease in demand for our products due to a significant customer holding inventory in excess of current demand which will materially adversely impact our near term operating results 
our sales to distributors and outsourced suppliers such as odms  cems  and merchant power supply manufacturers  are subject to higher risk and may be more volatile because they service demand from other companies which is more difficult to forecast accurately 
a portion of our revenues come from orders received and shipped against within the same quarter  or turns business  which is inherently difficult to forecast 
we estimate turns business as a percent of net revenue as the ratio of net revenue less beginning backlog to net revenue making adjustment for the effect of sales return reserves or other adjustments to net revenue not included in backlog 
turns business was between and of net revenue in the fourth quarter of  compared to turns business between and of net revenue in third quarter of and between and of net revenue in the fourth quarter of we believe our turns business will increase in the first quarter of as our turns business increases  forecasting revenue becomes more difficult 
the sales of our products are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
generally  our current practice allows customers to  and customers routinely do  revise and cancel orders and reschedule delivery dates on relatively short notice pursuant to changes in the customer s requirements 
in addition  in circumstances where we have achieved our objectives in a period or when we have limited or insufficient inventory available  we may delay shipment of orders 
for these reasons  backlog has limited value as a predictor of future revenues 
in addition  in the future  we may enter into longer term agreements with our customers  which may contain other terms and conditions that are more burdensome to us or that may create additional potential liabilities for us 
while our limited operating history and recent growth make it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business  we expect our business to be subject to varying order patterns 
we tend to experience a seasonally strong fourth quarter due to year end purchasing of electronic equipment 
in addition  over time we expect more of our revenue to come from consumer oriented applications 
in these applications  we expect a disproportionate amount of our net revenue to be generated during the second half of the year as a result of the december holiday season 
we tend to experience a seasonally weak first quarter due to the lunar new year holiday in asia  during which time many of our customers  manufacturers  and subcontractors cease or significantly reduce their operations 
we typically sell directly through our internal sales force to customers in north america 
we sell both directly and indirectly through distributors internationally 
during the fourth quarter of  sales to international distributors represented of net revenue  compared to in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of we expect the sales channels we use and the mix of business between distribution and direct sales to change over time as our product offerings and customers evolve 
our sales through distributors typically result in lower gross margins  but also result in lower selling and collections expenses than are associated with direct sales 
our gross margins have historically varied significantly  and may continue to vary  based on a variety of factors  including changes in the relative mix of the products we sell  the markets and geographies where we sell  the size and nature of our customers in these markets  the levels of sales to distributors  new product ramps  manufacturing volumes and yields  and inventory and overhead costs 
in particular  as we work to reduce the high inventory levels we held at the end of the fourth quarter of we will experience higher overhead costs which will adversely influence gross margins in in addition  consistent with the overall market for power 
table of contents management solutions  we expect to face price pressure over time 
in order to maintain or improve our gross margins  we will need to introduce new  lower cost products  increase volumes  reduce unit costs or achieve a combination of these objectives 
we purchase our inventory pursuant to standard purchase orders 
as lead times at our manufacturing vendors can be up to three months or more  we typically build inventory based on our sales forecasts rather than customers orders  subjecting us to inventory risk and  in the event of an inventory write down either because the inventory exceeds demand  becomes obsolete  or contains undetected errors and must be scrapped  a potential material adverse impact on our cost of revenue and gross margins 
on the other hand  because our manufacturing lead times tend to be longer than our order lead times and capacity at our manufacturing vendors may be constrained  our net revenue and relationship with our customers could be adversely impacted if we do not have adequate inventory available to meet customer demand 
our inventory levels increased to million at december  and inventory turns  calculated as our annualized cost of revenue for the quarter divided by our inventory as of the end of such quarter  decreased to turns in the fourth quarter of compared to turns in the third quarter of and turns in the fourth quarter of as the amount of inventory we are holding increases or our inventory turns decrease  the risk of a potential inventory write down and adverse impact on our gross margins increases 
while in any period there may be fluctuations in our operating results  we expect total operating expenses generally to grow in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of net revenue over time 
in the near term however  we expect operating expenses to increase as a percentage of sales due to declining net revenues 
our research and development expenses can fluctuate as a result of long design cycles with periods of relatively low expenses punctuated with increased expenditures for prototypes and product development toward the end of the design cycle 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to grow as we invest in additional sales resources and continue to put in place the corporate infrastructure needed to support our growing operations 
our effective tax rate has fluctuated based on the mix of income and losses between domestic and foreign operations and changing assessments of statutory tax rates 
the effective tax rate on our domestic income is currently significantly lower than statutory rates because we utilize net operating loss carry forwards from which no previous benefit had been recognized to offset taxable income 
our domestic deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance because  based on the available objective evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realizable 
if we continue to have profitable domestic operations  we may revise this assessment  which could result in a favorable adjustment to reported income tax expense in the period of re assessment followed by higher reported tax rates in subsequent periods 
our foreign income is typically subject to lower statutory rates than our domestic income 
we expect that both our mix of income and losses as well as the statutory rates we are subject to internationally may change over time  resulting in increases in our effective tax rate and reported income tax expense 
net revenue 
net revenue consists primarily of sales of our power management semiconductor products 
we have made no sales to us distributors 
our sales to international distributors are made under agreements that do not provide for price adjustments after purchase and provide limited return rights in the event of product failure 
we recognize revenue on our sales upon shipment with a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of purchases of silicon wafers and related costs of assembly  test and shipment of our products  and compensation and related costs of personnel and equipment associated with production management and quality assurance 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs for employees involved in the design and development of our products  prototyping and other development expense  and the depreciation costs related to equipment being used for research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs for employees involved in general management  sales and marketing  finance  and information technology  as well as travel and entertainment expenses  professional services expenses  and insurance expenses 

table of contents income taxes 
income tax expense is based on our annual effective tax rate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our annual effective tax rate is based on the mix of income between domestic and international operations  as well as the utilization of available net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income in the us critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criterion is based on a purchase order received from the customer 
determination of criterion is based on shipment when title transfers to the customer 
determinations of criteria and are based on the fixed price charged for products delivered adjusted for any applicable discounts and management s judgment regarding the collectibility of the amounts billed 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment when title passes and a provision is made for estimated returns and allowances 
we have made no sales to us distributors 
us distributors typically receive sales price rebates and have inventory return privileges 
our sales to international distributors are made under agreements that do not provide for price adjustments after purchase and provide for limited return rights in the event of a product failure 
revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 
we track historical rates of return by identifying the period in which the returned products were originally shipped 
we then compute a historical sales return rate for prior quarterly periods 
to determine the estimated return rate for any period  this historical sales return rate is adjusted for unusual past returns experience related to specific quality issues or other unusual circumstances that are not expected to recur and consideration of any current information about known product failure rates or business developments 
based on this historical data as well as current business expectations  we estimate sales returns 
while we believe our methodology enables us to make reasonable estimates of sales returns  because of the inherent nature of estimates and our limited historical experience  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
a significant difference between actual amounts and our estimates could significantly impact our reported operating results 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis or market 
we record provisions for inventories for excess or obsolete work in process and finished goods 
newly developed products are generally not valued until they have been qualified for manufacturing and success in the marketplace has been demonstrated through sales and backlog  among other factors 
in addition to provisions based on newly introduced parts  statistical and judgmental assessments are made for the remaining inventory based on assumptions about future demand 
we identify excess and obsolete inventory by analyzing inventory aging  recent sales  order backlog  and demand forecasts 
based on these and other factors  we estimate on an individual product basis the net realizable value of our inventory 
net realizable value is determined as the forecast sales of the product less the estimated cost of disposal 
we reduce the carrying value to estimated net 
table of contents realizable value if it is less than standard cost 
while our estimates require us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future events  we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reliable estimates 
if actual market conditions and resulting product sales were to be less favorable than our projections  additional inventory provisions may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains  and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax strategies and to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we established a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets for all periods since inception 
if we continue to record profitable domestic operations  a reduction to our recorded valuation allowance may occur in future periods  which would likely result in an income tax benefit in the period of reduction and increase to our effective tax rate in subsequent periods 
stock based compensation 
prior to  we applied the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock based compensation as prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issues to employees  and related interpretations including financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  and interpretation of apb opinion no 
 to account for our stock options 
under this method  compensation expense was recorded only if the deemed fair value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price on the date of grant 
beginning in  we account for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under sfas no 
r  compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the grant 
for grants made prior to january   the compensation cost is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of each grant using the method prescribed by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or awards plans 
for grants made on or after january   the compensation cost is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
in the absence of an actively traded market for similar financial instruments to those being granted  estimating the fair value of stock based compensation is inherently difficult because the value of the financial instruments cannot be objectively verified even in retrospect 
we use the black scholes formula in estimating the fair value of stock based compensation at the date of grant 
the black scholes formula and sfas no 
r requires us to estimate key inputs to the formula such as expected term  volatility  and forfeiture rates that determine the stock based compensation expense 
we estimate these key inputs using historical information  peer company data and judgment regarding company specific and market factors and trends 
when estimating expected volatility  we consider the historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility on traded options on our stock 
however  due to the limited history of trading and lack of liquidity in both the market for our stock and options on our stock  we also consider the implied volatility on a group of peer companies to develop our estimates as well as other factors 
option grants typically vest over four years to provide long term compensation and a retention incentive to employees 
to estimate the expected term of options granted  we consider the contractual life and vesting period of 
table of contents the option  historical exercise behavior of our employees  and other factors 
if the estimates for these key inputs are changed over time  the amounts recorded for future stock based compensation arrangements may increase or decrease  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we may maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds  government treasury and agency securities 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
as of december   all of our short term investments were government treasury and agency securities and our cash equivalents were held in savings and money market accounts 
our sales outside the united states are principally transacted in us dollars  accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes 
to date  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations
