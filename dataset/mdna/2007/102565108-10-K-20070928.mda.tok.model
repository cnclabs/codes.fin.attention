quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our short term investments and certain cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage this risk by maintaining an investment portfolio of available for sale instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
the fair value of marketable debt securities held was  and  at july  and july   respectively 
the fair value of certain fixed rate debt securities will change depending on movements in interest rates
