overview we continued to experience increased demand for our clearinghouse services in  and we made significant steps to innovate and expand the range and value of the services that we provide to meet the evolving needs of the communications industry 
under our contracts to provide telephone number portability services in the united states  we processed million transactions  a growth of over we believe that this growth in transaction volume demonstrates strong demand for our services from numerous sources  including  most significantly  customers who have been upgrading to next generation technologies  such as internet protocol  or ip  systems  and the entry of new service providers 
in  we also saw significant demand for our services from content providers to market their products and services using us common short codes 
the growth in demand for our clearinghouse services led to the amendment and extension of our seven contracts with the north american portability management llc under which we provide telephone number portability and other clearinghouse services in the united states 
under these amendments  which we announced in september  these contracts now run until june pricing for  including volume based credits  remained unchanged 
for  pricing is per transaction regardless of transaction volume 
pricing from through the expiration of the contracts contains volume based pricing that ranges from per transaction to per transaction  with the precise effective rate being determined based on transaction volumes within the applicable calendar year

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during a fiscal period 
the securities and exchange commission considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected

we recognize revenue for this contract based on costs incurred plus a pro rata amount of the fixed fee

for our internet domain name services  we generate revenue for internet domain registrations  which generally have contract terms between one and ten years

following the acquisition of ultradns corporation in april  we generate revenue through internal and external managed domain name services 
our revenue consists of customer set up fees followed by transaction processing under contracts with terms ranging from one to three years 
customer set up fees are not considered a separate deliverable and are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
under our contracts to provide our managed domain name services  customers have contractually established monthly transaction volumes for which they are charged a recurring monthly fee

significant contracts we provide wireline and wireless number portability  implement the allocation of pooled blocks of telephone numbers and provide network management services pursuant to seven contracts with north american portability management llc  an industry group that represents all telecommunications service providers in the united states 
we recognize revenue under our contracts with north american portability management llc primarily on a per transaction basis 
the aggregate fees for transactions processed under these contracts are determined by the total number of transactions  and these fees are billed to telecommunications service providers based on their allocable share of the total transaction charges 
this allocable share is based on each respective telecommunications service provider s share of the aggregate end user services revenue of all us telecommunications service providers  as determined by the fcc 
on november   bellsouth corporation filed a petition seeking changes in the way our customers are billed for services provided by us under our contracts with north american portability management llc 
in response to the bellsouth petition  the fcc solicited comments from other interested parties 
as of february   the fcc had not indicated whether it will take any action based on this petition  and the bellsouth petition remains pending 
we do not believe that this proposed change to the manner in which we bill for services under these contracts would have a material impact on our customers demand for these services 
under our contracts  we also bill a revenue recovery collections  or rrc  fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers  which is available to us if any telecommunications service provider fails to pay its allocable share of total transactions charges 
if the rrc fee is insufficient for that purpose  these contracts also provide for the recovery of such differences from the remaining telecommunications service providers 
the per transaction pricing under these contracts provided for annual volume based credits that were earned on all transactions in excess of the pre determined annual volume threshold 
for and  the maximum aggregate volume based credit was million  which was applied via a reduction in per transaction pricing once the pre determined annual volume threshold was surpassed 
when the aggregate credit was fully satisfied  the per transaction pricing was restored to the prevailing contractual rate 
in both and  the pre determined annual transaction volume threshold under these contracts was exceeded  which resulted in the issuance of million of volume based credits for both years 
in september  we amended our contracts with north american portability management llc 
under these amended terms  there are no volume based credits that will be applied in or later fiscal periods 
contrasted to the application of volume based credits in and  billings in continued at the original contractual rate after the annual volume threshold was surpassed 
billings in excess of the discounted pricing were recorded as customer credits liability on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding reduction to revenue 
in the following year when the credits were applied to invoices rendered  customer credits were reduced with a corresponding credit to accounts receivable 
the annual pre determined volume threshold was surpassed in the fourth quarter of  resulting in the reduction of revenue and recognition of customer credits of million in the aggregate for further  as part of the amendments to these contracts in december  we agreed to apply the then current transaction fee retroactively to all transactions processed and granted credits totaling million 
these credits were applied to customer invoices over a month period beginning in january additionally  we obtained letters of credit totaling million in january to secure a portion of these customer credits 
as of december   none of these customer credits were outstanding 
service level standards pursuant to certain of our private commercial contracts  we are subject to service level standards and to corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
we record a provision for these performance related penalties when we become aware that required service levels that would trigger such a penalty have not been met  which results in a corresponding reduction of our revenue 
for more information regarding how we recognize revenue for each of our service categories  please see the discussion above under revenue recognition 
goodwill and intangible assets our acquisition of our business from the lockheed martin corporation in november as well as subsequent acquisitions resulted in the recording of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired  as well as other definite lived intangible assets 
under present accounting rules statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization  instead it is subject to impairment testing criteria 
other acquired definite lived intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives  although those with indefinite lives are not to be amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment  using a lower of cost or fair value approach 
we test for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would indicate the possibility of impairment 
the impairment review may require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance 
if such a review indicates that the assets are impaired  an expense would be recorded for the amount of the impairment  and the corresponding impaired assets would be reduced in carrying value 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if an indication of impairment is present  we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying amount 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
substantially all of our long lived assets are located in the united states 
accounts receivable  revenue recovery collections  and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
in accordance with our contracts with north american portability management llc  we bill an rrc fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers 
the aggregate rrc fees collected may be used to offset uncollectible receivables from an individual customer 
the rrc fees are recorded as an accrued liability when collected 
for the period from january  through june   this fee was of monthly billings 
on july   the rrc fee was reduced to 
on july   the rrc fee was reduced to 
any accrued rrc fees in excess of uncollectible receivables are paid back to the customers annually on a pro rata basis 
rrc fees of million and million are included in accrued expenses as of december  and december   respectively 
all other receivables related to services not covered by the rrc fees are evaluated and  if deemed not collectible  are appropriately reserved 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
when appropriate  we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
the calculation of deferred tax assets including valuation allowances and liabilities requires us to apply significant judgment related to such factors as the application of complex tax laws  changes in tax laws and our future operations 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required based upon these factors 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance  potentially resulting in additional expense or benefit in the period of change 
income tax provision includes us federal  state and local income taxes and is based on pre tax income or loss 
the provision or benefit for income taxes is based upon our estimate of our annual effective income tax rate 
in determining the estimated annual effective income tax rate  we analyze various factors  including projections of our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated  the impact of state and local income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
this statement is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 or apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb no 
 and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  including the fair value recognition provisions  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal includes a compensation cost for all stock based awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all stock based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective transition method  prior periods are not restated 
for stock based awards subject to graded vesting  we have utilized the straight line method for allocating compensation cost by period 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r for was million 
at december   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested stock options  non vested restricted stock and non vested phantom stock units granted prior to that date was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in accordance with fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  we elected to adopt the alternative method provided in this fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
the alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  which is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  we presented all benefits of tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock based compensation as an operating cash flow in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
beginning on january   we changed our cash flow presentation in accordance with sfas no 
r  which requires benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized excess tax benefits to be classified as a financing cash inflow with a corresponding operating cash outflow 
for the year ended december   we included million of excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow with a corresponding operating cash outflow 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on january   our income before income taxes and net income for the year ended december  were approximately million and million less  respectively  than if we had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb no 
basic and diluted net income per common share for the year ended december  were each approximately less than if we had not adopted sfas no 
r 
both prior and subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we estimated the value of stock based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the value of each stock based award was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under sfas no 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate and the expected term of the awards 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate stock based compensation under sfas no 
r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our stock based awards have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes option pricing model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based awards in the future 
certain stock based awards  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
although the fair value of our stock based awards is determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction

current trends affecting our results of operations we have experienced increased demand for our services and solutions  which has been driven by market trends such as the implementation of new technologies  expansion of new applications and end user services  industry consolidation  increased demand for secure and scalable dns systems  and increased use of us common short codes 
at the same time  our growth will require continued investment by us to keep pace with the evolving needs of the communications industry  and to ensure that we are able to deliver the quality of services that our customers demand 
we expect continued growth in wireless subscribers and competition among mobile network operators  as well as continued development of new wireless applications 
as csps expand and upgrade their networks and technology to enable the delivery of high speed wireless services  we anticipate that they will increasingly rely on our services  and wireless related transactions will remain a major contributor to our transaction volume growth 
further  we believe that mobile network operators will continue to launch and support mobile im  which will result in increased demand for our solutions 
advancements in the communications industry  such as changes from time division multiplexing  or tdm  to global system for mobile  or gsm  and the proliferation of voip service providers and the pervasive industry change to ip based networks  have driven increased addressing and infrastructure transactions in our clearinghouse 
we expect that voip service providers will continue to require access to inventories of telephone number resources  which will drive demand for our addressing services 
further  as the industry migrates towards next generation technologies and applications  we anticipate that demand for our infrastructure services will increase 
as the communications industry has changed to meet consumer demands and new technological advancements  consolidation among industry participants has increased 
consolidation requires the integration of disparate systems and networks  which has driven increased demand for our addressing  interoperability and infrastructure services 
we anticipate that future consolidations will continue to drive growth in our transaction volumes 
since becoming a public company in  we have experienced  and will continue to experience  increases in certain general and administrative expenses to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to public companies 
these laws and regulations include the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules of the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange 
for example  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  increases in such items as personnel costs  professional services fees  fees for independent directors and the cost of directors and officers liability insurance 
we believe that these costs will approximate to million annually 
in addition  as our scope of services and solutions expands  we must continue to invest in hiring and retaining necessary personnel and building internal infrastructure to manage our anticipated growth  particularly with respect to businesses that we have acquired and will acquire in the future 
for example  we made  and anticipate making  substantial investments in additions to our sales force  increased facilities and personnel in international markets  and costs related to the marketing of our expanded services and solutions 
this use of resources may affect our operating margins

total revenue increased million due to increases in addressing  interoperability and infrastructure transactions 
addressing 
addressing revenue increased million due primarily to the expanded range of dns services offered by neustar as a result of the acquisition of ultradns in april  and the continued increase in the number of subscribers for us common short codes 
this increase in addressing revenue was also driven by the continued implementation and expansion of carrier networks to facilitate new communications services  such as internet telephony

infrastructure and other 
infrastructure and other revenue increased million due to an increase in the demand for our network management services 
of this amount  million was attributable to customers making changes to their networks that required actions such as disconnects and modifications to network elements

as a result of this earnings trend  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets and reversed approximately million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the reversal resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit of million  and a reduction of goodwill of million 
the benefit was offset by current income tax expense of million and deferred income taxes of million  resulting in a net income tax expense of million for our annual effective income tax rate increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal source of liquidity has been cash provided by operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the benefits of tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized for the exercise of common stock options excess tax benefits are classified as a financing cash inflow and a corresponding operating cash outflow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
as a result  currently our principal sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and cash inflows relating to excess tax benefits 
our principal uses of cash have been to fund acquisitions  facility expansions  capital expenditures  working capital  dividend payouts on preferred stock  and debt service requirements 
we anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be acquisitions  working capital  facility expansion and capital expenditures 
total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   a decrease from million at december  this decrease was due primarily to cash expenditures of approximately million to fund the acquisitions of ultradns and followap 
this decrease was offset by cash provided by operating activities and cash inflows relating to excess tax benefits 
as of december   we had million available under the revolving loan commitment of our bank credit facility  subject to the terms and conditions of that facility 
on february   we entered into a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  swing line lender and l c issuer  jp morgan securities  inc  as lead arranger and as book manager  credit suisse securities usa llc  as syndication agent  deutsche bank trust company americas and sun trust bank  as documentation agents and the lenders under the credit agreement 
as of february   we had million available under the revolving loan commitment of this credit agreement 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
discussion of cash flows cash flows from operations net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally the result of net changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  including an increase of million in cash flows due to income tax receivables  and an million increase in net income  which was partially offset by a decrease of non cash adjustments of million  including a cash outflow increase of million relating to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation for the year ended december   which is the required presentation under sfas no 
r 
in the corresponding period in  we did not record excess tax benefits from stock based compensation as a cash outflow from operating activities 
cash flows from investing net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to an increase of million of cash paid for acquisitions  which was partially offset by an increase of the sales of short term investments totaling million 
cash flows from financing net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was principally the result of million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation being recorded as an inflow to cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december   as well as an increase of million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
in prior periods  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation were recorded as cash flows provided by operating activities  which was the presentation required prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r 
in addition  the overall increase in net cash provided by financing activities resulted from a decrease in of million for the payment of preferred stock dividends in for which there was no corresponding payment in and a million decrease in repayments of notes payable and capital leases 
these reductions in cash used in financing activities from as compared to were offset by a decrease of million for cash collateralized letters of credit relating to our december contract amendments with the north american portability management llc 
contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space  computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations long term debt total debt and credit facilities on february   we entered into a new credit agreement  which provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million 
borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either a eurodollar rate plus a spread ranging from to  or at a base rate plus a spread ranging from to  with such spread in each case depending on the ratio of our consolidated senior funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda 
this new credit agreement expires on february  there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at february  borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate purposes and to finance acquisitions as permitted by the terms of this credit agreement 
the new credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  and events of default 
the new credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest charge ratio and a maximum consolidated senior funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the new credit agreement 
lenders holding more than of the loans and commitments under the new credit agreement may elect to accelerate the maturity of amounts due thereunder upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default 
in addition  the new credit agreement contains terms that enable us to ensure compliance with neutrality obligations to which it is subject  including neutrality based restrictions on assignment and provisions that allow us to replace or remove a lender or agent to preserve our ability to comply with our neutrality obligations 
until february   we had a revolving credit facility  which provided us with up to million in available credit 
the commitments under this credit agreement were terminated simultaneous with the closing of the new credit agreement on february  this credit agreement provided for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to million and was secured by substantially all of our assets  subject to certain previously disclosed limitations 
upon the execution of the new credit agreement on february   letters of credit with a face amount of million  issued under this credit agreement remained outstanding after the termination thereof and are supported by cash collateral pledged by us 
borrowings under our former revolving credit facility could be either base rate loans or eurodollar rate loans 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at december  and december   however  total available borrowings were reduced by outstanding letters of credit of million and million at december  and december   respectively  which reduced the amount we could borrow under the revolving credit facility 
base rate loans bore interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the lender s prime rate 
eurodollar rate loans bore interest at the eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin 
under the terms of our previous revolving credit facility  we were required to comply with certain financial covenants  such as maintaining minimum levels of consolidated net worth  quarterly consolidated ebitda and liquid assets and not exceeding certain levels of capital expenditures and leverage ratios 
additionally  there were negative covenants that limited our ability to declare or pay dividends  acquire additional indebtedness  incur liens  dispose of significant assets  make acquisitions or significantly change the nature of our business without the permission of the lender 
during  and  we were not in compliance with certain covenants and obtained waivers for such defaults 
effect of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment 
we do not believe that inflation had any material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   and recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax provisions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods  disclosure and transition  and explicitly excludes income taxes from the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently assessing the effect of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our exchange rate risk related to foreign currency exchange for was principally due to our number portability contract with canadian lnp consortium  inc based on this agreement  we recognize revenue on a per transaction basis as the services are performed and bill for these services using the canadian dollar at a fixed exchange rate that is updated annually 
as a result  we are affected by currency fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the canadian dollar 
the net impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on earnings was not material for the years ended december   or  respectively 
interest rate exposure is primarily limited to the approximately million of short term investments owned by us at december  such investments consist principally of commercial paper  high grade auction rate securities and us government or corporate debt securities 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
for the year ended december   a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates would have reduced our interest income for the year ended december  by approximately  in addition  we do not consider the present rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business
