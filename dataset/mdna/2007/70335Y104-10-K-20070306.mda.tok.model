these proposed investments are subject to the completion of our due diligence and approval process as well as negotiation of definitive agreements with prospective portfolio companies and  as a result  may not result in completed transactions

yields are computed using actual interest income earned for the respective year  including amortization of loan fees and original issue discount  divided by the weighted average fair value of debt investments 
the yield during the year ended december  was positively impacted by the recognition of deferred financing fees received from one of our portfolio companies as a result of the repayment of its entire outstanding debt 
for the year ended december   the weighted average yield on all of our outstanding debt investments was approximately  excluding the impact of the unamortized deferred financing fees 
the remaining balance of deferred financing fees for this portfolio company recognized during the year ended december  totaled  the lower weighted average yield on our outstanding debt  excluding the impact of the unamortized financing fees  in as compared to related to the shift in our investment mix towards senior secured loans

as of december   million of our portfolio investments at fair value excluding unearned income were at fixed interest rates  which represented approximately of our total portfolio of investments at fair value excluding unearned income 
we generally structure our subordinated debt investments at fixed rates  although many of our senior secured and junior secured loans are  and will be  at variable rates

our swap agreement entered into in march is at a fixed rate of on an initial notional amount of million  for five years  and our december swap agreement is at a fixed rate of on an initial notional amount of million  for five years 
the swaps were put into place to hedge against changes in variable interest payments on a portion of our outstanding borrowings 
for the year ended december   net unrealized gains attributed to the swaps were approximately  while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower rates with respect to the hedged portfolio 
at december   we did not hold any derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes 
the composition of our investment portfolio by industry sector  excluding unearned income  as of december  and december  at cost and fair value was as follows december  december  cost fair value cost fair value manufacturing distribution service consumer retail goods publishing defense total represents percentage of total portfolio

at december   our equity investments consisted of common and preferred stock  llc membership interests and warrants to acquire equity interests in certain of our portfolio companies 
at december   all of our equity investments were warrants to acquire equity interests in certain of our portfolio companies 
warrants to acquire equity interests allow us to participate in the potential appreciation in the value of the portfolio company  while minimizing the amount of upfront cost to us 
asset quality debt portfolio we utilize a standard investment rating system for our entire portfolio of debt investments 
investment rating is used for investments that exceed expectations and or capital gain is expected 
investment rating is used for investments that are generally performing in accordance with expectations 
investment rating is used for performing investments that require closer monitoring 
investment rating is used for investments performing below expectations where a higher risk of loss exists 
investment rating is used for investments performing significantly below expectations where we expect a loss

at december   all cash interest and principal due on this investment was paid on a timely basis 
on may   we sold this investment 
results of operations the principal measure of our financial performance is the net income loss which includes net investment income loss and net realized and unrealized gain loss 
net investment income loss is the difference between our income from interest  dividends  fees  and other investment income and our operating expenses 
net realized gain loss on investments  is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their stated cost 
net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
comparison of the year ended december  and december  total investment income total investment income included interest and dividend income on our investments  fee income and other investment income 
fee income consists principally of loan and arrangement fees  annual administrative fees and unused fees 
other investment income consists primarily of the recognition of deferred financing fees received from our portfolio companies on the repayment of its entire outstanding debt 
total investment income for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   this amount consisted of interest income of  from cash and cash equivalents  million of interest income from portfolio investments which included million in payment in kind or pik interest and dividends   in fee income and  in other investment income 
for the year ended december   this amount primarily consisted of interest income of  from cash and cash equivalents  million of interest income from portfolio investments which included million in payment in kind or pik interest   in fee income and  in other investment income 
the increase in our total investment income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase in the weighted average fair value balance outstanding of our interest bearing investment portfolio during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the weighted average fair value balance outstanding of our interest bearing investment portfolio was approximately million as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  expenses expenses included compensation expense  consulting fees  interest on our outstanding indebtedness  professional fees  a prepayment penalty associated with the repayment of the outstanding balance under our million financing agreement  and general and administrative expenses 
expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
expenses decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of incurring a million prepayment penalty in from the repayment of the outstanding balance under our million financing agreement and the termination of consulting agreements on july  those decreases were offset by higher compensation expense in the amount of million   of which related to non cash stock option compensation as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  on january   higher interest expense in the amount of  increased professional fees in the amount of  and higher general and administrative expenses in the amount of million 
the higher compensation expense was attributable to the increase in the number of personnel due to increased investment activities and increased bonus accruals primarily due to our entry into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers during the latter part of the year ended december  we expect to hire additional employees as needed in the future as our investment activities grow 
the higher interest expense is attributable to an increase in the borrowings outstanding under our million amended and restated securitization revolving credit facility 
our weighted average borrowings outstanding during the three months ended december  were approximately million 
such borrowings are primarily used to fund investments 
the increased professional fees are a result of higher costs attributable to being a public company 
the increase in general and administrative costs is primarily due to increases in the following insurance  directors fees  investor relations and franchise taxes 
we incurred consulting fees in the amount of  for the year ended december   payable to two entities affiliated with compass group investments  inc these consulting arrangements were terminated on july  see related party transactions 
realized gain loss on sale of investments net realized gain loss on sale of investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their stated cost 
during the year ended december   we sold our investment in interstate highway sign corporation and realized a net loss of million 
in connection with the sale of the interstate highway sign corporation investment  the company also received a participation interest of in any future consideration received by the purchaser with respect to the subordinated debt investment 
the company  at this time  does not believe it will receive any additional consideration from the interstate highway sign corporation investment  and accordingly  has not recorded any value with respect to the participation interest 
in addition  also during  we realized a capital gain of  on the sale of our investment in intergraph corporation 
we did not realize any gains or losses on the sale of our portfolio investments during the year ended december  net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments we determine the value of each investment in our portfolio on a quarterly basis  and changes in value result in unrealized appreciation or depreciation being recognized in our statement of operations 
value  as defined in section a of the act  is i the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and ii for all other securities and assets  fair value is as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
since there is typically no readily available market value for the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
at december  and  portfolio investments recorded at fair value net of unearned income were approximately and of our total assets  respectively 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market  the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by the board of directors may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make 
we specifically value each individual investment on a quarterly basis 
we will record unrealized depreciation on investments when we believe that an investment has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful  or when the enterprise value of the portfolio company does not currently support the cost of our debt or equity investment 
enterprise value means the entire value of the company to a potential buyer  including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the company at a point in time 
we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and or our equity security has also appreciated in value 
changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
our process for determining the fair value of our investments begins with determining the enterprise value of the portfolio company 
there is no one methodology to determine enterprise value and  in fact  for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is best expressed as a range of values  from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value 
to determine the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze its historical and projected financial results 
we generally require portfolio companies to provide annual audited and quarterly and monthly unaudited financial statements  as well as annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year 
typically in the private equity business  companies are valued based on multiples of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  cash flow  net income  revenues or  in limited instances  book value 
when using ebitda to determine enterprise value  we may adjust ebitda for non recurring items 
such adjustments are intended to normalize ebitda to reflect the portfolio company s earnings power 
adjustments to ebitda may include compensation to previous owners  acquisition  recapitalization  or restructuring related items or one time non recurring income or expense items 
in determining a multiple to use for valuation purposes  we look to private merger and acquisition statistics  discounted public trading multiples or industry practices 
in estimating a reasonable multiple  we consider not only the fact that our portfolio company may be a private company relative to a peer group of public comparables  but we also consider the size and scope of our portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses 
in some cases  the best valuation methodology may be a discounted cash flow analysis based on future projections 
if a portfolio company is distressed  a liquidation analysis may provide the best indication of enterprise value 
if there is adequate enterprise value to support the repayment of our debt securities  the fair value of these securities normally corresponds to cost plus the amortized original issue discount unless the borrower s condition or other factors lead to a determination of fair value at a different amount 
the conditions and other factors we consider in determining the fair value of our debt securities include  among other factors  the financial risk and performance of the portfolio company  competitive market dynamics and  to a lesser extent  market interest rates 
the fair value of equity interests in portfolio companies is determined based on various factors  including the enterprise value remaining for equity holders after the repayment of the portfolio company s debt and other preference capital  and other pertinent factors such as recent offers to purchase a portfolio company  recent transactions involving the purchase or sale of the portfolio company s equity securities  or other liquidation events 
the determined fair values of equity securities are generally discounted to account for restrictions on resale and minority ownership positions 
we received valuation assistance from our independent valuation firm  duff phelps  llc  on a portion of our investment portfolio at december  and on our entire investment portfolio at december  net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio

the increase in our total investment income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase in the weighted average fair value balance outstanding of  and higher yields on  our interest bearing investment portfolio during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the weighted average fair value balance outstanding of our interest bearing investment portfolio was approximately million as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  expenses expenses included salaries and benefits  consulting fees  professional fees  interest payments  a prepayment penalty associated with the repayment of the outstanding balance under our million financing agreement and general and administrative expenses 
expenses for the years ended december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
expenses increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of incurring a million prepayment penalty from the payoff of the outstanding balance under our million credit agreement  higher interest expense  which increased by million  higher employee compensation  which increased by million  higher professional fees  which increased by  and higher general and administrative expenses  which increased by  million  offset by a decrease in consulting fees of  the higher interest expense was attributable to an increase in borrowings outstanding under the million financing agreement through august   the date we paid off the outstanding balance under the financing agreement 
such borrowings were used to fund investments 
the higher employee compensation was attributable to the increase in the number of our personnel due to increased investment activities and increased bonus accruals primarily due to our entry into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers during the year ended december  we expect to hire additional employees as needed in the future as our investment activities grow 
the increased professional fees are a result of higher costs attributable with being a public company 
the increase in general and administrative costs is primarily due to increases in insurance costs  directors fees  and investor relations

formerly known as harris nesbitt corp a portion of these funds  approximately million  were released to us on january  for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the comparable period 
this change was due primarily to an increase in net income  due to an increase in realized loss on the sale of investments  and an increase in stock based compensation expense offset by an increase in interest receivable  an increase in unrealized appreciation on investments and an increase in payment in kind interest and dividends 
cash used for investing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
this change was principally due to a net increase of million in our borrowings  a decrease in restricted cash of million and a decrease in deferred financing costs of million  offset by a decrease in net proceeds from sale of common stock of million and an increase in dividends paid of million 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering  our primary sources of capital had been from compass group investments  inc which provided us with a million equity investment  a  demand note and a million secured revolving line of credit and an unaffiliated lender which provided us with a line of credit under which we had the ability to borrow up to million  subject to certain conditions 
on august   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock and on august   the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock 
we received net proceeds after underwriters commissions  discounts and fees of million 
concurrent with our initial public offering  we entered into a securitization revolving credit facility  which we amended and restated in september see borrowings 
on june   we closed a secondary public offering of  shares of common stock and received gross proceeds of million less underwriters commissions and discounts  and fees of million 
also  as part of this secondary public offering  compass group investments  inc sold  shares of our common stock  which resulted in it beneficially owning of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately upon the completion of such offering

we expect our cash on hand  borrowings under our future debt agreements  including our amended and restated securitization revolving credit facility  and cash generated from operations  including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies and  to a lesser extent  the temporary investments of cash in us government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less  will be adequate to meet our cash needs at our current level of operations 
our primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies 
in order to fund new originations  we intend to use cash on hand  advances under our amended and restated securitization revolving credit facility and equity financings 
our amended and restated securitization revolving credit facility contains collateral requirements  including  but not limited to  minimum diversity  rating and yield  and limitations on loan size 
these limitations may limit our ability to fund certain new originations with advances under the facility  in which case we will seek to fund originations using new debt or equity financings 
in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to ric s under subchapter m of the code  we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income  which includes our taxable interest and fee income  except for certain realized net capital gains 
taxable income generally differs from net income loss for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses  and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation  as unrealized appreciation or depreciation on our investments is not included in taxable income until realized 
taxable income includes non cash income  such as pik interest and dividends or the amortization of discounts and fees 
cash collections of income resulting from pik interest and dividends or the amortization of discounts and fees generally occur upon the repayment of the loans or debt securities that include such items 
non cash taxable income is reduced by non cash expenses  such as realized losses and depreciation and amortization expense

formerly known as harris nesbitt corp the facility allows our special purpose subsidiary to borrow up to million through the issuance of notes to a multi seller commercial paper conduit that is administered by the affiliated entity 
the facility is secured by all of the loans held by our special purpose subsidiary 
the facility bears interest at the commercial paper rate plus and allows our special purpose subsidiary to make draws under the facility until july   unless extended prior to such date for an additional day period with the consent of the lender 
if the facility is not extended  any principal amounts then outstanding will be amortized over a month period following july  and interest will accrue on outstanding borrowings under the facility at the prime rate plus

regulated investment company status and dividends effective as of august   we elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
as long as we qualify as a ric  we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains  to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed  or deemed to be distributed  to stockholders on a timely basis 
taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses  and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation  until realized 
dividends declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income  the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year 
distributions also may include returns of capital 
to maintain ric tax treatment  we must  among other things  distribute  with respect to each taxable year  at least of our investment company taxable income ie  our net ordinary income and our realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any 
in order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on rics  we currently intend to distribute  with respect to each calendar year  an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year and any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years

we currently intend to retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital gains ie  realized net long term capital gains in excess of realized net short term capital losses and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders 
if we do this  our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after tax proceeds in our common stock 
our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits or  in certain circumstances  tax refunds equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them 
during  we realized a capital gain of approximately  and a capital loss of million 
we did not realize any capital gains during at december   our net realized capital loss of million will be available to offset capital gains until july  to the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal tax year fall below the total amount of our dividends for that fiscal year  a portion of those dividend distributions may be deemed a tax return of capital to our stockholders 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the act and due to provisions in our credit facilities 
if we do not distribute at least a certain percentage of our taxable income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our status as a ric 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
changes in our estimates and assumptions could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
valuation of portfolio investments the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
our process for determining the fair value of our investments begins with determining the enterprise value of the portfolio company 
there is no one methodology to determine enterprise value and  in fact  for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is best expressed as a range of fair values  from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value 
to determine the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze its historical and projected financial results 
we generally require portfolio companies to provide annual audited and quarterly and monthly unaudited financial statements  as well as annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year 
typically in the private equity business  companies are valued based on multiples of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  cash flow  net income  revenues or  in limited instances  book value 
when using ebitda to determine enterprise value  we may adjust ebitda for non recurring items 
such adjustments are intended to normalize ebitda to reflect the portfolio company s earnings power 
adjustments to ebitda may include compensation to previous owners  acquisition  recapitalization  or restructuring related items or one time non recurring income or expense items 
in determining a multiple to use for valuation purposes  we look to private merger and acquisition statistics  discounted public trading multiples or industry practices 
in estimating a reasonable multiple  we consider not only the fact that our portfolio company may be a private company relative to a peer group of public comparables  but we also consider the size and scope of our portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses 
in some cases  the best valuation methodology may be a discounted cash flow analysis based on future projections 
if a portfolio company is distressed  a liquidation analysis may provide the best indication of enterprise value 
if there is adequate enterprise value to support the repayment of our debt securities  the fair value of these securities normally corresponds to cost plus amortized original issue discount unless the borrower s condition or other factors lead to a determination of fair value at a different amount 
the fair value of equity interests in portfolio companies is determined based on various factors  including the enterprise value remaining for equity holders after the repayment of the portfolio company s debt and other preference capital  and other pertinent factors such as recent offers to purchase a portfolio company  recent transactions involving the purchase or sale of the portfolio company s equity securities  or other liquidation events 
the determined fair values of equity securities are generally discounted to account for restrictions on resale and minority ownership positions 
the fair value of our investments at december  and was determined in good faith by our board of directors 
we received valuation assistance from our independent valuation firm  duff phelps  llc  on a portion of our investment portfolio at december  and on our entire investment portfolio at december  fee income recognition we receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of our business  including arrangement fees and loan fees 
we account for our fee income in accordance with emerging issues task force issue accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses certain aspects of a company s accounting for arrangements containing multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables ie  there are separate units of accounting 
eitf states that the total consideration received for the arrangement be allocated to each unit based upon each unit s relative fair value 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
in determining fair value of various fee income we receive  we will first rely on data compiled through our investment and syndication activities and secondly on independent third party data 
the timing of revenue recognition for a given unit of accounting will depend on the nature of the deliverable s in that accounting unit and the corresponding revenue recognition model and whether the general conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
fee income for which fair value cannot be reasonably ascertained is recognized using the interest method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  sfas no 

we have historically recognized fee income in accordance with sfas no 
in addition  we capitalize and offset direct loan origination costs against the origination fees received and only defer the net fee 
payment in kind or pik interest and dividends we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contractual payment in kind or pik interest or dividends  which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term or contractually deferred dividends added to our equity investment in the portfolio company 
we will cease accruing pik interest if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due  and we will cease accruing pik dividends if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to make pik dividend payments in the future 
in certain cases  a portfolio company makes principal payments on its loan prior to making payments to reduce the pik loan balances and  therefore  the pik portion of a portfolio company s loan can increase while the total outstanding amount of the loan to that portfolio company may stay the same or decrease 
accrued pik interest and dividends represented million or of our portfolio of investments at fair value excluding unearned income as of december  and million or of our portfolio of investments at fair value excluding unearned income as of december  the net increase in loan and equity balances as a result of contracted pik arrangements are separately identified on our statements of cash flows 
pik related activity for the year ended december  was as follows fiscal year ended december  beginning pik balance pik interest and dividends earned during the period sale of investments pik payments received during the period ending pik balance interest and dividend income recognition interest income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
when a loan or debt security becomes days or more past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service its debt or other obligations  we will generally place the loan or debt security on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
at december   none of our loans or debt securities were greater than days past due or on non accrual status 
at december   although none of our loans and debt securities were greater than days past due  loans and debt securities at fair value totaling million were not accruing pik interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our business activities contain elements of market risk 
we consider interest rates to be our principal market risk 
we consider the management of risk essential to conducting our business 
accordingly  our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
our investment income is affected by changes in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates 
approximately of our investment portfolio at fair value bears interest at fixed rates  with the remainder at floating rates 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
in periods of rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net investment income 
our interest rates on our borrowings are based on commercial paper rates 
we have and may continue to use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
we have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have affected investment income by approximately million and interest expense by approximately  although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in assets resulting from operations  or net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate
