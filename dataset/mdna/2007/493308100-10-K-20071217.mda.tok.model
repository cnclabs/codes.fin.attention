overview we offer technology based services and systems that enable enterprises to improve their mobile and online business performance and communications technologies 
we offer internet test and measurement services itm  customer experience test and measurement solutions cem  and mobile test and measurement services mtm 
our itm category includes all of our geographically distributed web site and application monitoring and measurement services  voice over ip and streaming measurement services  load testing services and professional services engagements 
the cem category consists of the webeffective platform whether sold as a technology license or on a subscription basis  or as part of a competitive intelligence study or custom consulting engagement and the financial services scorecard services sold on a subscription basis or as part of a custom consulting engagement 
the mtm category consists of our on demand mobile monitoring and testing services  our global roamer services and our sigos site systems 
we believe all of these categories of services help our customers reduce costs  improve customer satisfaction and increase profitability 
we offer our itm services primarily on a subscription basis and our cem services primarily on an engagement basis although  in some cases  we offer itm professional services on an incident and per engagement basis 
we also offer the self service use of our cem technology for a fixed period of time on a subscription basis 
subscription fees range from monthly to annual commitments  and vary based on the type of service selected  the number of pages  transactions or devices monitored  the number of measurement locations and or appliances  the frequency of the measurements and any additional features ordered 
engagements typically involve fixed price contracts based on the complexity of the project  the size of a cem panel  and the type of testing to be conducted 
our mtm solutions are offered on a subscription basis or license basis 
the subscriptions typically are for a fixed period over twelve months  and are based on the number of locations and devices from which monitoring and testing is performed  and the number of mobile operators and services covered by such monitoring and testing 
the sigos site system is usually offered via a software license fee model  but because it is bundled with ongoing maintenance and support for a fixed contract period  the license fees are amortized over the length of the contract and are therefore included in ratable license revenue 
the sigos global roamer service is offered via a subscription fee model typically on a three to twelve month basis and included in subscription services revenue 
our net loss decreased by approximately million  from net loss of approximately million for the year ended september  to a net loss of approximately million for the year ended september  total net revenue increased by approximately million or  from approximately million for the year ended september  to approximately million for the year ended september  the increase in total net revenue was primarily attributable to an increased contribution from our ratable licenses revenue of approximately million which represents sales of our sigos site systems 
total expenses increased by approximately million or  from approximately million for the year ended september  to approximately million for the year ended september  the increase in total expenses was mainly attributable to including costs of keynote sigos for a full year in fiscal as 
table of contents compared to fiscal as well as incremental investments we made in our sales and marketing departments in fiscal in addition to having a full year of keynote sigos related expenses in fiscal  the increase was also due to an increase in costs of ratable licenses associated with higher ratable licenses revenue generated from existing customers renewing existing maintenance contracts as well as new and existing customers purchasing additional site systems which revenue is being recorded as ratable licenses revenue 
we anticipate that total expenses for the first quarter of fiscal will increase as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily due to our increased investments in sales and marketing personnel and personnel related costs 
for the year ended september   our largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenue 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or in aggregate  will renew our services and continue to generate revenue in any future period 
in addition  our customers that have monthly renewal arrangements may terminate their services at any time with little or no penalty 
if we lose a major customer or a group of significant customers  our revenue could significantly decline 
we believe that the challenges for our business include continuing to drive growth in our itm  mtm and cem revenue  growing multiple page broadband related revenue while converting customers from using our single page single device measurements like web site perspective to multi page measurements such as transaction perspective and application perspective  continued progress in growing our cem business and continuing to control our expenses for fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that have a significant effect on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance inventories and inventory valuation allocation of purchase price for business combinations goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  and long lived assets stock based compensation income taxes  deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition sop  and the emerging issues task force issue  applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software 
table of contents deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software eitf 
we generally recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product or service  fee is fixed and determinable and collection is deemed reasonably assured 
one of the critical judgments that we make is the assessment that collectibility is probable 
our recognition of revenue is based on our assessment of the probability of collecting the related accounts receivable on a customer by customer basis 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  then revenue is deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash from that arrangement 
our revenue consists of subscription services revenue  ratable licenses revenue and professional services revenue 
subscription services revenue subscription services revenue consists of fees from sales of our perspective services and global roamer subscriptions 
revenue for these particular services are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition sab and emerging issues task fore eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we enter into multiple element arrangements where sufficient objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the allocation of revenue 
in addition  the individual elements contained within the subscription arrangements do not have value to the customers on a stand alone basis given that the customers are purchasing an ongoing service activity and not discrete activities 
therefore  the subscriptions are considered to be a single unit of accounting and we recognize the entire arrangement fee as revenue either ratably over the service period  generally over twelve months  or based upon actual monthly usage 
for customers that pay in advance  subscription services revenue is deferred upon invoicing and is recognized ratably over the service period  generally ranging from one to twelve months  commencing on the day service is first provided 
for customers billed in arrears  subscription services revenue is invoiced monthly upon completion of the services 
revenue from the use of our cem technology in cem engagements is recorded as professional services revenue 
however  in the instances where customers purchase a subscription for the use of such technology only  we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period  commencing on the day service is first provided  and such revenue is recorded as subscription services revenue 
ratable license revenue ratable licenses revenue consists of sales of our mobile automated test equipment  maintenance  engineering and minor consulting services associated with keynote sigos system integrated test environment site 
we frequently enter into multiple element arrangements with mobile customers  for the sale of our automated test equipment  including both hardware and software licenses  consulting services to configure the hardware and software implementation or integration services  post contract support maintenance services  training services and other minor consulting services 
these multiple element arrangements are within the scope of sop no 
 and eitf this determination is based on the hardware component of our multiple element arrangements being deemed to be a software related element 
in addition  customers do not purchase the hardware without also purchasing the software  as well as the software and hardware being sold as a package  with payments due from the customer upon delivery of this hardware and software package 
none of the keynote sigos implementation integration services provided by us are considered to be essential to the functionality of the licensed product 
this assessment is due to the implementation integration services being performed during a relatively short period generally within two to three months compared to the length of the arrangement which typically ranges from twelve to thirty six months 
additionally  the implementation integration services are general in nature and we have a history of successfully gaining customer acceptance 
we cannot allocate the arrangement consideration to the multiple elements based on the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value since sufficient vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  typically maintenance 
therefore  we recognize the entire arrangement fee into revenue ratably over the maintenance service period  historically ranging from twelve to thirty six months  once the implementation and integration services are completed  usually within two to three months following the delivery of the hardware and 
table of contents software 
where acceptance language exists  the ratable recognition of revenue begins when evidence of customer acceptance of the software and hardware has occurred as intended under the respective arrangement s contractual terms 
professional services revenue professional services revenue consists of fees generated from our loadpro  cem and professional consulting services that are purchased as part of a professional service project 
revenue from these services are recognized as the services are performed  typically over a period of one to three months 
for professional service projects that contain milestones  we recognize revenue once the services or milestones have been delivered  based on input measures 
payment occurs either up front or over time 
we also enter into multiple element arrangements that generally consist of either the combination of subscription and professional services or multiple professional services 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
when sufficient objective evidence of fair value does not exist for undelivered items when subscription and professional services are combined  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining applicable performance period for the subscription services once the professional services have been delivered 
when sufficient objective evidence of fair value does not exist for undelivered items where only professional services are combined  the entire arrangement fee is deferred and revenue is recognized upon the delivery of all the elements of the arrangement 
deferred revenue deferred revenue is comprised of all unearned revenue that has been collected in advance  primarily unearned subscription services and ratable licenses revenue  and is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the revenue is earned 
any unpaid deferred revenue reduces the balance of accounts receivable 
short term deferred revenue represents the unearned revenue that has been collected in advance that will be earned within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
correspondingly  long term deferred revenue represents the unearned revenue that will be earned after twelve months of the balance sheet date and primarily relates to ratable licenses revenue 
the table below represents the balances of gross deferred revenue short term and long term aggregated as of september  and the addback to net deferred revenue which represents the deferred revenue balance as recorded on the consolidated balance sheets represents the unpaid deferred revenue that has an associated accounts receivable balance as of the balance sheet dates 
the addback of unpaid deferred revenue may change at any point in time as it is based upon the timing of when invoices are collected and whether there is any unpaid deferred revenue associated with such accounts receivable 
domestic international total net deferred revenue addback unpaid deferred revenue gross deferred revenue at september  net deferred revenue addback unpaid deferred revenue gross deferred revenue at september  we do not generally grant refunds 
revenue is not recognized for free trial periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical trends  experience and current market and industry conditions 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the age of each invoice of the accounts receivable aging  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review invoices greater than days past due to determine whether an allowance is appropriate based on the receivable balance 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for all other invoices  which is calculated by applying a percentage  based on historical collection trends  to the outstanding accounts receivable balance as well as specifically identified accounts that are deemed uncollectible 

table of contents billing allowance represents the reserve for potential billing adjustments that are recorded as a reduction of revenue and represents a percentage of revenue based on historical trends and experience 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance represent management s best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable and billing adjustments  including unforeseen declines in market conditions and collection rates and the number of billing adjustments  may result in additional allowances in the future or reductions in allowances due to future recoveries or trends 
inventories and inventory valuation inventories related to sigos site services were approximately million as of september   and relate to direct costs associated with finished goods hardware 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
market is based on estimated replacement value 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including average selling prices and sales volumes of future periods 
we primarily utilize current selling prices for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost 
any adjustment for market value is charged to direct cost of ratable licenses at the point of market value decline 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales of our product 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand are provided for 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions  and product life cycles 
our inventories include mainly computer hardware and mobile hardware and accessories that may be subject to technological obsolescence 
our products are sold in a competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take inventory write downs 
for the years ended september  and  we did not experience any write down of inventories 
allocation of purchase price for business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as any in process research and development ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is usually determined based on management s assessment in conjunction with valuations performed by an independent third party 
such a valuation requires making significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to  future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists and acquired developed technologies  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed and discount rates 
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
other estimates such as accruals associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill  identifiable intangibles assets  and long lived assets goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we evaluate our identifiable goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable for our single operating segment 
in addition we evaluate our intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 

table of contents management continually applies its judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted net cash flows used to assess recoverability of the intangible assets and the fair value of the asset group 
if future events or circumstances indicate that an impairment assessment is required and an asset group is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
we performed an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter in fiscal   and we did not record an impairment charge based on our reviews 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of september  was approximately million as compared to million as of september  if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on goodwill to reduce its carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
if future events or circumstances indicate that an impairment assessment is required on intangible or long lived assets and an asset group is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
stock based compensation we issue stock options to our employees and outside directors and provide our employees the right to purchase common stock under employee stock purchase plans 
since october   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service vesting period 
the value of an option is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
a change in our assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate  and thus  the total calculated costs associated with the grant of stock options or the issue of stock under employee stock purchase plans 
if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for more detail 
income taxes  deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase the valuation allowance in a period  our deferred tax expense increases 
if a valuation allowance is decreased  deferred tax expense may be reduced  goodwill may be reduced  or paid in capital may be increased  depending on the nature and source of the deferred tax assets 
this analysis is applied on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
tax planning strategies may be implemented which would affect the tax rate 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 
we perform an analysis of our effective tax rate and we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets quarterly 
the uncertainties which could affect the realization of our deferred tax assets include various factors as described in the risk factors section including the amount of deductions for tax purposes related to our stock options  potential successful challenges to the deferred tax assets by taxing authorities  and a mismatch of the period during which the type of taxable income and the deferred tax assets are realized or a mismatch in the tax jurisdiction in which taxable income is generated and the company with the deferred tax assets 
we establish liabilities or reserves when we believe that certain tax positions are not probable of being sustained if challenged  despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable 
we evaluate these tax reserves and related interest each quarter and adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 

table of contents we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have adequately provided for known material tax contingencies 
however  due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty relating to tax matters  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities

subscription services revenue consists of fees from subscriptions from our traditional perspective measurements  monitoring  testing  diagnostic  webeffective  financial services scorecard and global roamer services 

table of contents revenue from subscription services increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in subscription services revenue for the year ended september  over the corresponding period in fiscal was mainly attributable to increased sales of our multiple page broadband subscription services of approximately million and global roamer services of approximately million  offset by a decrease in our single page single device subscription services of approximately million 
revenue from subscription services increased approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to increased global roamer revenue due to the acquisition of sigos on april   and increased subscriptions for our multiple page broadband subscription services 
the increases were mainly offset by decreases in sales of single page single device subscription services 
we measured  for revenue based upon the average for the month  over   and  page measurements during the month of september  and  respectively 
subscription services fees can vary based on the number of pages measured  the number of devices monitored  the number of measurement locations  the number of users  the number of hours  the frequency of the measurements  the number of private agents  the additional features ordered  and the type of services purchased 
we believe that subscription services revenue may increase somewhat in the future as a percentage of total revenue 
however  we cannot assure you that this revenue will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
we are continuing to replace single page single device subscriptions with our multiple page broadband services and expect to reduce single page single device subscriptions revenue to less than of itm subscription revenue 
ratable licenses 
ratable licenses revenue consists of sales of mobile automated test equipment  maintenance  support  engineering and minor consulting services associated with sigos site 
revenue from ratable licenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to a full year of revenue in fiscal as compared to six months in fiscal since our acquisition of keynote sigos occurred in the second half of fiscal in addition to keynote sigos contributing revenue for twelve months  we experienced revenue growth from the sale of new sigos site systems and existing customers renewing maintenance agreements 
all sales are being recognized in revenue over the maintenance period for each contract which is typically twelve to thirty six months 
we expect revenue growth for ratable licenses will be much less than experienced in fiscal year this is primarily attributable to the amount of revenue being recognized from prior periods normalizing with new sales contracts that will be amortized over twelve to thirty six months 
revenue from ratable licenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase was due to the fact that sigos was acquired in april professional services 
revenue from professional services decreased slightly by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreased contribution of approximately million from cem engagements  offset partially by increased contribution of approximately million from our itm consulting engagements 
revenue from professional services decreased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreased professional services contribution from webeffective engagements  offset partially by increased contribution from our financial services scorecard services

direct costs of subscription services consist of connection fees to major telecommunication and internet access providers for bandwidth usage of our measurement computers  which are located around the world  depreciation  maintenance and other equipment charges for our measurement and data collection infrastructure and global roamer services 
direct costs of subscription services increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of subscription services revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with our mobile device perspective services and mobile application perspective services related to building our mtm infrastructure that will allow small and medium size mobile content developers to test their mobile content 
in addition  we increased the number of locations of our probes for our global roamer services from cities as of september  to cities as of september   of the increase was related to increased costs for bandwidth  co location and depreciation due to associated higher mtm revenue 
 of the increase was attributable to increased depreciation and equipment charges  and connection fees related to additional measurement computers as well as replacing existing measurement computers related to our mtm services 
we believe that costs of subscription services in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will slightly increase as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to our continued build out of our mtm infrastructure throughout fiscal direct costs of subscription services increased by million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of subscription services revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of depreciation  connection fees and equipment charges associated with our global roamer services as a result of the acquisition of sigos on april  and increased depreciation and equipment charges  and connection fees related to additional measurement computers as well as replacing existing measurement computers  and increased depreciation related to cost of third party software for a product that was launched during the second quarter of fiscal direct costs of ratable licenses

direct costs of ratable licenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of ratable licenses revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily related to the inclusion of costs for twelve months in fiscal as compared to six months in fiscal since keynote sigos was acquired in april the increase was also attributable to test equipment sold as part of each new customer contract 
the cost of this equipment is being expensed ratably over the same twelve to thirty six months period as the revenue to which it is associated 
the decrease in direct costs of ratable licenses as a percentage of the ratable license revenue is due to containing costs for personnel and consulting associated with customer support and new customer deployment relatively constant in fiscal year we believe that direct costs of ratable licenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will slightly increase as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to an increase in cost of materials and supplies associated with increased ratable licenses revenue 

table of contents direct costs of ratable licenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  this increase was due to the fact that keynote sigos was acquired in april direct costs of professional services 
direct costs of professional services consist of compensation expenses and related costs for professional services personnel  external consulting expenses to deliver our professional services revenue  panel and reward costs associated with our webeffective intelligence platform and financial services scorecard services  all load testing bandwidth costs and related network infrastructure costs 
direct costs of professional services decreased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of professional service revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in direct costs of professional services was primarily due to lower personnel related costs associated with our cem services due to stringent cost containment as well as lower panel and reward costs due to lower demand in cem engagements 
the decrease was offset slightly by an increase of  related to our itm engagements which experienced increased external consulting expenses related to increased custom projects 
we expect that direct costs of professional services in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will remain comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal direct costs of professional services decreased by approximately  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of professional service revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in direct costs of professional services was primarily due to a decrease in cem webeffective engagements resulting in a decrease in personnel and external consulting expenses 
this decrease was offset partially by an increase in stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r on october   and an increase in facility rent related to our financial services scorecard services as a result of our acquisition of the gomezpro business of watchfire on november  development change change in thousands development development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for development personnel 
development expenses increased by million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to twelve months of costs associated with keynote sigos in fiscal as compared to six months in fiscal we anticipate that development expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase slightly compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to increased personnel headcount and higher consulting expenses 
development expenses increased by million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel and related costs as a result of our acquisition of keynote sigos in the second half of fiscal  an increase in stock based compensation due to the adoption of sfas r on october   and an increase in consulting expenses  offset partially by a decrease in personnel costs related to non sigos research and development

our sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  approximately million of the increase was attributable to twelve months of keynote sigos costs being included in fiscal as compared to six months in fiscal the remaining increase was primarily related to increased headcount of sales personnel and related costs as a result of our continued investment in our sales organization 
we believe that continued investments in our sales and marketing efforts are essential for us to maintain our market position and to further increase acceptance of our services 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to additional headcount and personnel related costs 
our sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel costs as a result of our acquisitions of keynote sigos  in the second half of fiscal  and an increase in stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r on october  further increase was attributable to increased personnel  restructuring  recruiting and travel related costs associated with additional sales personnel and increased spending on modifications to our web site 
general and administrative change change in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  accounting  legal and administrative expenses  insurance  professional services fees and other general corporate expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased slightly by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  our general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million due to twelve months of keynote sigos expenses in fiscal as compared to six months of expenses in fiscal and to a lesser extent  higher personnel costs related to additional headcount 
the increase was offset by a decrease of approximately million in expenses related to a reduction in audit related and compliance fees 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will remain comparable with the fourth quarter of fiscal our general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in our general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased personnel and personnel related costs due to the acquisition of keynote sigos in the second half of fiscal  and an increase in stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r on october  additionally  the increase in expenses resulted from increased audit and accounting fees due to the acquisition and to compliance requirements and due to an increase in non sigos personnel 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in legal expenses associated with a litigation 
table of contents settlement in fiscal related to our netraker acquisition  and a decrease in expense as a result of the settlement of a preferential claim for approximately  in fiscal there was no similar legal expense or preferential claim recorded for the year ended september  excess occupancy income costs change change in thousands rental income rental and other expenses excess occupancy income costs excess occupancy income costs are expenses associated with the portion of our headquarters building that we do not occupy  such as property taxes  insurance  building depreciation  leasing broker fees  and tenant improvement amortization 
these particular expenses are reduced by the rental income from the leasing of this space in our headquarters building 
the costs are based on the actual square footage available for lease to third parties  which was approximately for all the years ended september   and the increase in excess occupancy income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in tenant income of approximately  due to the leasing of additional space  offset by a net increase in expenses of  in october  we signed long term agreements with tenants for the remaining unoccupied portion of our headquarters building which brings occupancy to when we include the portion occupied by us 
therefore  we expect the excess occupancy income will be approximately  for the first quarter of fiscal the decrease in expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in tenant income of approximately  due to the leasing of additional space  and due to property tax refunds and the reversal of accruals related to the resolution of our property tax returns for the years ended through  amounting to amortization of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development change change in thousands amortization of identifiable intangible assets software n a amortization of identifiable intangible assets other in process research and development costs n a total amortization of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development total amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased by approximately  for the year ended september  as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal primarily due to twelve months of amortization related to our keynote sigos acquisition in fiscal as compared to six months of amortization in fiscal the increase in amortization was slightly offset by certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in the second half of fiscal amortization of intangible assets software relates to our keynote sigos developed technology related to our sigos site system and is reflected in costs of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets decreased by approximately  for the year ended september  as compared to fiscal primarily due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal  partially offset by increased amortization of identifiable intangible assets resulting from our keynote sigos and the gomez pro business acquisitions 
for the year ended september   we expensed  of in process research and development related to the estimated fair value of an acquired in process research and development project in connection with the acquisition of keynote sigos 
this project is related to certain components of sigos site technology  which had 
table of contents not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the estimated fair value of this project was determined based on the income approach method as of the acquisition date which represents the present worth of the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the developed asset 
this approach includes estimating the expected after tax cash flows attributable to the asset over its life and converting these after tax cash flows to present value through discounting 
the discounting process uses a rate of return that accounts for both the time value of money and investment risk factors 
the present value of the after tax cash flows over the life of the asset is totaled to arrive at an indication of the fair value of the asset 
this amount was immediately expensed as of the acquisition date 
we review our identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
at september   we had a remaining balance of approximately million of identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized over a three to six and one half year expected life 
we expect the amortization of identifiable intangible assets to be approximately  for the first quarter of fiscal  assuming no additional acquisitions or impairment charges 
we expect the remaining carrying value of the identifiable intangible assets as of september   as listed in the table below  will be fully amortized by september in thousands technology technology customer based software based other based trademark covenant backlog total net carrying value at september  interest income  and interest and other expenses change change in thousands interest income interest and other expenses interest income  interest and other expenses  net interest income  and interest and other expenses  net  increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in interest income  and interest and other expenses  net  was primarily attributable to slightly increased investment yields resulting from higher balance of invested cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we expect that interest income  and interest and other expenses  net  for the first quarter of fiscal will be approximately million  absent any additional transactions  and assuming no material changes in interest rates 
interest income  and interest and other expenses  net  increased by million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in interest income  and interest and other expenses  net  was primarily attributable to increased investment yields resulting from higher market interest rates earned on our invested cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
provision for benefit from income taxes change change in thousands provision for benefit from income taxes for the year ended september   we recorded a net tax expense of approximately million 
our effective tax rate for the year ended september  was approximately including the effect of the adjustment of the valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of the year  we recorded deferred income tax expense of approximately million associated with an increase in the valuation allowance against our net deferred assets 
this increase was primarily due to net loss incurred in fiscal and recent history of losses 
table of contents for the year ended september   we recorded a net tax expense of approximately million 
our effective tax rate for the year ended september  was approximately including the effect of the adjustment of the valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of the year  we recorded deferred income tax expense of approximately million associated with an increase in the valuation allowance against our net deferred assets 
this increase was primarily due to net loss incurred in fiscal and in the second  third  and fourth quarters of fiscal  and updating of our estimates for future taxable income 
the tax rate differed from the statutory rates primarily due to nondeductible stock option compensation charges related to incentive stock options  an effective foreign tax rate that is less than the us statutory and the change in the company s valuation allowance 
we establish liabilities or reserves when we believe that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed  despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves  as well as related interest  in light of changing circumstances such as the progress of tax examinations and the expiration of the statute of limitations 
we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not utilized  in the years through in addition  we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income for state income tax purposes 
the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not utilized  in the years through as of september   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal and million for state income tax purposes individually available to reduce future income taxes 
the federal research credit carryforwards begin to expire in the year the california research credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is management s intention to reinvest such undistributed earnings indefinitely in those foreign subsidiaries 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at september  if we distribute these earnings  in the form of dividends and otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes net of applicable foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the foreign jurisdiction 
federal and california tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
we have preliminarily determined that ownership changes have occurred  and the effects of the limitations have been included in the loss and credit carryforwards 
if an ownership change has occurred at different dates or in addition to the dates preliminarily identified  the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be significantly reduced

cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments held at major banks  commercial paper  money market funds and other money market securities with original maturities of three months or less 
short term investments consist of investment grade corporate and government debt securities with moody s ratings of a or better 
cash flows from operating activities we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  and the timing and amount of tax and other payments 
our largest source of operating cash flow is cash collections from our customers for our subscription services  ratable licenses and professional services 
payments from customers for subscription services are generally collected in the beginning of the subscription period  ranging from one to twelve months or monthly during the life of the subscription period 
payments for our ratable licenses are generally collected by the delivery of the sigos site system 
payments from some of our customers are collected at the end of the monthly service period or as milestones are completed 
our primary use of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  payment of insurance  regulatory compliance and other expenses for the operations of our business 
comparison of years ended september  and for the year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million which was primarily due to a net loss of million  adjusted for all non cash amortization  depreciation charges and stock based compensation 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in accounts receivable 
the increase in deferred revenue is primarily attributable to keynote sigos where of the cash is collected upon acceptance of the sigos site system  but revenue is being recognized over the maintenance period  which typically ranges from to months period 
the decrease in accounts receivable is due to improved collections as evidenced by our lower dso in fiscal as compared to fiscal comparison of years ended september  and for the year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million which was primarily due to net loss  adjusted for all non cash amortization and depreciation charges  stock based compensation  and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred revenue 
the decrease in net income in compared to  after excluding non cash items was primarily offset by an increase in deferred revenue of approximately million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to increased spending in audit and tax services related to regulatory compliance and increased expenses related to our most recent acquisition in april  as well as timing of payments related to marketing programs 

table of contents cash flow from investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases and maturities of investments 
we also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth and infrastructure 
comparison of years ended september  and cash flows from investing activities decreased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to the net purchases of short term investments  the cash paid for the keynote sigos earnout  and to a lesser extent  the cash used for the payment of fixed assets 
comparison of years ended september  and cash flows from investing activities decreased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to the cash paid for the sigos acquisition  and to a lesser extent  due to decreased proceeds from maturities of marketable securities  net of purchases 
cash flows from financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to payments made for stock repurchases and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
comparison of years ended september  and cash flows from financing activities increased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to modest repurchases of our common stock in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  the increase was attributable to higher proceeds received from the issuance of common stock associated with employees exercising stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
we utilized approximately million and million to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market during the years ended september  and  respectively

commitments and contractual obligations as of september   our principal commitments consisted of approximately million in real property and automobile operating leases and capital and equipment operating leases  with various lease terms  the longest of which expires in august additionally  we had contingent commitments ranging in length from one to twenty one months to bandwidth and co location providers amounting to  in the aggregate for locations  which commitments become due if we terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
at present  we do not intend to terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
we expect to continue to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth 
we expect to make additional capital expenditures of approximately million related to our operations and headquarters building for the first quarter of fiscal  absent any other acquisitions or extraordinary transactions 

table of contents the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands payment due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations capital leases contractual obligations operating leases contingent commitments bandwidth and collocation total we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  commitments and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
factors that could affect our cash position include potential acquisitions  additional stock repurchases  decreases in customers or renewals  decreases in revenue or changes in the value of our short term investments 
if  after some period of time  cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the term of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements may be impacted 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in a unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us 
indemnification we generally do not indemnify customers for our measuring  monitoring and testing web based applications against legal claims that our products and services infringe on third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by us may include indemnification provisions that we could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against us or an indemnified third party 
however  we have never been a party to an infringement claim and in the opinion of management  we do not have a liability related to any infringement claims subject to indemnification and as such  there is no material adverse affect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations

in september  the us securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public companies quantify and evaluate financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying and evaluating the effects of financial statement misstatements i the balance sheet iron curtain method and ii the income statement rollover method 
the iron curtain method quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the reporting period 
the rollover method quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current period income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements 
the use of the rollover method can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
prior to the adoption of sab  we historically used the rollover method for quantifying and evaluating identified financial statement misstatements 
by issuing sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification and evaluation of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements under both the iron curtain and rollover methods 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach 

table of contents sab requires companies to initially apply its provisions either by i restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been applied or ii recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal year  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of accumulated deficit 
we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal we elected to record the effects of applying sab using the cumulative effect transition method and  as such  recorded a million reduction in accumulated deficit as of october  the following table summarizes the effects of applying sab for each period in which the identified misstatement originated through september  in thousands period in which misstatement originated a cumulative adjustment prior fiscal years ended recorded as of september  september  october  accounts receivable billing adjustments b accounts payable and accrued expenses foreign entities and acquirees c accrued expenses bandwidth and connection fees d accrued expenses professional fees e accrued expenses facility insurance and other costs f accrued expenses annual report printing costs g accrued expenses property taxes and related costs h accrued expenses acquisition related i accrued expenses various j impact on net income loss and accumulated deficit   k a we previously quantified these errors under the rollover method and concluded that they were immaterial  individually and in the aggregate  to our consolidated financial statements 
b we maintain a billing allowance that represents the reserve for potential billing adjustments that are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
we determined that the allowance included estimated amounts in excess of subsequent billing adjustments that had not been relieved in the appropriate period 
c numerous vendor invoices  and accrued expenses  pertaining to foreign entities and acquirees were subsequently paid but the related amounts recorded in accounts payable were not relieved 
d certain accrued expenses for estimated bandwidth and connection fees had been recorded in excess of amounts listed on vendor invoices subsequently received and the excess accrued expense balance was not relieved 
e certain accrued expenses for audit  tax return preparation fees  and legal fees  had been recorded in excess of amounts listed on vendor invoices subsequently received 
the remaining accrued expense balances were not relieved 
f accrued expenses associated with our headquarters facility  such as insurance  and facilities labor  charges had been recorded in excess of amounts listed on vendor invoices subsequently received and the remaining accrued expense balance was not relieved 
g accrued expenses associated with the costs of producing our annual reports  such as creating  printing  and mailing costs had been recorded in excess of amounts listed on vendor invoices subsequently received and the remaining accrued expense balance was not relieved 
h pertains to accrued property taxes associated with the purchase of our headquarters building 
originally  the headquarters building was accounted for as a synthetic lease 
when the building was purchased in september  we recorded a loss on termination of the lease which was calculated by comparing the purchase price of the building to its fair value 
a third party was engaged to assist with reducing the property taxes such that the property taxes would be based on the new market value instead of the original purchase price 
the property tax accruals were related to costs of the third party vendor  related legal costs  and the 
table of contents potential property taxes based on the difference between the original purchase price and new market value 
in fiscal  we successfully finalized the property tax audits for the years in question and are currently paying property taxes on the current market value rather than the original purchase price 
when the property tax audits were completed  the accruals were not relieved 
i accrued liabilities associated with the settlement of accounts payable balances of an acquiree in excess of final amounts paid to the vendors 
j accrued expenses associated with tax return preparation  consulting fees  preparation of the annual report  holiday events  and annual meeting with sales force  recorded prior to the periods in which the expenses were incurred 
k represents the net reduction to accumulated deficit recorded as of october  to reflect the initial application of sab no 
the effect of these misstatements on our results of operations for the first three quarters of the year ended september  was not significant 
we determined that there was no tax impact as a result of the misstatements described above as the tax impact would have been offset with a corresponding change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies 
we have not and currently do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
our interest income and expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in short term debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by ten percent from levels at september   the interest earned on those cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments could increase or decrease by approximately  on an annualized basis 
foreign currency fluctuations and derivative transactions 
a substantial majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the euro and british pounds 
we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes 
revenues derived from customers outside of the united states  of which are billed from our headquarters  in san mateo  ca  and have the us dollar as the functional currency are collected in foreign currencies 
revenues derived from customers outside of the united states  of which are billed from our nuremberg office are typically billed in euros 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our international subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
net foreign exchange transaction gains losses included in interest and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations totaled   and  for the years ended september    and  respectively
