item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations some information contained in the management s discussion and analysis is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties 
the company operates in a cyclical industry and the results achieved this year are not necessarily an indication of future prospects for the company 
actual results in future years may differ materially 
potential risks and uncertainties include  among others  fluctuations in the volume and timing of product orders  changes in demand for the company s products  changes in technology  continued competitive pressures in the marketplace  outcomes of environmental contingencies  availability of raw materials  the ability to pass on raw material price increases  foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
overview the company produces and sells intermediate chemicals that are used in a wide variety of applications worldwide 
the overall business comprises three reportable segments surfactants  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  are principal ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning products such as detergents for washing clothes  dishes  carpets  floors and walls  as well as shampoos  lotions  fabric softeners  toothpastes and cosmetics 
other applications include biodiesel  germicidal quaternary compounds  lubricating ingredients  emulsifiers for spreading agricultural products and plastics and composites 
surfactants are manufactured at six north american sites five in the us and one in canada  three european sites united kingdom  france and germany and three latin american sites mexico  brazil and colombia 
polymers polymers  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  include three primary product lines phthalic anhydride  polyols and polyurethane systems 
phthalic anhydride is used in polyester alkyd resins and plasticizers for applications in construction materials and components of automotive  boating and other consumer products 
polyols are used in the manufacture of laminate insulation board for the construction industry and are also sold to the appliance  coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers markets 
polyurethane systems provide thermal insulation and are sold to the construction  industrial and appliance markets 
in the us  polymer product lines are manufactured at its millsdale  illinois  site 
the company also manufactures polyols at its wesseling cologne  germany facility  as well as at its joint venture in nanjing  china 
specialty products specialty products  which accounted for two percent of consolidated net sales for  include flavors  emulsifiers and solubilizers used in the food and pharmaceutical industries 
specialty products are manufactured primarily at its maywood  new jersey  site 

table of contents because of the diverse markets it serves  the company has numerous competitors 
the company generally competes on price  product performance and the ability to meet specific needs of customers 
in some instances  particularly in the surfactants segment  the company competes with internal manufacturing capabilities of its customers 
this situation can lead to large period to period sales volume swings when such customers decide to manufacture in house product that the company once supplied 
in addition  the company s manufacturing costs are relatively fixed in nature 
as a result  gross profit defined as net sales less cost of sales is susceptible to disproportionate declines when volume decreases 
a number of the company s key raw materials and energy sources are commodities  principally petroleum based and plant based materials and natural gas used to power the company s manufacturing facilities  whose prices fluctuate due to weather  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
from through  raw material costs escalated due to instability in the middle east and tight supplies 
increased raw material costs are passed on to customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements with the company that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent cost increases from being passed on to customers  particularly in periods when there is excess industry capacity 
accordingly  some product lines or market segments may take time to recover raw material cost increases 
the company raised selling prices numerous times throughout  and  which aided in stemming further profit margin erosion 
however  the current profit margin relative to net sales continues to lag behind historical levels 
increasing costs will continue to be passed on to customers as quickly as the market will allow 
the company continues to seek ways to control and reduce its operating expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  the company announced a plan to restructure the business functions within its european surfactants organization 
the restructuring is an effort to create operational efficiencies and cut costs by centralizing various positions and eliminating functional redundancies 
the current year operating results include million in severance expenses related to the staffing reorganization 
it is anticipated that the effort will result in future annual pretax savings of approximately million  with partial savings realized in and full savings realized annually beginning in the company s administrative expenses are subject to period to period fluctuations due principally to the accounting for the company s deferred compensation plans and to obligations associated with environmental remediation and related legal issues 
the company operates in a setting of extensive local  state and federal regulations concerning the environment 
the company has been named as a potentially responsible party to perform environmental remediation at the company s expense  at a number of geographic sites 
the company believes it has adequate reserves for all known environmental sites  but an adverse determination could result in a significant negative effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
expenses related to legal and environmental matters increased million from to from to  such expenses declined million 
expense related to the company s deferred compensation plans increased million and million between and and between and  respectively 
not included in administrative expenses is the income earned by the mutual fund investments held by the company to fund its deferred compensation obligations 
the investment income is included in the other  net line in the other income expense section of the consolidated statements of income 
the pre tax effect of deferred compensation related activities is displayed below dollars in millions income expense for the years ended december deferred compensation administrative expense investment income other  net net pre tax income effect 
table of contents for further discussions of these matters  see the environmental and legal matters and critical accounting policies sections of this management discussion and analysis 
in  the company is focused on commercializing its newest polyol  growing its global fabric softener franchise  larger scale commercialization of sulfonated methyl esters for the surfactant marketplace and securing long term value for its biodiesel business initiative 
biodiesel earnings are forecast to be lower in due to lower crude oil and higher soybean oil pricing 
the company continues to explore tallow as an alternate feedstock to soybean oil for biodiesel 
the company is also pursuing additional distribution outlets to reduce some of the inherent risk in the biodiesel business 
the lower crude oil prices that are expected to adversely affect biodiesel margins should help the company s core operating segments through lower raw material costs 
results of operations compared with summary net income for declined percent to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for asset retirement obligations  net income was million  or per diluted share 
operating income for fell million  or percent  from operating income reported in the decline in operating income reflected a million increase in legal and environmental expenses  a million increase in deferred compensation expense and million of fourth quarter severance expense related to the restructuring of the company s europe surfactants organization 
included in the legal and environmental expense increase was a million fourth quarter settlement for personal injury claims associated with the company s previously owned wilmington  massachusetts site sold in 
in addition to the foregoing  the prior year income results benefited from million of insurance settlement income related to the fire at the company s united kingdom subsidiary  million in non recurring income related to a us department of agriculture biodiesel incentive income and a large non recurring polyurethane systems sales contract 
below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the year to year changes in net sales  profits and expenses 
a detailed discussion of segment operating performance for follows the summary 

table of contents consolidated net sales for increased million  or nine percent  higher than consolidated net sales for all reportable segments reported year to year increases in net sales 
increases in selling prices  due primarily to the pass through of higher raw material costs  along with a favorable mix of surfactants sales and greater polymers volume led to the increase in net sales 
consolidated sales volume increased one percent from year to year 
higher average selling prices and the small sales volume increase accounted for approximately million and million of the net sales growth  respectively 
the favorable effects of foreign currency translations accounted for about million of the year to year change 
operating income for was million  or percent  lower than operating income for gross profit was up million  or two percent  while operating expenses increased million  or percent 
the surfactants segment accounted for most of the gross profit increase as results for north america operations improved due to higher selling prices and a more favorable customer and product mix 
also  increased latin america sales volume contributed to the higher surfactants profits 
gross profit for the polymers segment was up less than one percent from year to year as the effects of higher raw material costs  particularly for foreign operations  and a drop in sales volume for polyurethane systems largely offset the effect of sales volume growth for the polyols product line 
gross profit for the specialty products segment dropped due to higher raw material costs 
in addition to the foregoing  consolidated gross profit benefited from the previously mentioned stepan uk insurance income and the us department of agriculture biodiesel incentive income 
the percent increase in operating expenses was attributable to a million  or percent  increase in administrative expenses and a million  or six percent  increase in marketing expenses 
the above noted europe severance expenses and increases in legal  deferred compensation and consulting expenses accounted for most of the increase in administrative expenses 
see the corporate expense section of this discussion for additional details about the year to year changes in legal  deferred compensation and consulting expenses 
approximately half of the marketing expense increase was attributable to higher us salary expense 
personnel transfers from research areas into the us marketing organization coupled with normal pay increases caused most of the salary expense increase 
on a combined basis  marketing and research expense grew million  or three percent  due to higher salary expense 
interest expense increased million  or percent  between years due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt levels 
the higher average interest rates reflected a greater mix of long term fixed rate debt 
the company made a planned shift to a larger proportion of fixed rate debt in the final quarter of in addition  current year interest rates on short term borrowings were higher than those for the same period of the inflationary impact of crude and natural oils on raw material costs led to higher levels of working capital resulting in the higher average debt levels 
other  net  which includes foreign exchange gains and losses and investment related income and expense  was million of income for compared to million of income for higher investment income generated by the mutual funds held for deferred compensation purposes accounted for the entire million year to year increase 
the effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increased level of biodiesel tax credits 
table of contents that were established as part of the american jobs creation act of and the energy tax incentives act of currently scheduled to expire december  
the decrease was also due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in germany for which valuation allowances had previously been recorded and to the favorable effect of a new tax law in mexico that reduced the current year tax provision

the average selling price was up seven percent between years 
the effects of selling price increases and the more favorable mix of sales more than offset the effect of a three percent drop in sales volume 
most of the sales volume decline was attributable to a percent fall in commodity laundry products  which resulted from customer product reformulations and market share fluctuations 
higher selling prices reflected the pass through of rising raw material costs to customers 
the improved customer and product mix reflected higher 
table of contents sales volumes for the distributor and specialty foamers market  as focused efforts have proved successful in these markets 
these products carry higher selling prices and are more profitable than commodity laundry products 
in addition  current year sales volume for biodiesel products was up percent over last year s sales volume and resulted in million of additional net sales 
higher selling prices and a percent growth in sales volume accounted for the percent improvement in net sales for latin america operations 
all three latin america subsidiaries reported higher net sales 
growth in fabric softener sales drove latin america net sales and sales volume gains 
the seven percent year to year improvement in net sales for european operations resulted from a three percent increase in sales volume and average selling prices and million related to the favorable effects of foreign currency translations 
a more favorable mix of sales coupled with increased selling prices  particularly for stepan uk  contributed to the increase in average selling prices

the selling price increases reflected the company s ongoing efforts to recapture margin lost due to higher raw material costs 
higher sales volumes for the distributor and specialty foamers product lines accounted for the improved mix 
as noted earlier  sales for these product lines are more profitable than sales for the commodity laundry product line  which accounted for the reduced north america

gross profit for the biodiesel product line fell million  or four percent  from year to year despite greater sales volume 
gross profit in included million of income for incentives received from the us department of agriculture for increasing biodiesel production 
the incentive program was discontinued during the biodiesel business generated million of us income tax credits that are not reflected in gross profit or operating income  but are included in the full year tax provision 
latin america s nine percent gross profit improvement resulted from the percent sales volume increase noted above 
stepan brazil accounted for most of the latin america gross profit improvement due to increased sales volume 
stepan mexico s gross profit was essentially unchanged between years 
the company is expanding its mexican fabric softener capacity to meet increased demand 
gross profit for european operations fell eight percent from year to year primarily as a result of the non recurring nature of the aforementioned insurance income

surfactants segment operating expenses for increased million  or six percent  over operating expenses due principally to the million of europe severance expense 
the remainder of the year to year variance was primarily attributable to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation 
polymers polymers segment net sales increased million  or percent  over net sales for higher selling prices and a seven percent increase in sales volume accounted for approximately million and million of the net sales improvement  respectively 
the favorable effects of foreign currency translation added million to the increase 
a year to year comparison of net sales by region is displayed below for the year ended dollars in thousands december  december  increase decrease percent change north america europe asia and other total polymers segment higher average selling prices  due primarily to the pass through of raw material cost increases  accounted for the eight percent increase in net sales for north america operations 
sales volume was essentially unchanged from year to year 
sales volumes were up four percent and one percent for the phthalic anhydride and polyol product lines  respectively  but sales volume for polyurethane systems dropped percent 
in  north america polyol sales volume included the unusual sale of two barges of raw materials 
excluding the raw material sales  north america polyol sales volume increased five percent between years as the downturn in roofing insulation board demand that began in the second half of subsided somewhat in a nonrecurring large sales contract that was filled in the second quarter of coupled with the loss of business at three customers drove a decline in sales volume for polyurethane 
table of contents systems 
the year to year increase in net sales for european operations resulted from a percent increase in polyol sales volume 
the higher sales volume was the effect of concentrated efforts to recover market share that was lost in due to competitive pressures 
the significant increase in net sales for asia and other regions was due to increased sales volume of polyol generated by the company s china joint venture 
sales volume improved four fold as the venture continued to attract new business 
stepan china commenced manufacturing operations in the second quarter of polymers operating income fell million  or two percent  from operating income for gross profit increased million from year to year  while operating expenses increased million 
the prior year s profit results benefited from a large polyurethane systems sales contract that was completely filled in the second quarter of the current year s profit results benefited from million of income related to the settlement of a claim for to an electrical outage in the company s phthalic anhydride plant precipitated by an undersized transformer installed by the company s electricity provider the entire claim settlement was million  of which million was allocated to the surfactants segment

the settlement income related to the electric outage also contributed 
selling price increases for polyols enabled the business to continue recovering margin lost from persistent rising material costs 
on average  selling prices for north america polymers were eight percent higher than selling prices for despite higher sales volume  european operations reported an million  or percent  drop in gross profit between years primarily due to higher raw material costs that were difficult to entirely recapture with selling price increases 
in  the europe operation benefited from a contractual arrangement that offered favorable raw material prices that did not carry into the china joint venture reported gross profit that was less than that reported in  as the effect of higher sales volume was more than offset by higher raw material costs 
competitive situations made it difficult to raise selling prices in china enough to cover the increased raw material costs 

table of contents north america operations accounted for the million  or five percent  year to year operating expense increase 
marketing expenses were up million and research and development expenses were up million 
numerous small variances accounted for the increase in marketing expenses  including salary and travel related expenses 
specialty products net sales for were million  or seven percent  higher than net sales reported for all product lines reported improved net sales on higher sales volumes 
despite higher sales volume  operating income declined million  or percent  between years due primarily to higher raw material costs for the segment s food ingredients product line 
competitive pressures impeded the company from raising selling prices 
a million  or percent  increase in operating expenses  due mainly to a higher allocation of research expenses related to the pharmaceutical product line  contributed to the operating income decline

gross profit for was up million  or percent  over gross profit for on a consolidated basis  gross profit as a percent of net sales declined to percent in from percent in  due primarily to cost increases outpacing selling price increases 
polymers and surfactants gross profits were up million and million  respectively  between years  and specialty products gross profit was down million 
selling price increases implemented to mitigate the negative effects of rising material costs that eroded profit margins drove the polymers profit improvement 
the increase in surfactants gross profit resulted from higher sales volume  particularly for the company s foreign entities and domestic biodiesel product  and million in insurance proceeds related to the september fire at the company s uk subsidiary 
higher utility and labor expenses tempered the gross profit improvement 
lower sales volume  especially for the food ingredients product line  led to the drop in specialty products gross profit

in july  the company established defined contribution plans whereby fixed company contributions are made to the 
table of contents accounts of eligible participants based on participants base earnings 
the company does not expect any full year savings in the near future  as the expense related to the defined contribution plans is expected to offset any reduction in defined benefit pension expense 
the volatility in pension expense should decline 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the company s post retirement plans 
in august  the pension protection act of ppa was signed into law

environmental and legal matters the company s operations are subject to extensive local  state and federal regulations 
although the company s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  future developments and increasingly stringent environmental regulation could require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
the company will continue to invest in the equipment and facilities necessary to comply with existing and future regulations 
during  the company s expenditures for capital projects related to the environment were million 
these projects are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  which is typically years 
recurring costs associated with the operation and maintenance of facilities for waste treatment and disposal and managing environmental compliance in ongoing operations at our manufacturing locations were approximately million for  million for and million for while difficult to project  it is not anticipated that these recurring expenses will increase significantly in the future 
over the years  the company has received requests for information related to or has been named by the government as a potentially responsible party at waste disposal sites where 
table of contents cleanup costs have been or may be incurred under cercla and similar state statutes 
in addition  damages are being claimed against the company in general liability actions for alleged personal injury or property damage in the case of some disposal and plant sites 
the company believes that it has made adequate provisions for the costs it may incur with respect to the sites 
it is the company s accounting policy to record liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
because reported liabilities are recorded based on estimates  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
after partial remediation payments at certain sites  the company has estimated a range of possible environmental and legal losses from million to million at december   compared to million to million at december  at december  the company s accrued liability for such losses  which represents the company s best estimate within the estimated range of possible environmental and legal losses  was million compared to million at december  during  non capital cash outlays related to legal and environmental matters approximated million compared to million expended in for certain sites  estimates cannot be made of the total costs of compliance or the company s share of such costs  accordingly  the company is unable to predict the effect thereof on future results of operations 
in the event of one or more adverse determinations in any annual or interim period  the impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations for those periods could be material 
however  based upon the company s present belief as to its relative involvement at these sites  other viable entities responsibilities for cleanup and the extended period over which any costs would be incurred  the company believes that these matters will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
certain of these matters are discussed in item  legal proceedings  in this report and in other filings of the company with the securities and exchange commission  which are available upon request from the company

critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the company believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
deferred compensation the company maintains deferred compensation plans 
these plans allow management to defer receipt of its bonuses and directors to defer receipt of director fees until retirement or departure 
table of contents from the company or as elected 
the company funds its obligations associated with these plans by purchasing investment assets that match the investment choices a limited selection of mutual funds or company common stock made by the plan participants 
the company maintains at least enough company common stock in treasury to cover the equivalent number of common stock shares resulting from participants electing the company common stock option  which periodically requires the company to purchase its common shares from the open market 
the plans allow for the compensation being deferred to grow or decline based on the results of investment options chosen by the participants 
ultimately  upon retirement or departure from the company  participants receive the cash equivalent value of the investment choices they have made as of the date of plan distribution 
as a result  any appreciation in the value of stepan company common stock or the mutual fund options under the plan result is additional compensation expense to the company 
conversely  declines in the market price of stepan company stock or the value of the mutual funds results in a reduction of compensation expense since such declines reduce the cash obligation of the company as of the date of the financial statements 
it is these market price movements that result in the significant period to period fluctuations that impact the company s consolidated statements of income 
at december   the company s deferred compensation liability was million  of which approximately percent represents deferred compensation tied to the performance of the company s common stock and the remainder is tied to the mutual fund investment choices 
a increase in the market price of the company s common stock will result in approximately million of additional compensation expense 
similarly  a reduction in the market price of the common stock will reduce compensation expense by a like amount 
the expense or income associated with the mutual fund component will fluctuate generally in line with the overall percentage increase or decrease of the us stock markets 
in december  the company  with prior board of director approval  adopted an amended and restated management incentive plan 
the amendment provided participants with an irrevocable election to transfer all or a portion of their deferred compensation accounts attributable to pre bonuses to an alternate company common stock investment option 
the number of share equivalents credited to the participants accounts for this option was based on the december   closing price of the company s common stock 
the share equivalents transferred to the alternate investment option can be distributed upon a participant s retirement or departure from the company only in shares of stepan company common stock ie  there can be no cash settlements of these amounts 
furthermore  such amounts cannot be transferred to the plan s other investment options 
as a result of the irrevocable election  the share equivalent amounts transferred to the participants deferred compensation accounts were treated as equity instruments 
therefore  the deferred compensation obligation that is tied to the alternate company common stock investment option is fixed and will not increase or decrease with the value of the company s common stock 
all future deferrals of bonuses to the company common stock investment option will be directed to the alternate company common stock investment option 
the company implemented this plan change to reduce some of the deferred compensation plan expense volatility as expense treatment is not required for future fluctuations in the value of these shares 
the mutual fund assets are recorded on the company s balance sheet at cost when acquired and adjusted to their market values at the end of each reporting period 
while these market value adjustments affect the income statement due to their impact on the company s 
table of contents ultimate cash liability  there is not an offsetting income statement impact from fluctuation in the asset value  as generally accepted accounting principles require unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable securities be recorded as a direct adjustment to shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
dividends and capital gains received from the mutual funds  as well as impairment losses and realized gains and losses from sales of mutual fund shares  are recognized as investment income loss under the other  net caption of the consolidated statements of income 
because the company s common stock is held as treasury stock  no further adjustments are made to equity as a result of market price movements in the stock 
environmental liabilities it is the company s accounting policy to record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
estimates for environmental liabilities are subject to significant fluctuations as new facts emerge related to the various sites where the company is exposed to liability for the remediation of environmental contamination 
see the environmental and legal matters section of this management s discussion and analysis for discussion of the company s reserves and range of loss estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
for arrangements where the company consigns product to a customer location  revenue is recognized when the customer uses the inventory 
the company records shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due to customers are estimated and recorded in the same period as the sales to which the discounts relate and reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
cost of sales comprises raw material costs  including inbound freight expense to deliver the raw materials  manufacturing plant labor expenses and various manufacturing overhead expenses  which include utility  maintenance  operating supply  amortization and manufacturing asset depreciation expenses 
cost of sales also includes outbound freight expenses  purchasing and receiving costs  quality assurance expenses  inter plant transfer costs and warehouse expenses 
marketing expense comprises salary and the related fringe benefit expenses for marketing and sales personnel and operating costs  such as outside agent commissions  automobile rental and travel related expenses  which support the sales and marketing functions 
bad debt charges and any depreciation expenses related to marketing assets eg computers are also classified as marketing expense 

table of contents administrative expense comprises salary and the related fringe benefit expenses and operating costs for the company s various administrative functions  which include information services  finance  legal  and human resources 
compensation expense related to the company s deferred compensation plans and legal and environmental expenses are also classified as administrative expense 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements  included in part ii  item  for information on recent accounting pronouncements  which affect the company 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk because the company operates in the global marketplace  its cash flows and operating results are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company manufactures and sells products in many foreign locations and  therefore  believes its currency exchange risk is well diversified 
except as noted below  substantially all the company s foreign subsidiaries financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
as such  exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign currency financial instruments is not considered significant 
gains or losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are included in income 
the company and its foreign subsidiaries periodically use short term forward exchange contracts to limit the exposure of certain foreign currency transactions and balances to fluctuating exchange rates 
as of december   the company s french subsidiary had one forward contract for the purchase of million in january from time to time  the company extends us dollar denominated loans or extended trade receivables to its foreign subsidiaries 
gains or losses on such transactions are recorded in income 
as of december   the company had trade receivables of million due from its brazilian subsidiary 
a hypothetical fluctuation of percent in the exchange rate of the brazilian real would result in a gain or loss of million 
interest rates the company s debt was composed of fixed rate and variable rate borrowings totaling million and million  respectively  as of december  for  it is projected that interest on variable rate borrowings will total approximately million 
a hypothetical percent average change to short term interest rates would result in a million increase or decrease to interest expense for the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december   which was approximately million above the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase to the fair value that would result from a hypothetical percent decrease in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rates at december   or million 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are subject to price volatility caused by weather  petroleum prices  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
increased raw material costs are passed on to customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent cost increases from being passed on to customers  particularly in periods where there is excess industry capacity 
as a result  for some product lines or market segments it may take time to recover raw material price increases 
periodically  firm purchase commitments are entered into which fix the price of a specific commodity that will be delivered at a future time 
forward contracts are sometimes used to aid 
table of contents in managing the company s natural gas costs 
the company may contract up to percent of its forecasted annual natural gas requirements 
at december   the company had open forward contracts for the purchase of million dekatherms of natural gas in at a cost of million 
a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of natural gas covered by forward contracts would result in the company s natural gas cost being million higher or lower than the contractual price in the company s results of operations
