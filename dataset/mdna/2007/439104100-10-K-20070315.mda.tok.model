this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report 
overview hooper holmes  inc and its subsidiaries currently engage in businesses that are managed as two separate divisions the health information division and the claims evaluation division 
our health information division hid provides medical related risk assessment information to life and health insurance carriers  information that is integral to such carriers underwriting decisions 
these services include arranging paramedical and medical examinations of individual insurance policy applicants mainly life insurance policy applicants throughout the united states under the portamedic brand name and in the united kingdom under the medicals direct brand name  performing telephone interviews of applicants and collecting applicants medical records  testing the blood  urine and other specimens obtained in connection with a portion of the paramedical examinations we coordinate  as well as specimens provided by third party health information service providers  and underwriting life insurance policies on an outsourced basis for life insurance companies 
our health information division accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
our core portamedic paramedical examination business accounted for of our hid revenue and of our total revenue in in and  portamedic accounted for and of hid revenues and and of our total revenues  respectively 
our claims evaluation division ced provides medical claims evaluation services to property and casualty p c insurance carriers  law firms  self insureds and third party administrators for use in processing personal injury accident claims 
the core activity of this business consists of arranging for independent medical exams imes 
an ime is a medical examination by a doctor other than a claimant s physician for the purpose of rendering an objective opinion regarding the nature  origin  treatment and causal relationship of an injury 
we provide our claims evaluation services in connection with automobile  liability  disability and workers compensation claims 
our claims evaluation division accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
status of our strategic review and turnaround program in the first quarter of  our management team initiated an extensive review of all aspects of the company s business 
the review was undertaken to assess our organizational strengths and challenges and to help plot a future course of action 
as a result of our review  management formulated a turnaround program to address the continuation of the negative financial trends we have been experiencing  particularly in our core portamedic business 
management anticipates that the company will pursue the financial and other goals of this program in three phases phase expense management phase revenue enhancement phase growth investment expense management in may  the company began a strategic review process which divided the company into teams  each with specific accountability and responsibility 
the process was led by an executive team  with support from external consultants  ehs partners 
although the strategic review s primary focus was expense management  there were also incremental revenue opportunities identified during this first phase of our turnaround program 
the company s strategic review was completed in september   at which time detailed plans were formulated to implement expense management initiatives identified during the review  along with the related incremental revenue opportunities 
the implementation period is expected to cover eight quarters  with the majority of the initiatives to be completed by december  the two year implementation period reflects management s decision to move in a careful  methodical manner in order to protect existing revenues and our ability to deliver client service 
management recognizes that our wholly owned branches  dedicated portamedic examiners  customer service representatives and branch managers are essential to our success 
management s plans  when fully implemented  are expected to result in approximately million of additional operating income on an annual basis  comprised of million in annual cost reductions and approximately million of additional operating income from new revenue initiatives 
the expected impact on gross margin of these plans is an increase of approximately million  with an expected sg a expense reduction of million 
for calendar year  management expects the plan initiatives should generate approximately million in cost reductions and million of additional operating income from revenue initiatives 
the expense management initiatives currently being implemented focus on aligning costs with revenues to improve operating margins  improving utilization of company assets  including a balancing of branch office volumes and operating costs  while eliminating geographic overlap among our branch offices  improving our information technology platform to generate cost efficiencies  consolidation of our regional service centers  and enhancing operational controls on a company wide basis with a focus on reducing costs 
the financial benefit of these expense management initiatives should begin to have a positive impact in our first quarter financial results 
revenue enhancement the focus of phase of our turnaround program  which began in the first quarter of  will be to reverse the decline in revenues and profitability we are experiencing in each of our two divisions and pursue opportunities for revenue enhancement 
as noted previously  although the focus of phase was primarily expense management  there were also revenue enhancement initiatives identified 
additional initiatives will be identified during phase which are expected to increase revenues 
these initiatives  including the revenue enhancement opportunities already implemented  consist of seeking opportunities to grow and expand our current services by delivering new and increased value to our customers 
the life insurance market in the united states continues to decline based on the reduction in life insurance activity 
in order to stabilize and ultimately grow our portamedic market share in a flat or declining market  we need to deliver higher levels of service  speed and quality  which we believe are critical metrics to our customers success  increasing the number of local sales and marketing people calling upon local insurance agents in our portamedic business 
while we have national contracts with a large number of leading insurance carriers  the majority of our portamedic business is generated locally through our branch offices and the local insurance agents and brokers they serve 
we are also increasing the sales force in our other businesses  including heritage labs  maas and the claims evaluation division 
in addition  sales incentive plans have been implemented in for all sales personnel of the company  introducing new products and services which address the critical business needs of new and existing customers and  as a result  provide additional revenue opportunities for our company  and obtaining price increases from customers in response to improved service levels provided by the company  along with charging for ancillary services not currently charged for  but in conformance with industry standards eg cancellation fees  eg we believe that the revenue enhancement initiatives described above should help stabilize revenue declines experienced by our company over the past several years 
growth investment the final phase of our turnaround program is growth investment 
beginning in the second half of  with the benefits of our reduced cost structure  we plan to pursue a phase of organic growth 
this phase will include our development of an optimal growth strategy which focuses on our core capabilities 
we believe that the wellness and disease management markets present a major opportunity to leverage our core capabilities  primarily our ability to deliver medical examinations at any location in the us  along with the related lab testing and fulfillment services 
as health care premiums continue to rise approximately annually in the last years  wellness and disease management programs have developed into a large market which continues to grow at approximately per annum 
most major corporations are turning to the wellness market for services and methodologies to control and reduce health care costs ie  identify and mitigate employee health risks  before the risks result in an expensive medical claim 
we believe that our core capabilities represent a significant asset to current and potential wellness customers  including the ability to schedule medical screenings for large groups of employees  manufacture the necessary collection kits  conduct group screenings at any location and analyze and transmit the related medical data 
in addition to the wellness market  we will continue to leverage our core skills to extend our current services into new growth markets 
all organic and acquisition opportunities identified during this phase will be screened for growth potential  profitability and risk 
conversely  we continually evaluate each of our current business units based on their growth potential  expected return on equity and strategic importance to our turnaround program  in order to ensure we are investing only in those businesses which we believe offer the greatest potential sustainable return to our shareholders 
key factors and industry trends affecting our businesses our revenue  profitability and cash flows are directly affected by the demand for our services  the prices we can charge for the services we provide  the relative volume of the higher margin services we provide relative to services with lower margins  and our efforts to grow our business and manage our operating and other expenses 
in the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the businesses that comprise our health information division and our claims evaluation division have been influenced by several key factors or trends  discussed below 
health information division decline in life insurance application activity we believe that the level of life insurance application activity in the united states and in the united kingdom had a significant effect on the businesses that comprise our health information division 
in general  the lower the level of application activity  the lower the demand for our paramedical examination  tele underwriting  lab specimen testing and outsourced underwriting services 
based on data available from the medical information bureau group  inc mib  a clearinghouse of policy application information based in westwood  massachusetts that is owned by participants in the insurance industry  it appears that life insurance application activity in north america has declined during each of the last four years 
the mib life index is the life insurance industry s timeliest measure of application activity across the united states and canada 
the index is based on the number of searches member company underwriters perform on the mib database 
since the vast majority of individually underwritten life insurance policies in north america include a mib search as a routine underwriting requirement  the mib life index provides what our management believes is a reliable proxy for new application activity 
the mib data suggest a decline in application activity of in  in  in and in our volume of paramedical examinations performed in has declined at a higher rate in and in the mib data is consistent with a fundamental change that has been occurring within the life insurance industry over a number of years  that is the reported shift in consumers preferences away from individual life insurance and toward other wealth accumulation and investment products  such as annuities and mutual funds 
we also believe that we have lost market share for the services we provide to the insurance industry from through mid in an attempt to reverse this loss  management has implemented several initiatives  including the hiring of additional salespersons in the fourth quarter of  along with implementing sales incentive plans for all sales personnel of the company 
pricing pressure from life insurance carriers for the past several years  we have experienced downward pricing pressure from our life insurance carrier customers 
we attribute this pressure to the carriers efforts to address cost issues in a more rigorous manner in an attempt to maintain their profitability and level of return to their stakeholders 
as discussed in item business sales and marketing health information division  our core portamedic business must negotiate with the headquarters offices of life insurance carriers to get on their lists of approved outside risk assessment service providers 
in the past  those negotiations have increasingly focused on pricing levels as carriers have focused on lowering their costs 
however  as we improve our levels of service  speed and quality  we believe we can offer improved value to certain customers  which should help mitigate past pricing declines 
in addition  we anticipate that life insurance carriers cost containment objectives will serve to increase the level of interest and demand for tele interviewing underwriting and for outsourced underwriting services  both of which we believe further those objectives 
accordingly  we see our businesses that provide those services as having growth potential 
claims evaluation division contraction of the outsourced claims management market in the united states our management perceives that the outsourced medical claims management market in the united states  including the market for the claims evaluation division s claims evaluation services  may be contracting 
there are a number of factors that may be contributing to this trend  including the decrease in manufacturing employment levels in the united states and the associated decline in the rates of workplace injuries and  in turn  workers compensation claims  the reported decline in the number of people injured in automobile accidents in the united states  and changes in state laws and regulations that  in general  encourage the use of managed care techniques in handling workers compensation and automobile related personal injury insurance claims 
managed care laws generally channel claimants into provider networks and suggest treatment protocols and other constraints on the activity of the physician practitioners in such networks 
in addition to the factors cited above  the market for claims evaluation services in new york where a significant portion of the ced s revenues were derived in the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report has been adversely affected by the implementation of regulatory changes for example  shortening the period of time for filing a personal injury and property claim and efforts to curb auto injury insurance fraud 
write down of long lived assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of  the company s management initiated our annual testing for impairment of goodwill  in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements 
we also deemed it appropriate to test for impairment of long lived assets  since certain impairment indicators were present 
during the course of the testing process  we considered a number of events and circumstances that constitute impairment indicators under the literature  including a preliminary expectation that the operating loss in the fourth quarter of was going to be greater than our fourth quarter forecast  the completion of our operating budget that reflected an assumption that some of the negative trends adversely affecting the company s results discussed above would continue to a greater extent than our previous forecasts for and thereafter and notification during the fourth quarter of a further decline in projected revenue for from a major customer within the maas business 
upon completion of the impairment tests  we recorded non cash impairment charges to long lived assets and goodwill of million and million  respectively 
for more information regarding these impairment charges  see the discussion under results of operations impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
key financial and other metrics monitored by management in our periodic reports filed with the sec  we provide certain financial information and metrics about our businesses and each of our two segments  information that our management uses in evaluating the company s performance and financial condition 
our objective in providing this information is to help our shareholders and investors generally understand our overall performance and assess the profitability of our businesses and our prospects for future net cash flows 
in  our management primarily focused on tracking our actual results relative to our forecasts and budgets  and measuring the degree of success of efforts to align our costs with lower revenue levels 
with respect to our health information division  our management monitors the following metrics the mib life index data  which  as discussed previously  serves as a proxy for the level of life insurance application activity and indirectly serves to give us a sense of changes in our market share  the number of paramedical examinations and screenings performed by portamedic and medicals direct  respectively  the average revenue per paramedical examination  time service performance  from examination order to completion  the number of tele interviewing underwriting reports we generate  the number of specimens tested by our heritage labs subsidiary  the average revenue per specimen tested  budget to actual performance at the branch level as well as in the aggregate  and customer and product line profitability 
with respect to our claims evaluation division  our management monitors the following metrics the number of incoming cases by client and by insurance adjuster  time of service  which measures the time to complete a claim  from receipt to issuing a report  and budget to actual financial performance  including customer and product line profitability 
certain of the above cited metrics are discussed in the comparative discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows 
results of operations comparative discussion and analysis of results of operations in  and the table below sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations and other data  and certain key statistics  for the periods indicated 
revenues by component businesses and reporting segments in thousands for the years ended december change change hid portamedic infolink medicals direct group mdg other total hid ced total revenues consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decline of million or from the corresponding period of the prior year 
the revenue for the year ended december  was million or million and below the same period in the prior year 
as explained in greater detail below  similar market forces influenced the revenues and operating results of our two divisions  and the component businesses within our health information division throughout the three year period ended december  health information division our health information division s hid revenues of million for the year ended december  were million or below the prior year 
revenues for the year ended december  were million or below the corresponding period in the prior year 
portamedic the decline in revenues of our portamedic business has been the primary reason for the decline in hid revenues 
the decline in portamedic revenues for the years ended december  and reflected a combination of fewer paramedical examinations performed   in   in  and  in  and lower average revenue per paramedical examination  in  in  and in we attribute a portion of the reduction in the number of paramedical examinations performed in and to a decline in life insurance application activity in the united states as reported by the mib life index and therefore the need for fewer paramedical examinations 
we also believe that we have lost market share for the services we provide to the insurance industry from through mid in an attempt to reverse this loss  management has implemented several initiatives  including the hiring of additional salespersons in the fourth quarter of  along with implementing sales incentive plans for all sales personnel of the company 
in addition  the reduction in revenue in reflects the continuing effect of the loss of a significant customer which began in the first quarter of  and accounted for approximately of the portamedic s revenues in and in in  two customers were lost  the total of both customers revenue accounted for of portamedic s revenues in the lower average revenue per exam is primarily attributable to downward pricing pressure in both and from our insurance company customers in an effort to control their costs 
infolink our infolink business tele underwriting interviewing and attending physician statement aps retrieval  which represents the larger of the two infolink revenue components increased to million for the full year of versus the same period of the prior year 
this increase in revenue reflects an increase in the number of tele interviewing units partially offset by a reduced number of aps units 
the tele interviewing business  which represents of the infolink revenue  continues to grow significantly  with growth in units at 
the increase in our tele interviewing business results primarily from new customer volume and increases at existing customers 
aps revenues  which represents of the infolink revenue  is down from this is due to both a decline in units and average price 
tele interviewing has become an increasingly accepted practice by insurance companies because of its time and cost advantages 
the decrease in aps units for the year ended december   is primarily attributable to the decline in aps orders during the period in which branch office aps services were consolidated to our centralized facility in kansas city 
the consolidation  which is now complete  should improve the quality and reduce the time service for aps retrieval  which we believe will result in an increase in orders in our revenues in from our infolink business was million  an increase of compared to the increase is attributable to an increase in customers utilizing our tele underwriting services  along with an increased number of reports requested from existing customers 
medicals direct group medicals direct group s mdg revenues were down million or  compared to the prior year 
of this amount  approximately million or represents a decline in mdg s revenue  partially offset by a favorable change in the pound sterling us average exchange rate of million or 
the decline in mdg s revenues excluding the foreign exchange impact for the full year of is primarily attributable to a decrease in mdg s outsourced underwriting business of million or and a decrease in mdg s medical screening business of million or  partially offset by incremental revenue of million from the january acquisition of doctors direct 
mdg s outsourced underwriting business represented approximately of its total revenues for the year ended december  three of mdg s underwriting clients terminated their contracts in due to a reduction in their volumes of life insurance applications  while several other clients reduced their use of mdg s underwriting services 
the screenings business nurse and physician exams represented of mdg s total revenues for the year ended december  the reduction in revenues primarily resulted from a combined revenue decline of million from two of mdg s customers 
partially offsetting these declines are both revenues from new customers and volume increases from other existing accounts 
reductions in both the underwriting and screenings businesses resulted from declining life insurance policy sales and therefore  the need for mdg s services 
declines in policy sales is partially attributable to the decline in the u 
k housing market  among other factors  which is a key driver in purchasing life insurance policies in the uk medicals direct group mdg experienced an increase in revenues of million  or in compared to mdg s results in reflect substantial growth in revenues derived by mdg s definitech physician exams business  up over this business represented approximately of mdg s revenues in  an increase in revenues derived by mdg s underwriting business  which represented approximately of mdg s revenues in  a decline in mdg s revenues from screenings  reflecting the reported reduction in the number of life insurance policies underwritten compared to the prior year and the increased competition mdg is facing in the uk market  which our management views as a mature market 
screenings represented of mdg s revenues in other our remaining hid revenues consist principally of the revenues derived by heritage labs and mid america agency services maas  our outsourced underwriting business in the us heritage labs revenues in were million  a decline of million or compared to heritage labs tested fewer specimens  vs 
 in compared to the prior year 
heritage s average revenue per specimen tested was higher in vs 

the reduced demand for heritage labs services is primarily attributable to the loss of a client as a result of that client being acquired by another insurance company  which is not a customer of heritage labs  along with volume reductions at a customer resulting from its decision to distribute their lab testing among several suppliers 
the increased average revenue per specimen is primarily the result of greater utilization of additional tests 
heritage labs laboratory currently operates at approximately of capacity 
we are exploring business opportunities  including opportunities in the wellness and disease management markets  to utilize the additional capacity of our laboratory 
heritage labs revenues in increased to million  an increase of from the level of million 
the increased revenues reflected increases in the number of specimens tested  in vs 
 in  as well as increases in the average revenue per specimen tested in and in 
maas s revenues in of million were down million or compared to the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to a reduction in the number of life insurance applications being underwritten by maas customers in maas has been notified by a major client that in order to mitigate the client s risk in utilizing maas as its sole outsourced underwriter  the client will expand its underwriter supplier network beginning in as a result of the reduction in revenue from this client  maas s annual revenues are expected to decline by approximately million 
we are aggressively pursuing additional revenue opportunities to replace this expected loss in volume  including the hiring of new sales people 
our revenues in from maas outsourced underwriting business increased to million  compared to million in the eight month period of ie from the time of our acquisition of maas in may 
the increase was due to a full year of revenues in and an increase in volume from maas s principal customer 
claims evaluation division our claims evaluation division ced operates under the name of hooper evaluations  inc following the merger into hooper evaluations  inc 
of the four companies ie  d d associates  medimax  allegiance health and michigan evaluation group we acquired between november and may the merger was effected in february our claims evaluation division s revenues for were million  down million or compared to the full year of the decline is primarily attributable to the following a reduction in peer reviews in new york state  which we believe reflects increased cost consciousness on the part of property and casualty insurance carriers  self insureds and third party administrators and the perception that such reviews have been of limited value in litigating claims  a decrease in the number of independent medical exams imes ordered by our customers when evaluating a claim  and a decrease in the number of claims referred to the division by its existing customer base 
the company has recently hired additional salespersons to expand our customer base  while offering several new products services 
ced experienced a decline in revenues in of million  compared to million in vs 
million in 
the decrease in was attributable to several factors  including the reported decline in automobile accident related claims activity in the new york market  which management believes reflected more conservative automobile insurance underwriting standards  the continuing effects of regulatory changes adopted in the mid s that  among other things  require claimants and medical practitioners to notify insurers of potential no fault auto claims on a more timely basis  which has  in turn  resulted in a decline in the number of claims that may be considered for an ime or peer review  and heightened enforcement of insurance fraud laws by the new york state attorney general  the new york state insurance bureau and the district attorney s office and special investigative units of insurance companies  which reduced the need for additional claims evaluation services 
cost of operations our total cost of operations amounted to million in  compared to million in and million in the following table shows the cost of operations as a percentage of revenues and  in the case of the hid  further broken down by certain of the component businesses during the last three years

the increase in the cost of operations as a percentage of the hid s revenues in was primarily attributable to a decline in revenues in our portamedic  medicals direct  heritage labs and maas businesses  without a corresponding adjustment to the applicable cost structures  higher fees paid to contract paramedical examiners  reflecting the company s efforts to retain and recruit qualified examiners  the lower average revenue per portamedic examination  and the higher proportion of segment revenues derived by our lower margin tele interviewing underwriting business relative to our higher margin portamedic paramedical exam business 
the increase in cost of operations was partially offset by lower material costs for heritage labs 
as noted previously in the overview section of management s discussion and analysis  the company completed a strategic review in september which resulted in detailed plans to implement expense management initiatives identified during the review 
many of these initiatives are targeted to reduce our cost of operations  such as our balancing of office volumes with operating costs  while eliminating geographic overlap among our offices 
additional expense management initiatives are discussed in the overview section 
the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenues for the health information division in compared to was due to the following the lower average revenue per portamedic examination  the higher proportion of segment revenues derived by our lower margin tele interviewing underwriting business relative to our higher margin portamedic paramedical exam business  an increase in portamedic and infolink branch operating expenses of approximately million despite a decrease in revenue  and higher fees paid to contract paramedical examiners  reflecting the company s efforts to retain and recruit qualified examiners 
claims evaluation division cost of operations for the ced totaled million in  compared to million in and million in as a percentage of revenues  cost of operations represented  and in  and  respectively 
the percentage increase in and was primarily attributable to lower revenue levels of our higher margin peer review revenue  and increased costs associated with administering claims to our expanding geographic customer base

health information division the hid s sg a represented  and of segment revenues in  and  respectively 
the sg a for the hid segment includes segment sg a plus sg a for all corporate overhead departments 
sg a expenses for the hid segment increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the same period last year 
the million increase in sg a in compared with the prior year was primarily due to increased it costs such as additional data networks  new software license and maintenance fees and increased depreciation expense in totaling approximately million  resulting from our new branch operating system and financial operating systems  additional expenses totaling million attributable to bank fees related to our previous credit facility and expenses associated with the completion of our strategic review  increased bad debt expense associated with the company s review of the collectability of certain portamedic accounts receivable of approximately million  and increased sg a at mdg  primarily due to the full year impact of doctors direct acquired in january  totaling million 
the increases listed above have been partially offset by reduced intangible asset amortization expense in of approximately million as a result of the company s impairment charge recorded in for intangible assets

impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of  the company s management initiated the testing for impairment of long lived assets and its annual goodwill impairment testing in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 respectively 
long lived assets under sfas no 
 long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  are to be tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present 
as discussed in the overview  there were several events and circumstances that constituted impairment indicators in the fourth quarter of accordingly  we initiated an impairment analysis of our long lived assets and determined that the carrying values of some of the long lived assets exceeded their projected undiscounted net cash flows 
with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we calculated the fair values of our long lived assets 
the fair values were determined based on discounted cash flows and indicated that an impairment of certain of our intangible assets existed 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of the company recorded an impairment charge totaling million 
the impairment charge consisted of an impairment of hid intangible assets eg  customer relationships  non competition agreements and trade names and is recorded within impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill under sfas no 
 the impairment test involves determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as would occur in a purchase transaction  treating the fair value of the reporting unit as the equivalent of the purchase price and deducting from that amount  the fair value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit 
as part of our annual impairment assessment under sfas no 
 the company considered all of the impairment indicators previously discussed  as well as the impairment recorded on its long lived assets 
with the assistance of the independent valuation firm  we determined the fair values of each of our reporting units utilizing both discounted cash flows and market based methodologies 
we have defined our reporting segments hid and ced as our reporting units for goodwill accounting 
the analysis indicated that the carrying amount of each reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  under sfas no 
 we were required to perform the second step of the impairment testing for both reporting units 
this entailed adjusting the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit to their fair market values as of december   for purposes of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of such goodwill 
the analysis indicated a goodwill impairment of million for hid and million for ced 
these amounts were recorded in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company s management performed its annual testing for impairment of goodwill  in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements 
we also deemed it appropriate to test for impairment of long lived assets  since certain impairment indicators were present 
during the course of the testing process  we considered a number of events and circumstances that constitute impairment indicators under the literature  including the company s operating loss in the third quarter of  a preliminary expectation of an operating loss in the fourth quarter of projections of operating results in future periods that reflected an assumption that some of the negative trends adversely affecting each of the company s two divisions discussed above would continue  and a decline in the market price of our common stock over a sustained period of time 
with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we determined that certain intangible assets as well as goodwill for both reporting units were impaired 
upon completion of the impairment tests  we recorded non cash impairment charges to certain intangible assets and goodwill of million million in ced and million in hid and million million in ced and million in hid  respectively restructuring and other charges for the year ended december   the company recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately million 
the charges are primarily attributable to restructuring charges for employee severance and branch office closures totaling million  a fee payable to outside consultants  including expenses  of million based on the results of the company s strategic review  a contract cancellation fee related to the early termination of a software resale agreement totaling million  legal and audit fees related to the company s restatement of its and financial statements of approximately million  and a litigation settlement charge of million pertaining to a lawsuit filed against the company alleging violations of california wage and hour laws 
the payment of this settlement is expected to occur in the third quarter of for the year ended december   the company recorded approximately million of restructuring and other charges pertaining to restructuring charges for employee severance and branch office closure costs of million  an aggregate of million in costs associated with the severance packages of our former chief executive officer  chief financial officer and other senior management members  and the cancellation of a software development project and contract cancellation fees approximating million 
in  the company recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately million for expenses associated with an audit committee investigation of our former chief executive officer 
operating income loss our consolidated operating loss for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
the decrease results from a lower impairment charge on goodwill and intangibles of million million vs 
million partially offset by unfavorable operating results and increased special charges 
our operating loss in of million reflected a decrease of million from the operating income of million 
the decrease in operating income resulted from the goodwill and impairment charge of million  unfavorable operating results  as well as increased restructuring and other charges 
as a percentage of revenues  the consolidated operating loss for the year ended december  was compared to a consolidated operating loss of for the year ended december  and an operating profit of in health information division 
as a result of the factors discussed above  the hid segment recorded an operating loss of million for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of million in and a million operating profit in as a percentage of revenues  the operating income loss was for the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  and in claims evaluation division 
operating income in was million compared to million in and million in as a percentage of revenues  the ced s operating income was in  in and in income taxes income taxes recorded for the year ended december   totaled million  and primarily results from the million non cash charge to record a full valuation allowance for the company s deferred tax assets  partially offset by a million tax benefit resulting from the company s ability to carryback a portion of the federal net operating loss to the company has significant deferred tax assets attributable to tax deductible intangibles  capital loss carryforwards  and federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  which may reduce taxable income in future periods 
during the third quarter of the company concluded that based on the decline in revenues and margin  the cumulative tax and operating losses  the lack of taxes in the carryback period  and the uncertainty surrounding the extent or timing of future taxable income  it was no longer more likely than not that it would realize the tax benefits of its deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net us deferred tax assets in the third quarter of in addition  the company recorded a valuation allowance on the additional us deferred tax assets created during the fourth quarter of the effective tax rate benefit for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
net income loss net loss for the year ended december  was million or per share compared to a net loss of million or per share in the same period of the prior year

the complaint alleged that the company failed to pay overtime wages  provide meal and rest periods and reimbursement for expenses incurred by examiners in performing examinations 
we currently employ approximately examiners in california and have employed in excess of  examiners in california over the past months 
following a mediation on december   the parties reached a settlement  pursuant to which the company will pay the sum of million to the class members in full settlement of this lawsuit 
in the past  some state agencies have claimed that we improperly classified our examiners as independent contractors for purposes of state unemployment tax laws and that we were therefore liable for taxes in arrears  or for penalties for failure to comply with such state agencies interpretations of the laws 
we received an adverse determination in the state of california  and as a result  converted our examiners located in the state of california to employees 
there are no assurances that we will not be subject to similar claims in other states in the future 
on july   the company received a determination from the internal revenue service that one individual the company contracted with as an independent contractor should have been classified as an employee in this ruling also applies to any other individuals engaged by the company under similar circumstances 
the ruling states that the company may not be subject to adverse consequences  as the company may be entitled to relief under applicable tax laws section of the revenue act of 
management believes that the company qualifies for relief under section to date  the company has not received any further communication from the internal revenue service and considers the matter closed 
the company is a party to a number of legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business

inflation inflation has not had  nor is it expected to have  a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of a company s operating results and or financial condition and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these determinations upon the best information available to us during the period in which we are accounting for our results 
our estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change or as further information becomes available 
further  these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
changes in our estimates are recorded in the period the change occurs 
we have identified the accounting policies discussed below as critical to us 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for paramedical and medical examinations when the examination of the insurance policy applicant is completed 
revenues generated from medical record collection  laboratory testing  independent medical exam  peer review or similar services and other services are recognized when the related service is completed 
in all cases  there must be evidence of an agreement with the customer  the sales price must be fixed or determinable  delivery of services must occur and collectibility must be reasonably assured 
revenue in our medicals direct group for certain services performed for the legal profession is recognized upon the successful outcome of the case 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for i estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  and ii amounts that customers may deduct from their remittances to the company for billed items not in compliance with customer specifications 
management continuously assesses the financial condition of our customers  the markets in which these customers participate as well as historical trends relating to customer deductions and adjusts the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this periodic review 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  our ability to collect on accounts could be negatively impacted  in which case additional allowances may be required 
we must make significant management judgments and estimates in determining allowances for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
one significant uncertainty inherent in our analysis is whether our past experience will be indicative of future periods 
adverse changes in general economic conditions could affect our allowance estimates  collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets and assets to be disposed long lived assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the following are examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the long lived asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the process to identify if there is an impairment includes the following steps a comparison of the undiscounted net cash flows from the business group to the carrying value of the long lived assets  and if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows  an impairment is identified 
the amount of the impairment is based on the excess of the carrying value of the long lived assets to its fair value 
we estimate the fair value of the long lived assets with the assistance of a third party appraiser 
as discussed in the overview  there were several events and circumstances that constituted impairment indicators in the fourth quarter of accordingly  we initiated an impairment analysis of our long lived assets and determined that the carrying values of some of the long lived assets exceeded their projected undiscounted net cash flows 
with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we calculated the fair values of our long lived assets 
the fair values were determined based on discounted cash flows and indicated that an impairment of certain of our intangible assets existed 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of the company recorded an impairment charge totaling million 
the impairment charge consisted of an impairment of hid intangible assets eg  customer relationships  non competition agreements and trade names and is recorded within impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the consolidated statement of operations 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
goodwill impairment we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value to its fair value 
we have defined our two segments hid and ced as our sfas no 
reporting units 
an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process of determining impairment 
in step one  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value and if the carrying value exceeds the fair value there is an impairment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units with the assistance of a third party appraiser  which includes a combination of discounted cash flows and market multiples 
the second step identifies the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined as though the reporting unit was involved in a business acquisition 
ie the existing assets and liabilities are adjusted to fair market value and a valuation is placed on any unrecorded intangibles 
the fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit and the difference is implied goodwill 
as part of our annual impairment assessment under sfas no 
 the company considered all of the impairment indicators previously discussed  as well as the impairment recorded on its long lived assets 
with the assistance of the independent valuation firm  we determined the fair values of each of our reporting units utilizing both discounted cash flows and market based methodologies 
we have defined our reporting segments hid and ced as our reporting units for goodwill accounting 
the analysis indicated that the carrying amount of each reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  under sfas no 
 we were required to perform the second step of the impairment testing for both reporting units 
this entailed adjusting the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit to their fair market values as of december   for purposes of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of such goodwill 
the analysis indicated a goodwill impairment of million for hid and million for ced 
these amounts were recorded in the fourth quarter of accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
during the third quarter of the company concluded that based on the decline in revenues and margin  the cumulative tax and operating losses  the lack of taxes in the carryback period  and the uncertainty surrounding the extent or timing of future taxable income  it was no longer more likely than not that it would realize the tax benefits of its deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net us deferred tax assets in the third quarter of in addition  the company recorded a valuation allowance on the additional us deferred tax assets created during the fourth quarter of based on this assessment  during the year ended december   we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets totaling million 
we intend to reinvest the unremitted earnings of our uk subsidiary 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us or additional us taxes with respect to these earnings 
in the event of repatriation to the us  such earnings would be subject to us income taxes 
foreign tax credits would be available to reduce the amount of us tax otherwise payable in future years 
share based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and requires companies to recognize compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payments  such as stock options granted to employees 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
compensation cost for stock options is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant 
sfas no 
r also requires that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share based awards 
we monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
we estimate the fair values with the assistance of a third party valuation company 
the estimated fair values are based on assumptions  including estimated lives  volatility  dividend yield  and risk free interest rates 
these estimates also consider the probability that the options will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder  which are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin is intended to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on the related de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods  disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently assessing the expected effect of adopting fin  and we do not presently expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement 
sfas applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards except for measurements of share based payments and is intended to increase the consistency of those measurements 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of sfas will change current practice 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are still in the process of reviewing the impact  however  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statement sab 
sab clarifies the staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
the sec staff believes registrants must quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab allows registrants to adjust prior year financial statements for errors in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of this fiscal year that were immaterial under a company s previous method for evaluating errors but material under the method prescribed by sab  with an offsetting adjustment being made to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we adopted sab during the fourth quarter of  effective january   however it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as of january  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s credit facility is based on variable rates and is therefore subject to interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  our interest expense will vary as a result of interest rate changes and the level of any outstanding borrowings 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding 
we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to the british pound 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates by measuring the potential impact on earnings  fair values and cash flows 
while our uk subsidiary s results of operations and financial condition are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we do not consider the related risk to be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
if the exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar were to decrease  the effect on net income would have been negligible 
based on the company s market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december   the company has determined that there was no material market risk exposure to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such date
