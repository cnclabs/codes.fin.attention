overview since its inception in september  neurogen has been engaged in the discovery and development of drugs 
the company has not derived any revenue or earnings from product sales and has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  significant losses in most years prior to deriving any such product revenues or earnings 
revenues to date have come from six collaborative research agreements  one license agreement and one technology transfer agreement 
in november  neurogen acquired worldwide rights to aplindore  a small molecule partial agonist for the d dopamine receptor  from wyeth pharmaceuticals  a division of wyeth wyeth 
along with the initial million license fee paid upon signing  neurogen will pay wyeth for the shipment of compound material suitable for phase trials  milestone payments upon the successful achievement of clinical development and regulatory events  and royalties on worldwide sales 
neurogen expects to commence phase trials in parkinson s disease and restless legs syndrome rls with aplindore in late the compound was initially developed by wyeth for use in schizophrenia  and wyeth had studied the compound in six phase clinical trials involving over healthy volunteers and over schizophrenic patients 
during  the company incurred significant expenses in conducting clinical trials and other development activities  such as formulation testing and toxicology studies for ng  the company s lead compound for insomnia and ngd  the company s lead compound in its obesity program 
ng  currently in phase testing  is the company s most advanced drug candidate 
if ng continues to progress in further phase and phase studies without the company partnering the program  clinical trial and other development expenses related to ng will continue to increase 
development costs for the insomnia program  as well as costs for the company s other unpartnered programs  may continue to increase 
the actual amount of these development expenses will derive from the level of development activities being conducted  and the level of these activities is contingent on the results of ongoing studies 
research and development expenses accounted for between and of total expenses over the last three years 
in december  neurogen and merck sharp dohme limited merck entered into a collaboration agreement the merck agreement to discover and develop next generation drugs targeting the vanilloid receptor vr for the treatment of pain 
as of december   neurogen had received million for the purchase of  shares of newly issued neurogen common stock at the initiation of the agreement  million in total license fees  million in research funding  and million in milestones from merck 
on september   neurogen and merck agreed to amend the research collaboration and license agreement to extend the initial three year research program component of their vr collaboration for one year until december  under the amended collaboration agreement  merck is scheduled to pay neurogen million  of which million was received prior to year end  for work performed during such one year extension  provided that merck has the option to end the research program component of the collaboration and the remainder of any associated funding by providing days advance written notice to neurogen 
merck has not exercised the right to terminate as of the date of this filing 
merck retains the option to extend the discovery and research effort for up to an additional year beyond december  collaborative agreements have been and are expected to continue to be a source of funding for the company 
such arrangements not only drive current revenue through the recognition of upfront and subsequent license fees  research funding and potential milestone payments  but over the longer term these arrangements may have a significant impact on potential future product revenue and earnings in the form of royalties if the agreements result in successful drug development and commercialization 
the initiation  expiration and specific terms of such agreements have contributed to  and will continue to cause  significant fluctuations in the company s recognized revenues and losses 
the company will continue to seek early stage partnerships for some research and development programs  while it selectively retains the rights to other drug programs to more advanced stages before considering partnership arrangements 
the decision of whether and when to partner a program is based on an analysis of development risk  resources required to complete each regulatory stage  and the amount of immediate versus long term return that could be extracted at each stage of development 
in the second quarter of  the company was informed that the connecticut department of environmental protection the dep is considering taking action against the company as a result of incidents where the company s wastewater monitoring systems indicated that the wastewater ph limits of the company s wastewater discharge permit had been exceeded 
however  no formal communication has been received from the dep as of the date of this filing 
the actions the dep could take include  but are not limited to  fines  penalties  remedial action and future additional monitoring activities 
at this time  the company does not have enough information to enable it to estimate the cost  if any  of the dep s actions and  accordingly  no amounts have been recorded in the accompanying financial statements for this matter 
the company is not aware of any negative environmental impacts resulting from these incidents but continues to carefully monitor its wastewater neutralization systems in an effort to prevent any further incidents and maintain compliance with its permit conditions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of neurogen s financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions and exercise judgment  which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management makes estimates and exercises judgment in the valuation of marketable securities and investments  evaluation of investments and other assets for other than temporary impairment  accruals  revenue recognition  collaboration costs  income taxes and stock compensation 
actual amounts and outcomes could differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of neurogen s financial statements revenue recognition periodically  neurogen enters into collaborative research agreements that  among other things  generally provide for the funding to neurogen of specified projects and the granting to neurogen s partners of certain development and commercialization rights related to potential discoveries 
revenue under these arrangements typically includes upfront non refundable fees  ongoing payments for specified levels of staffing for research  milestone payments upon occurrence of certain events and royalties on product sales  if ever 
revenue recognized from collaborative agreements is based upon the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
non refundable upfront license fees are recognized as revenue when there is a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and there are no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf the upfront license payment would be recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the license only if the license had standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either not have standalone value or have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations is not determinable  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the upfront license payments would be recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
when it is determined that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  the company determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the performance obligations are expected to be completed 
in addition  if the company is involved in a steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  an assessment is made as to whether the involvement constituted a performance obligation or a right to participate 
collaborations may also contain substantive milestone payments 
milestone payments are considered to be performance payments that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if the milestone event is deemed to be substantive after considering all of the following conditions the milestone payment is non refundable  the achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone and a reasonable amount of time passes between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment the substantive milestone method 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of the substantive milestone conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone and  therefore  the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed 
royalty revenue will be recognized upon the sale of related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed and determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the collaborative agreement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  the royalty payment would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and  therefore  would be recognized as such performance obligations are performed 
in the financial statements  license fees revenue includes up front  anniversary license payments and non refundable fees under collaborative research agreements 
research revenue includes research funding for the company s staffing on projects and milestone payments under collaborative agreements 
deferred revenue arises from the payments received for research and development to be conducted in future periods or for licenses of neurogen s rights or technology where neurogen has continuing obligations 
research and development costs all research and development costs  which primarily include scientific salaries and benefits  laboratory supplies  external research studies  compound formulation and manufacturing and overhead facilities expenses  are expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective application transition method mpa and began recognizing compensation expense for the estimated fair value of all share based payment awards 
under mpa  the company valued and expensed new awards granted after december   based on their grant date fair values and vesting schedules 
awards that were granted prior to december  but that vested after december  were expensed utilizing the pro forma expense previously calculated under sfas no 
as of december   no liability awards have been granted 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company accounted for grants of stock options and restricted stock utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  accordingly  recognized no employee compensation expense for the options when the option grants had an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant 
the company reported the disclosures as required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the company primarily grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant and is expensed over the service period of the award  which in most cases equals the vesting period 
the company has selected the black scholes method to estimate the fair value of options 
the company has also issued restricted stock to key executives  which has been and will continue to be recorded as expense over the vesting period based upon the market price of the stock at date of grant 
the company occasionally grants stock option awards to consultants 
as required by sfas no 
r  such grants continue to be accounted for pursuant to eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
compensation expense is based upon the fair value of such awards over the performance period using the black scholes method 
management also evaluated the assumptions that underlie the valuation of share based payment awards 
following is a summary of some of the principal assumptions and classifications the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding 
in predicting the life of option grants  all stock options meet the definition of plain vanilla options under sab no 
with the exception of option grants to the board of directors  and therefore  the simplified method was used to calculate the term for grants other than the board of directors 
the expected term for board of directors grants was calculated based upon historical analysis 
the expected term used during was not significantly different from the expected term used when following the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
forfeitures of options are estimated based upon historical data and are adjusted based upon actual occurrences 
the cumulative effect of restricted stock forfeitures was immaterial 
in predicting expected volatility  assumptions were based solely upon historical volatilities of the company s stock  over a period equal to the expected term of the related equity instruments 
the company relies only on historical volatility since future volatility is expected to be consistent with historical 
under sfas no 
r  the company has separated optionees into two groupings based upon historical analysis of the exercise behavior of those groupings first  management and the board of directors  and  second  non management employees 
however  given the company s current use of the simplified method  the establishment of these groupings is not expected to have a significant impact on the calculation of expense 
the risk free rate utilized when valuing share based payment arrangements is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option being valued 
management s selection of the valuation components such as the black scholes pricing method  interest rate and volatility are consistent with the approach utilized when reporting pursuant to the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
marketable securities marketable securities at each of december  and december  consisted of us treasury obligations  direct obligations of us government agencies  investment grade asset backed securities and corporate debt securities 
at december   maturities ranged from approximately one month to approximately years while at december   they ranged from approximately one month to approximately years 
the company has classified all marketable securities as current under accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  paragraph  restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins 
such guidance indicates that a current classification is appropriate for resources such as marketable securities representing the investment of cash available for current operations 
the fair value of these securities is subject to volatility and change 
the company considers its investment portfolio to be available for sale securities as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses have been determined by the specific identification method and are included in investment income 
classifications of the company s marketable securities as other than available for sale pursuant to sfas no 
would possibly result in material impacts to the valuation of the securities and investment income 
neurogen periodically reviews its marketable securities portfolio for potential other than temporary impairment and recoverability 
gross unrealized losses for all investments in an unrealized loss position on the company s investments totaled million on aggregate fair value of million as of december  the company believes that the decline in market values of these investments resulted primarily from rising interest rates and not credit quality 
based on the contractual terms and credit quality of these securities  and current market conditions  the company does not consider it probable that any of them will be settled by the issuer at a price less than the amortized cost of the investments 
since the company believes it has the ability and intends to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be at maturity  and because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  the company does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  income taxes the liability method of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  is used to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on net operating loss carryforwards  research and development credit carryforwards  and differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
any subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be recorded as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations or a credit to additional paid in capital 
the issuance of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  is currently being evaluated by the company 
this new pronouncement and its potential impact are discussed in the section titled recently issued accounting pronouncements 
long lived assets in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement provides that a an impairment loss should only be recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  and b the measurement of impairment loss should be based on the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
it also provides that a long lived asset or asset group should be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment has occurred 
in addition  it provides for the use of probability weighted cash flow estimates in the recoverability test 
the company performs an annual review for possible impairment indicators and  if any are noted  would then perform a more substantive review for potential impairment of the relevant long lived asset or asset group 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the timing of income earned under existing or future collaborative research agreements  the progress of the company s independent and partnered research and development projects  the size of the company s staff and the level of preclinical and clinical development spending on drug candidates in unpartnered programs 
neurogen believes its research and development costs may increase significantly over the next several years as its drug development programs progress 
in addition  general and administrative expenses would be expected to increase to support any expanded research and development activities 
years ended december  and operating revenues for were million compared to million in  all of which relate to our collaborative agreement with merck 
the million increase in was primarily due to two clinical milestones received from merck in million received in february of which million was recognized as a substantive milestone in and million in october of which million was recognized as revenue in and an increase in license fee revenue of million due to the recognition of additional revenue related to the second anniversary license fee payment of million received in december these increases were offset by the scheduled decrease in the quarterly research funding level per the merck agreement see research collaborations section below of million 
research and development expenses for were million compared to million in  which was a million or increase 
clinical trials and development expenses increased in several of the company s unpartnered programs 
in the company s insomnia program  outsourced clinical expenses increased in by million from million to million for phase and phase trials 
in addition  outsourced clinical expenses in the company s obesity program increased by million in for a phase clinical trial on the company s lead compound  ngd outsourced development expenses such as toxicology studies  chemical manufacturing and formulations for the company s insomnia  obesity  and depression anxiety programs increased by million to million in compared to development spending of million in in  research and development expenses include a million license fee payment to wyeth ayerst in the fourth quarter for the in licensing of aplindore  a drug candidate for the treatment of parkinson s disease and restless legs syndrome 
salary and benefits expense increased by million to million  which included a million increase in non cash stock compensation expense associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r as well as an increase of approximately million to support the company s clinical development efforts 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in computer and research supplies expense 
the company expenses all research and development costs as incurred 
while the company maintains a system to record the level of staff time spent on each of its research and development projects  it does not maintain a historical cost accounting system with sufficient accuracy to reliably estimate its research and development costs on a specific project by project basis 
a significant portion of the company s research and development expenses such as laboratory supplies  travel  information systems and services and facilities costs benefit multiple projects and are not individually tracked to a specific project 
further  the company s staff timekeeping system does not account for differences in compensation costs between lower level technicians and more senior scientists 
in  general and administrative expenses increased by to million as compared to million in the million increase was due primarily to increases in patent expenses of million  facilities expenses of million  and salary and benefits expense of million  which included a million increase in non cash stock compensation expense associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
these increases were offset by a decrease in legal and other administrative expenses of million 
other income was million in compared to million in the million decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in interest income and the amortization of premiums and discounts on investments resulting from a lower average balance of marketable securities in compared to the company recognized connecticut income tax benefits of million and million in and  respectively 
the and benefits were the result of connecticut legislation which allows the company to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut for a portion of research and development tax credits in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of these credits into future tax years 
prior to  the company recorded the sale of the credits for the prior year at the time of filing the previous year s tax return  typically in september of the following year 
in  the company determined that it is more likely than not that it will continue to sell the credits to the state for cash 
therefore  as a result of this change in estimate  the company recorded the sale of credits generated for in the year ended december  as well as the sale of credits generated for see note for additional information 
years ended december  and operating revenues for were million compared to million in the million decrease in was primarily due to the termination of the company s research collaboration with aventis in september discussed below and the recognition in april of million from the achievement of a preclinical milestone in the merck agreement 
total revenue from the aventis collaboration in was million  which included million in license fees of which million was from the acceleration of all remaining previously deferred license revenue upon the termination and million in research funding 
license fees from the merck agreement were million in as compared to million in  primarily due to million recognized in from the license payment of million received in december  revenue from which is being recognized ratably over four years from initial recognition through the duration of the research program 
research revenue from the merck agreement decreased to million in from million in research and development expenses for were million compared to million in  which was a million or increase 
spending on clinical trials and development costs increased for several of the company s programs 
outsourced expenses of million were incurred for three phase clinical trials and the commencement of the phase clinical trial for ng for insomnia in  compared to expenses of million in for the completion of the company s exploratory phase a clinical trials for both asthma and rheumatoid arthritis indications in the ca program 
outsourced development expenses for toxicology studies  chemical manufacturing and formulations related to the insomnia  obesity  and depression anxiety programs increased by million to million in compared to development spending of million in  of which million and million of the development expenses in and  respectively  were for insomnia program costs 
staff salary and benefit expense to support the company s development efforts increased by million to million  which included an average headcount increase of in utility costs increased million to million in in  general and administrative expenses increased by to million as compared to million in the million increase was due primarily to increases in salary and benefits expense of million and in recruiting expenses of million in other income was million in compared to million in the million increase in was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from a higher average level of marketable securities in  offset by a slight increase in interest expense and a decline in realized gains on the sale or maturity of investments 
the company recognized connecticut income tax benefits of million and million in and  respectively  a portion of which in related to employee stock options and was recorded to additional paid in capital 
the and benefits were the result of connecticut legislation which allows the company to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut for a portion of research and development tax credits in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of these credits into future tax years 
see note for further discussion 
liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities at december  and december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in the aggregate were million and million  respectively 
a total amount of million of the marketable securities at december   had maturities beyond one year 
however  the company can and may liquidate such investments prior to maturity to meet its operating  strategic and or investment objectives 
the company s combined cash and other short term investments decreased in due to funding of operating expenses and payments on outstanding loans described below  partially offset by the receipt of net proceeds of million from an offering of common stock in december the levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to do so in the future as a result of operating needs and financing events 
the company intends to use its cash to pursue the further development of compounds in human clinical trials  the capabilities of its drug discovery platform and to enhance its capacity to pursue new drug targets  as well as fund general and corporate overhead 
neurogen believes this may allow it to retain a greater portion of commercial rights  potentially establish more valuable partnerships  and retain greater control over the drug development process 
debt arrangements the debt agreements entered into by the company to date include a commercial term mortgage loan financing in december with webster bank and a construction loan entered into in october with connecticut innovations  inc cii 
total proceeds received under these agreements were million  which are repayable through monthly installments over a maximum term of years 
the interest rate on the cii facility is fixed at an annual rate of  and the interest rate on the webster facility  tied to the one month libor rate  averaged and in and  respectively 
of these amounts borrowed  million and million remained outstanding as of december  under the webster bank facility and the cii facility  respectively 
an approximate aggregate amount of million in principal payments is due and payable in each of the next five years as well as a balloon payment of million on the mortgage loan with webster bank upon maturity in december thereafter  the remaining aggregate balance of approximately million is payable in regular monthly installments to cii until the scheduled maturity date 
as of december   neurogen does not have any significant lease or capital expenditure commitments 
under the terms of the amended webster bank facility agreement  the company is required to comply with certain covenants  including a requirement that the company maintain at least million in cash and or marketable securities 
a separate loan to value covenant required that the ratio of the outstanding loan balance less any cash collateral to the appraised value of the real property not exceed 
in january  the company was notified by webster bank that an appraisal received by the bank suggested that the value of the property had declined 
in march  the company paid down the balance of the principal by million over previously scheduled payments  in exchange for amending the loan agreement to remove the loan to value covenant 
following notification from webster bank of the lower appraised value of its property  the company reviewed the carrying value of its buildings and improvements for possible impairment and recoverability pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
based on the company s estimated future cash flows for the remaining useful lives of the building and improvements  the company concluded that the carrying value of the assets was recoverable as defined by sfas therefore  the company determined that it was unnecessary to record an impairment loss or adjust the carrying value of the company s buildings and improvements 
evaluation of investments for other than temporary impairment in accordance with fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
and sfas no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  the company reviewed its marketable securities portfolio  which consists of us treasury obligations  direct obligations of us government agencies  investment grade asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations  for potential other than temporary impairment 
gross unrealized losses related to the company s investments totaled million an aggregate fair value of million for all investments in unrealized loss positions as of december  all marketable securities held at december  have been in a continuous loss position for twelve months or more and the related unrealized loss was million 
the company believes that the decline in market values of these investments resulted primarily from rising interest rates and not credit quality 
the company believes it has the ability and intends to hold investments that mature in the next twelve months until maturity and thereby recover the fair market value 
unrealized losses related to securities that mature beyond the next twelve months  and that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more  amounted to million  or  of the total market value of such marketable securities as of december  the company has not recorded any losses for other than temporary impairment at this time  however  if interest rates rise and such unrealized losses become more significant  the company may record impairment losses 
in evaluating the unrealized losses  the company considered the nature of the investments  current credit ratings  maturity dates and the company s projected cash requirements 
financing activities neurogen s cash requirements to date have been met by the proceeds of its equity financing activities  amounts received pursuant to collaborative research  licensing or technology transfer arrangements  certain debt arrangements and interest earned on invested funds 
the company s equity financing activities have included underwritten public offerings of common stock  private placement offerings of common stock and private sales of common stock in connection with collaborative research and licensing agreements 
the company s expenditures have funded research and development  general and administrative expenses  and the construction and outfitting of its research and development facilities 
the company may from time to time  as warranted by its operating and strategic requirements  augment its cash balance through financing transactions  including the issuance of debt or equity securities and further corporate alliances 
the company filed an s registration statement that became effective in february  under which the company may issue debt  common or preferred stock or warrants of up to million in total financing 
to date  the company has issued approximately million in common stock pursuant to this s registration statement 
in january  the company received million from merck for the purchase of  shares 
in december  the company received approximately million before transaction costs in a public offering of  shares 
no assurances can be given that adequate levels of additional funding can be obtained on favorable terms if at all 
in may  the company filed with the sec a registration statement on form s to enable the resale of  shares of newly issued shares of neurogen common stock acquired in a private placement transaction by warburg pincus private equity viii  lp  entities affiliated with baker brothers investments and entities affiliated with the tisch family 
the registration statement became effective in november the company is in the early stage of product development 
the company has not derived any product revenues from product sales and does not expect to derive any product revenues for at least the next several years if at all 
prior to deriving any such product revenues  the company expects to incur significant losses and negative cash flows that in the aggregate could exceed the company s existing cash resources 
to provide cash to fund its operations until such time as it achieves sustainable revenues  the company relies extensively on its ability to develop drug discovery programs of sufficient value to either partner the programs with pharmaceutical companies or raise capital through equity or debt financings 
to the extent that drug candidates progress in the company s currently unpartnered programs  such as its proprietary insomnia program  its program to treat obesity  its program for the treatment of depression and anxiety  or earlier stage programs  such progress could lead to the opportunity to partner on terms which provide capital  revenues and cash flows to the company or the opportunity to raise capital through equity or debt offerings 
if unpartnered programs do not progress or do not progress on schedule  such opportunities would be delayed or may not materialize at all 
to the extent that drug candidates progress in the company s vr program partnered with merck  such progress could result in milestone payments and additional research and development funding to the company under the merck agreements 
such progress could also provide the opportunity to raise capital through equity offerings 
if the vr program does not progress or does not progress on schedule  such opportunities would be delayed or may not materialize at all 
the company does not have control over the progress of the vr program 
lack of progress  scheduling delays or failures in any of the company s major programs could significantly reduce the company s levels of revenues  cash flows and cash available to fund its business 
these factors could also significantly increase the company s cost of capital and limit its ability to raise equity or debt 
all of the company s compounds in development  whether in human clinical trials or not  will require significant additional research  development and testing before they can be commercialized 
furthermore  the scope  magnitude and timing of future research and development expenses  as well as anticipated project completion dates  are a series of steps  ranging from preclinical testing to clinical studies in humans 
each step in the process is typically more expensive than the previous step  but actual timing and cost for completion depends on the specific progress of each product being tested 
while the company cannot accurately predict the time required or the cost involved in commercializing any one of its candidates  new drug development typically takes many years and tens or hundreds of millions of dollars 
in addition  developing new drugs is an extremely uncertain process where most candidates fail and uncertain developments such as clinical or regulatory delays  side effects  undesirable drug properties or ineffectiveness of a drug candidate would slow or prevent the development of a product 
if neurogen or its partners are unable to commercialize one or more of our drug products  the company may never achieve product revenues and may eventually be unable to continue operations 
this result would cause its stockholders to lose all or a substantial portion of their investment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
increasing interest rates have led to a decline in market values of fixed rate investments held as of december  the company considers such impairment as temporary because of its ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be at maturity 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates fair value of investments with expected maturities in the following years in thousands total fixed rate investments weighted average interest capital market risk 
the company currently has no product revenues and is dependent on funds raised through other sources 
one source of funding is through collaborative partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies  which sometimes include an equity purchase by neurogen s partner 
another source of funding is further equity offerings to financial investors 
the ability of the company to raise funds in both of these cases  and the desirability of raising such funds  is dependent upon capital markets forces affecting the price of the company s stock 
these market forces  which fluctuate widely and frequently in the biotechnology capital markets  include both general market conditions and specific conditions  such as the stock performance of peer companies  rotation of funds from various market sectors  including sectors defined by market capitalization  stage of development or therapeutic focus and the activities of large holders of individual stocks 
because a significant majority of neurogen s stock is held by only a few institutions and the average trading volume of the stock is relatively low  changes in general or specific market conditions can significantly impact the stock price of the company
