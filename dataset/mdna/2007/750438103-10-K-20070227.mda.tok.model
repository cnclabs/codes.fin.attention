overview radioshack is primarily a specialty retailer of consumer electronics products and services 
we seek to differentiate ourselves from our various competitors by providing cost effective solutions to meet the routine electronics needs and distinct electronics wants of our customers 
this strategy allows us to take advantage of the unique opportunities provided by our extensive retail presence  knowledgeable sales staff  and relationships with reputable vendors 
overall  our day to day focus is concentrated in four major areas provide our customers a positive in store experience grow gross profit dollars by increasing the overall value of each ticket reduce costs continually throughout the organization allocate the dollars generated from operations appropriately  investing only in projects that have an adequate return or are operationally necessary turnaround program review due to negative trends that developed in our business during calendar year  we announced a turnaround program on february   that contained four key components update our inventory focus on our top performing radioshack company operated stores  while closing to radioshack company operated stores  and aggressively relocate other radioshack company operated stores consolidate our distribution centers reduce our overhead costs through december   we conducted a liquidation of certain inventory during the summer and fall of and replaced underperforming merchandise with new faster moving merchandise 
during the summer of  we also focused on our top performing stores and completed the closure of underperforming stores  reducing the number of retail employees in connection with these closures 
additionally  we consolidated our distribution centers in the fall of management has also reduced our cost structure  including our advertising spend rate and our workforce within our corporate headquarters 
a number of other cost reductions have also been implemented 
as of december   we considered our turnaround program to be substantially complete 
see financial impact of turnaround program below for a discussion of the financial impact of our turnaround program 
key indicators of financial performance for management we use several key financial performance metrics  including metrics related to net sales and operating revenues  gross profit and gross margin  and operating income 
net sales and operating revenues metrics as a retailer  we consider profitable growth in revenue to be one of the key indicators of our overall financial performance 
we examine our revenue by using several key metrics  including overall change in net sales and operating revenues and in comparable store sales performance  as well as the related gross profit derived from these sales 
the change in net sales and operating revenue  coupled with the review of gross profit dollars  provides us with an overall indication of the demand for our products and services 
comparable store sales include the sales of any domestic retail location where we have a physical presence  including radioshack company operated stores and kiosks  that has more than full months of recorded sales 
the table below summarizes these revenue metrics for the periods indicated year ended december  consolidated net sales and operating revenues decline growth comparable store sales decrease increase consolidated net sales and operating revenues as well as comparable store sales declined in  due in part to a sales decrease within our radioshack company operated stores segment s wireless and modern home platforms 
additionally  these decreases were partially attributable to a change in the manner in which we recognize income associated with sales of prepaid wireless airtime 
beginning in  principally as a result of changes in our agreements with wireless carriers  we no longer record the full value of airtime purchased by customers  but rather record only our markup on the sale as revenue 
this change reduced our revenue by approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding prior year period 
this change had no impact on our gross profit or operating income 
consolidated net sales and operating revenues were also impacted by the company operated stores closed in connection with our turnaround plan 
gross profit and gross margin metrics we view gross profit dollars and gross margin as key metrics of our financial performance  as they indicate the extent to which we are able to manage our product costs and sales volume 
the table below summarizes gross profit and gross margin for the periods indicated year ended december  gross profit gross margin operating income metrics operating income from our two reportable segments  as well as the other and unallocated categories  is as follows year ended december  in millions radioshack company operated stores kiosks other unallocated operating income included in the radioshack company operated stores segment is a charge of million for property  plant and equipment impairment for the year ended december  included in the kiosks segment are impairment charges of million to goodwill  million to an intangible asset  and million to property  plant and equipment for the year ended december the decline in the other category for the year ended december   was primarily driven by a decline in our service centers operating income 
additionally  this category includes charges of million and million for impairment of property  plant and equipment and for goodwill  respectively  for the year ended december   which contributed to the decline 
included in the unallocated category are overhead and corporate expenses that are not allocated to the separate reportable segments for management reporting purposes 
unallocated costs include corporate departmental expenses such as payroll and benefits  as well as advertising  insurance  distribution and information technology costs

average store size sq 
ft 
at december  radioshack company operated stores kiosks dealer and other outlets n a total number of retail locations in we closed radioshack company operated stores  net of new store openings and relocations 
this decline resulted primarily from the implementation of our turnaround program  which included the closure of company operated stores  as well as our decision not to renew leases on other locations that failed to meet our financial return goals 
see turnaround program overview included in md a below 
in  we closed a total of radioshack company operated stores  net of new store openings and relocations  due to our decision not to renew leases on locations that failed to meet our financial return goals 
as of december   sam s club had the unconditional right to assume the operation of up to additional kiosk locations 
they assumed operation of kiosk locations during the first quarter of and in the fourth quarter of that were previously operated by us 
dealer and other outlets included company operated stores and dealer outlets in canada at december  in and  we closed dealer outlets  net of new outlet openings or conversions to radioshack company operated stores 
this decline was primarily due to the closure of smaller outlets that did not meet our financial return goals 
results of operations net sales and operating revenues sales decreased to  million in from  million in we also had a decrease in comparable store sales 
these changes were primarily the result of a decrease in our service platform sales due primarily to the manner in which we began recognizing sales of prepaid wireless airtime in and a decrease in our wireless platform sales 
in addition  all platforms were affected by the decline in the number of radioshack company operated stores as a result of our turnaround program 
consolidated net sales and operating revenues for our two reportable segments and service centers and other sales are as follows year ended december  in millions radioshack company operated stores kiosks other sales consolidated net sales and operating revenues the following table provides a summary of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues by platform and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
these consolidated platform sales include sales from our radioshack company operated stores and kiosks  as well as other sales 
consolidated net sales and operating revenues year ended december  in millions wireless accessory personal electronics modern home power technical service service centers and other sales consolidated net sales and operating revenues service centers and other sales include outside sales from our service centers  in addition to radioshack company operated store repair revenue and outside sales of our global sourcing operations and domestic and overseas manufacturing facilities 
compared with radioshack company operated stores net sales and operating revenues year ended december  in millions wireless accessory personal electronics modern home power technical service other revenue net sales and operating revenues all sales in the platforms shown above were impacted by the closure of the radioshack company operated stores related to our turnaround program 
sales in our wireless platform includes wireless handsets and communication devices such as scanners  gps units and two way radios decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these decreases were primarily driven by a decline in unit sales of wireless handsets 
factors contributing to this sales decline included an unfavorable mix shift to prepaid handsets from postpaid  a sluggish wireless industry environment  a sharp unit sales decline in the northeastern united states  and fewer radioshack stores 
these decreases were partially offset by the introduction of various gps products 
sales in our accessory platform includes accessories for home entertainment products  wireless handsets  digital imaging products and computers increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these increases were primarily the result of higher sales of digital music accessories associated with higher sales of digital music players included in our personal electronics platform  in addition to higher bluetooth wireless accessories and flash memory sales 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in home entertainment accessory sales 
sales in our personal electronics platform includes digital cameras  camcorders  toys  wellness products  digital music players and satellite radios increased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these sales increases were driven primarily by increased sales of digital music players  offset by decreases in most of the remaining personal electronics categories 
sales in our modern home platform includes residential telephones  home audio and video end products  direct to home dth satellite systems  and computers decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these decreases were primarily due to lower sales of telephones  home computers  and dvd players  which were partially offset by increased sales of flat panel televisions 
sales in our power platform includes general and special purpose batteries and battery chargers decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these sales decreases were due primarily to a decrease in sales of both general and special purpose batteries caused by factors such as reduced sales of products requiring batteries and customer tendencies to simply replace older cordless phones rather than replacing their batteries 
sales in our technical platform includes wire and cable  connectivity products  components and tools  as well as hobby and robotic products decreased in dollars  but increased slightly as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to the dollar decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of specialty tools 
sales in our service platform includes prepaid wireless airtime  bill payment revenue and extended service plans decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these decreases were primarily attributable to a change in the manner in which we recognize income associated with sales of prepaid wireless airtime 
beginning in  principally as a result of changes in our agreements with wireless carriers  we no longer record the full value of airtime purchased by customers  but rather record only our markup on the sale as revenue 
this change reduced our total company operated stores revenue by approximately million for  as compared to the corresponding prior year period  but had no impact on our gross profit or operating income 
other revenue includes radioshack company operated store repair revenue and other revenue decreased slightly in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues 
kiosks kiosk sales increased million for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year period 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of sprint kiosks in late that operated for all of kiosk sales consist primarily of wireless platform sales and related accessory platform sales 
other sales other sales include sales to our independent dealers  outside sales from our service centers  sales generated by our www 
radioshack 
com web site  sales in our nine now closed canadian company operated stores  sales to commercial customers  and outside sales of our global sourcing operations and manufacturing facilities 
these sales were up million for  or an increase of  when compared to these sales increases were primarily due to an increase in sales to our network of independent dealers and an increase in web site sales 
these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of five service centers  which we sold or closed in gross profit consolidated gross profit for was  million or of net sales and operating revenues  compared with  million or of net sales and operating revenues in  resulting in a decrease in gross profit 
the decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of a decrease in net sales and operating revenues  the impact of inventory liquidation related to the store closures involved in the turnaround program  a mix change toward lower gross margin products  including higher relative sales of digital music players and lower margin accessories  and more aggressive promotional activity 
the gross margin rate was positively affected by the change in the manner in which we began recognizing income associated with sales of prepaid wireless airtime in  as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense our consolidated sg a expense increased slightly in dollars and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the dollar increase for was primarily due to an increase in payroll and commissions  plus rent expense  this increase was substantially offset by a decrease in advertising expense 
however  headcount reductions from store closures  service center closures and corporate headquarters reductions helped lower compensation expense excluding the severance charges in the third and fourth quarters of we expect sg a to be lower in when compared to  due to an ongoing scrutiny of costs  the impact of store closures and cost reductions commencing in the second half of the table below summarizes the breakdown of various components of our consolidated sg a expense and its related percentage of total net sales and operating revenues 
year ended december  in millions dollars of sales revenues dollars of sales revenues dollars of sales revenues payroll and commissions rent advertising other taxes excludes income taxes utilities and telephone insurance professional fees credit card fees licenses repairs and maintenance recruiting  training employee relations stock purchase and savings plans printing  postage and office supplies travel warranty and product repair other payroll and commissions expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues 
these increases were primarily the result of pay plan changes for radioshack company operated stores initiated in early  severance related to our turnaround program  utilization of more labor hours in our company operated stores during the first half of the year  and increased headcount in our kiosk operations 
we also began the required expensing of stock options as of january   which increased compensation expense by million  when compared to rent expense increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
the rent increase was primarily driven by a full year of rental payments on our corporate campus  as well as the addition of kiosk locations  which was partially offset by store closures 
advertising expense decreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
this decrease was primarily due to a change in our media strategy  as we changed the mix of media used in our advertising program from television to more radio and newspaper usage  as well as reduced sponsorship programs 
professional fees increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
the increase relates to the defense costs for certain class action lawsuits  including million of the million discussed under note litigation to our notes to consolidated financial statements  as well as the cost of consultants engaged in various projects 
other sg a expense includes lease buyouts associated with the turnaround program for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization the table below gives a summary of our depreciation and amortization expense by segment 
year ended december  in millions radioshack company operated stores kiosks other unallocated consolidated depreciation and amortization due to the impairment of long lived assets discussed below and the closing of company operated stores in  we anticipate depreciation and amortization to be below the level 
impairment of long lived assets and other charges in february  as part of our turnaround program  our board of directors approved the closure of to radioshack company operated stores 
during the first half of  we identified the stores for closure and subsequently performed the impairment test 
based on the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these specific stores  it was determined that the net book value of some of the stores long lived assets to be held for use was not recoverable 
for the stores with insufficient estimated cash flows  we wrote down the associated long lived assets to their estimated fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss related to our radioshack company operated store segment 
by july   we had closed specific stores under the turnaround program  there were no additional closures under this program for the remainder of the year 
also  we purchased certain assets from wireless retail  inc during the fourth quarter of for million  which resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill and a million intangible asset related to a five year agreement with sam s club to operate wireless kiosks in approximately sam s club locations nationwide 
these assets relate to our kiosk segment 
as a result of continued company and wireless industry growth challenges  together with changes in our senior leadership team during the third quarter of that resulted in a refocus on allocation of capital and resources towards other areas of our business  we determined that our long lived assets  including goodwill associated with our kiosk operations  were impaired 
we performed impairment tests on both the long lived assets associated with our sam s club agreement  including the intangible asset relating to the five year agreement  and the accompanying goodwill 
with respect to the long lived tangible and intangible assets  we compared their carrying values with their estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow model  which reflected our lowered expectations of wireless revenue growth and the ceased expansion of our kiosk business  and determined that the intangible asset relating to the five year agreement was impaired 
this assessment resulted in a million impairment charge to the intangible asset related to our kiosk segment 
the remaining intangible balance will be amortized over the remaining life of the sam s club agreement  which is scheduled to expire in september the balance at december   was million 
with respect to the goodwill of million  we estimated the fair value of the sam s club reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model similar to that used in the long lived asset impairment test 
we compared it with the carrying value of the reporting unit and determined that the goodwill was impaired 
as the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value  we then compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
this resulted in an million impairment of goodwill  related to our kiosk segment 
additionally  based on historical and expected cash flows for company operated stores and kiosks  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to property and equipment and an impairment charge of million related to goodwill 
these impairment charges  aggregating million  were recorded within impairment of long lived assets and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
net interest expense consolidated interest expense  net of interest income  was million for versus million for  a decrease of million or 
interest expense decreased slightly to million in from million in this decrease in the interest expense during was attributable to lower average outstanding debt  which was partially offset by rising interest rates on our interest rate swap agreements 
interest income increased to million in from million in these changes were due to a higher average investment balance for  as well as increases in investment rates 
we anticipate net interest expense for will be below the level  due to larger average cash balances when compared to the prior year 
other loss income for the year ended december   we recognized a loss of million in other loss income 
this loss included million relating to our derivative exposure to sirius satellite radio inc sirius warrants  which was a result of the required mark to market accounting treatment of these warrants 
the additional million related to an other than temporary impairment of other investments 
during the first quarter of  we sold all rights  title and interest to the tandy name within australia and new zealand to an affiliate of dick smith electronics  an australia based consumer electronics retailer 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of million in other income in income tax provision our provision for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of for and for the fluctuation in the effective tax rate during was due primarily to the tax benefit associated with inventory donations occurring in the quarter ended june  during the second quarter of  we donated approximately million in inventory to charitable organizations in a manner that provided us with a tax deduction in excess of the inventory cost 
the entire tax benefit attributable to this charitable donation deduction is reflected in the effective tax rate for the second quarter 
the lower effective tax rates in were principally due to a favorable non cash income tax benefit of million relating to the release of a tax contingency reserve upon the expiration of the associated statute of limitations 
this reserve related to losses sustained in connection with our european operations  which were fully dissolved by the release of the reserve occurred in the third quarter of because the statute of limitations governing these issues expired on september  we anticipate the effective tax rate will increase in  primarily as a result of not repeating the donation activity previously discussed 
compared with results of operations net sales and operating revenues sales increased to  million in from  million in we had a increase in comparable store sales 
these increases were primarily the result of a increase in our wireless platform sales and a increase in our personal electronics platform sales 
a net addition of kiosk locations contributed to our overall sales increase 
kiosks were the primary driver of the wireless platform sales increase

kiosks kiosk sales increased million for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year period 
this increase was the result of an increased number of kiosk locations over other sales other sales were up million for  or an increase of  when compared to this sales increase was primarily due to increased sales to dealers over  in addition to e commerce and service center sales increases 
gross profit consolidated gross profit for was  million or of net sales and operating revenues  compared with  million or of net sales and operating revenues in  resulting in a decrease in gross profit and a percentage point decrease in our gross profit percentage 
these decreases were partially the result of write downs in the second half of as a result of our inventory obsolescence reviews  in which we identified a significant amount of slow moving inventory to remove from our assortment 
a mix change toward our lower gross margin kiosk channel also contributed to the overall decrease in our gross margin rate 
additionally  our merchandise mix among platforms shifted due to significant growth in the sale of digital music players and digital imaging products  as well as prepaid airtime refills  within the lower gross margin personal electronics platform and the service platform  respectively

cash provided by working capital components was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in cash provided by working capital components  as compared to the prior year  was primarily the result of decreases in inventory  accounts receivable  and accounts payable  net of increases in accrued expenses and income taxes 
cash flow investing activities cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively  while million in cash was provided in we received million in net proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our corporate campus during the fourth quarter of capital expenditures for these periods related primarily to retail stores and information systems projects 
additionally  included capital expenditures related to our new corporate campus

these cash and cash equivalents  along with cash generated from our net sales and operating revenues and  when necessary  from our credit facilities  are available to fund future capital expenditure needs

free cash flow our free cash flow  defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid and additions to property  plant and equipment  was million in  million in and million in the consecutive increases in free cash flow over the last three years were the result of a decrease in cash used by working capital components  primarily inventory  as well as a decrease in capital expenditures relating to the construction of our new corporate campus 
we believe free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing debt  change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value 
the comparable financial measure to free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities  which was million in  million in and million in we do not intend the presentation of free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
the following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow 
year ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment dividends paid free cash flow capital structure and financial condition we consider our capital structure and financial condition to be sound 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december   as a resource for our funding needs 
additionally  we have available to us million of bank credit facilities 
as of december   we had no borrowings under these credit facilities 
for a discussion of the expected effect of our turnaround program on capital structure and financial condition  see financial impact of turnaround program below 
debt obligations debt ratings below are the agencies ratings by category  as well as their respective current outlook for the ratings  as of february  standard category and poor s moody s fitch senior unsecured debt bb baa bb outlook negative negative negative commercial paper b p b on february   fitch changed its long term rating outlook to negative 
in addition  on february   moody s placed our ratings under review for a possible downgrade 
both of these actions followed our announcement of calendar earnings  our turnaround program  and other factors 
moody s concluded its review of our ratings on march   and reaffirmed our existing short term rating of p  but lowered our long term rating to baa with a negative outlook 
on april   standard and poor s s p changed our long term rating to bbb with a stable outlook and changed our short term rating to a on july   s p lowered our outlook to negative after the release of our second quarter earnings on july  on august   fitch changed our long term rating to bb with a stable outlook and changed our short term rating to b 
shortly after we released our results and filed our form q for the period ended september   s p and moody s reduced our ratings to their respective current ratings 
additionally  fitch changed our outlook from neutral to its current negative level 
factors that could impact our future credit ratings include the effect of our turnaround program  free cash flow  cash levels  changes in our operating performance  the adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy  the economic environment  conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries  our financial position and changes in our business strategy 
if further downgrades occur  they will adversely impact  among other things  our future borrowing costs  access to debt capital markets  vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy costs 
our senior unsecured debt primarily consists of two issuances of year long term notes and an issuance of medium term notes 
long term notes we have a million debt shelf registration statement which became effective in august in august  we issued million of year unsecured long term notes under this shelf registration 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum with interest payable on september and march of each year 
these notes contain certain non financial covenants and are due september  currently  we anticipate paying these obligations from cash generated during the year and existing cash balances 
on may   we issued million of year notes in a private offering to initial purchasers who in turn offered the notes to qualified institutional buyers under sec rule a 
the annual interest rate on the notes is per annum with interest payable on november and may of each year 
the notes contain certain non financial covenants and mature on may  in august  under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the sec  we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount of publicly registered notes 
the exchange resulted in substantially all of the notes becoming registered with the sec and did not result in additional debt being issued 
during the third quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an underlying notional amount of million and a maturity in september in june and august  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with underlying notional amounts of debt of million and million  respectively  and both with maturities in may these swaps effectively convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to a variable rate 
we entered into these agreements to balance our fixed versus floating rate debt portfolio to continue to take advantage of lower short term interest rates 
under these agreements  we have contracted to pay a variable rate of libor plus a markup and to receive a fixed rate of for the swap entered into in and for the swaps entered into in we have designated these agreements as fair value hedging instruments 
we recorded an amount in other non current liabilities  net  of million and million their fair value at december  and  respectively  for the swap agreements and adjusted the fair value of the related debt by the same amount 
fair value was computed based on the market s current anticipation of quarterly libor rate levels from the present until the swaps maturity 
medium term notes we also issued  in various amounts and on various dates from december through september  medium term notes totaling million under the shelf registration described above 
at december   million of these notes remained outstanding 
the interest rate at december   for the outstanding million in medium term notes was 
these notes contain customary non financial covenants and mature in january as of december   there was no availability under the debt shelf registration 
available financing credit facilities at december   we had an aggregate of million borrowing capacity available under our existing credit facilities 
these facilities consist of the following amount of facility expiration date million june million may these credit facilities support commercial paper issuance  as well as provide us a source of liquidity if the commercial paper market is unavailable to us 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities  nor were these facilities utilized during interest charges under these facilities are derived using a base libor rate plus a margin which changes based on our credit ratings 
our bank syndicated credit facilities have customary terms and covenants  and we were in compliance with these covenants at december  in june  we replaced our existing million five year credit facility  which was to expire in june  with a million five year credit agreement expiring may the new facility has a more favorable fixed charge coverage ratio and provides for the exclusion of cash turnaround expenses from the covenant calculation 
we also amended the million facility expiring in june to include similar covenants and terminated our million day revolving credit facility 
we believe that our present ability to borrow is adequate for our business needs 
however  if market conditions change  gross profit were to dramatically decline  or we could not control operating costs  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
additionally  if a scenario as described above occurred  it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings further  thereby increasing our borrowing costs  or even causing a further reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and or equity markets 
capitalization the following table sets forth information about our capitalization on the dates indicated 
december  in millions dollars of total capitalization dollars of total capitalization current debt long term debt total debt stockholders equity total capitalization our debt to total capitalization ratio decreased in from  due primarily to a million increase in stockholders equity 
long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased in due to million of debt becoming current during dividends we have paid common stock cash dividends for consecutive years 
on november   our board of directors declared an annual dividend of per share 
the dividend was paid on december   to shareholders of record on december  the dividend payment of million was funded from cash on hand 
operating leases we use operating leases  primarily for our retail locations  two distribution centers  and our corporate campus  to lower our capital requirements 
share repurchases on february   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with no expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to million in open market purchases 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million in the year ended december   under our approved repurchase programs but excluding the osr 
the funding required for these repurchases came from net cash generated from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents 
we also repurchased shares in the open market in to offset the sales of shares to our employee benefit plans 
as of february   there was million available under the million share repurchase program 
management suspended purchases under the million share repurchase program while our osr was completed as described below 
as of february   management had not resumed share repurchases under the million program 
on august   we entered into an agreement with a financial institution to purchase million shares of our common stock from the financial institution under the osr 
the average share price upon completion of the transaction was 
we funded this payment from available cash on hand and short term borrowings in the commercial paper market 
seasonal inventory buildup typically  our annual cash requirements for pre seasonal inventory buildup range between million and million 
the funding required for this buildup comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents as of december   as a resource for our funding needs 
additionally  borrowings may be utilized to fund the inventory buildup as described in available financing above 
construction and sale and leaseback of corporate headquarters we began construction of our new corporate headquarters in  which we partially occupied during the fourth quarter of our total campus construction and land costs were million  we completed construction in the first quarter of on december   we entered into a transaction in which we sold and leased back the buildings and certain of the property at our corporate headquarters  located in downtown fort worth  texas 
in connection with this transaction  we entered into a year triple net lease agreement in which we pay all operating expenses  with four five year options to renew 
we have retained ownership of other real estate adjacent to our corporate headquarters 
this transaction allowed us to repay approximately million of short term borrowings in the commercial paper market issued in conjunction with the osr and  subsequently  to reduce our credit facilities to million 
contractual and credit commitments the following tables  as well as the information contained in note indebtedness and borrowing facilities to our notes to consolidated financial statements  provide a summary of our various contractual commitments  debt and interest repayment requirements  and available credit lines 
the table below contains our known contractual commitments as of december  in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total amounts committed less than year years years over years long term debt obligations interest obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total purchase obligations include our product commitments  marketing agreements and freight commitments 
for more information regarding long term debt and lease commitments  refer to notes and  respectively  of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table below contains our credit commitments from various financial institutions 
in millions commitment expiration per period credit commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years lines of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments we have contingent liabilities related to retail leases of locations that were assigned to other businesses 
the majority of these contingent liabilities relate to various lease obligations arising from leases that were assigned to compusa  inc compusa as part of the sale of our computer city  inc subsidiary to compusa in august in the event compusa or the other assignees  as applicable  are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
our rent exposure from the remaining undiscounted lease commitments assuming no projected sublease income is approximately million 
however  we have no reason to believe that compusa or the other assignees will not fulfill their obligations under these leases or that we would be unable to sublet the properties  consequently  we do not believe there will be a material impact on our financial statements from any fulfillment of these contingencies 
financial impact of turnaround program as discussed previously  our turnaround program  as originally stated in february  contained four key components update our inventory focus on our top performing radioshack company operated stores  while closing to radioshack company operated stores and aggressively relocate other radioshack company operated stores consolidate our distribution centers reduce our overhead costs as of december   we considered our turnaround program substantially complete 
store closures as of december   we had closed stores as a result of our turnaround program 
our decision to close these stores was made on a store by store basis  and there was no geographic concentration of closings for these stores 
for these closed stores  we recognized a charge in of million for future lease obligations and negotiated buy outs with landlords 
a lease obligation reserve is not recognized until a store has been closed or when a buy out agreement has been reached with the landlord 
regarding the stores we closed as a result of the turnaround program during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the long lived assets associated with certain of these stores 
it was determined that the net book value of several of the stores long lived assets was not recoverable based on the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these specific stores 
we also recognized million in accelerated depreciation associated with closed store assets for which the useful life had been changed due to the store closures 
in connection with these store closures  we identified retail employees whose positions were terminated by december  these employees were paid severance  and some earned retention bonuses if they remained employed to certain agreed upon dates 
the development of a reserve for these costs began on the date that the terms of severance benefits were established and communicated to the employees  and the reserve was recognized over the minimum retention period 
as of december   million has been recognized as retention and severance benefits for store employees  with million in benefits paid to date 
additionally  as part of our store closure activities  we incurred million in expenses in primarily in connection with fees paid to outside liquidators and for close out promotional activities for the stores 
distribution center consolidations we closed a distribution center located in southaven  mississippi  and sold a distribution center in charleston  south carolina  in during the year ended december   we recognized a lease obligation charge in the amount of million on the lease of the southaven distribution center and a gain of million on the sale of the charleston distribution center 
we also incurred a million charge related to severance for approximately employees 
additionally  there were million in other expenses 
service center operations we closed or sold five service center locations during the year ended december   resulting in the elimination of approximately positions 
we recognized a charge of million and million related to lease obligations and severance  respectively 
this severance obligation was paid as of december  additionally  there were million in other expenses 
overhead cost reductions management conducted a review of our cost structure to identify potential sources of cost reductions 
in connection with this review  we made decisions to lower these costs  including reducing our advertising spend rate in connection with adjustments to our media mix 
during the year ended december   we reduced our workforce by approximately positions  primarily within our corporate headquarters 
we recorded charges for termination benefits and related costs of million  of which million had been paid as of december  inventory update we have been replacing underperforming merchandise with new  faster moving merchandise 
we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of  as a result of both our normal inventory review process and the inventory update aspect of our turnaround program 
the following table summarizes the activity related to the turnaround program from february   through december  in millions severance leases asset impairments accelerated depreciation other total total charges for total spending for  net of amounts realized from sale of fixed assets total non cash items accrual at december  all stores identified for closure under the turnaround program were closed as of july  additionally  we continue to negotiate buy out agreements with our landlords  however  remaining lease obligations still exist at december  there is uncertainty as to when  and at what cost  we will fully settle all remaining lease obligations 
see the allocation of our turnaround charges within our segments in note segment reporting 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  transactions  or special purpose entities 
inflation with the exception of recent increases in energy costs  inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our operations in the foreseeable future  unless international events substantially affect the global economy 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition  inventory valuation under the cost method  estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies  valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill  and stock based compensation 
we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the selection  application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private label and third party branded products and services to consumers 
revenue is recognized  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain products  such as wireless telephone handsets  require the customer to use the services of a third party service provider 
in most cases  the third party service provider pays us a fee or commission for obtaining a new customer  as well as a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer 
fee or commission revenue  net of a reserve for estimated service deactivations  is generally recognized at the time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third party service provider  while the residual revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
estimated product refunds and returns  service plan deactivations  residual revenue and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items 
if actual results differ from these estimates due to various factors  the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected 
a difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  inventory valuation our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average cost or expected sales price ie  market value 
the cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated external and internal freight  distribution  warehousing and other costs required to transport the merchandise from the vendor to the point of sale 
typically  the market value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost 
determination of the market value may be very complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer trends  competitive pricing  performance of similar products or accessories  planned promotional incentives  technological obsolescence  and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions 
if the estimated market value is determined to be less than the recorded cost  a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item 
differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold 
if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve 
estimation of reserves and valuation allowances the amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use our past history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims  in evaluating the amount of liability we should record 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate 
these revisions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position or liquidity 
we are insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  property and other liability claims  with deductibles up to million per occurrence 
this insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that may arise above the deductible 
we also have a self insured health program administered by a third party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period 
this estimate is based on information provided by either an independent actuarial firm or third party 
the information includes historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other factors we deem relevant 
a change in our insurance reserves at december   would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  as of december   actual losses had not exceeded our expectations 
additionally  for claims that exceed our deductible amount  we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representing expected recoveries  since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to the claimant 
we are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
as part of our evaluation of these tax issues  we establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
effective january   we began recognizing uncertain income tax positions based on our assessment of whether the tax position was more likely than not to be sustained on audit  as set forth within fin depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years  therefore  our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
additionally  we are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters 
a reserve has been established based on our best estimates of the potential liability in these matters 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
although we believe that our tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
these actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate  earnings  deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period of resolution 
valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  such as historical operating losses or plans to dispose of or sell long lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives 
the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using our risk free rate of interest 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value  and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded 
additionally  if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of the asset 
the impairment calculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives and discount rates 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to additional impairment charges  which could be material to our results of operations 
we have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangibles related to business acquisitions that have occurred during prior years 
the original valuation of these intangibles is typically based in part through a third party appraisal and may include the use of estimates that we provide concerning future profitability  cash flows and other judgmental factors 
we review our goodwill and intangible balances on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or intangibles might exceed their current fair value 
the determination of fair value is based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow and other comparable market analyses 
these valuation techniques require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future profitability  industry factors  planned strategic initiatives  discount rates and other factors 
if actual results or performance of certain business units are different from our estimates  we may be exposed to an impairment charge related to our goodwill or intangibles 
the total value of our goodwill and intangibles at december   was million 
stock based compensation we have historically granted certain stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  restricted stock and deferred stock units 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note stock based incentive plans for a more complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
at the date that an award is granted  we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period  which typically is the period over which the awards vest 
the restricted stock and deferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options with only service conditions is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the fair value of stock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing the monte carlo simulation model 
the black scholes merton and monte carlo simulation models require management to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected option life  expected volatility  and expected employee forfeiture rate 
we use historical data and judgment to estimate the expected option life and the employee forfeiture rate  and use historical and implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility 
while the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations  they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
additionally  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may have an adjustment to our financial statements in future periods 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   would have affected our net income by approximately million 
prior to calendar year  we followed the guidance under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
factors that may affect future results matters discussed in md a and in other parts of this report include forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are statements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of words such as expect  believe  anticipate  estimate  intend  potential or similar words 
these matters include statements concerning management s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions 
we specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report  including any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are made based on management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and  therefore  involve a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks were primarily the interest rate swaps noted in our md a and warrants we earned to acquire common stock of sirius satellite radio inc sirius 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short term interest rates 
interest rate risk exists with respect to our net investment position at december   of million  consisting of fluctuating short term investments of million and offset by million of indebtedness which  because of our interest rate swaps  effectively bears interest at short term floating rates 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in the interest rate applicable to this floating rate net exposure would result in a decrease in annual net interest expense of million 
this hypothesis assumes no change in the net principal balance 
our exposure to market risk  specifically the equity markets  relates to warrants we earned as of december  and  to purchase million and million shares  respectively  of sirius stock at an exercise price of per share 
we have recorded these as assets using a black scholes merton valuation method 
our maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value at december   of million 
we also manage our portfolio of fixed rate exposures  compared to floating rate exposure to reduce our exposure  to interest rate changes 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to long term interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt due to differences between market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt obligation 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would decrease million and increase of million  respectively 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point decrease in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would increase by million and million  respectively 
regarding the fair value of our fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates have no impact on our consolidated financial statements
