item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations during the second half of our fiscal year ended october  and all of fiscal  the u 
s 
housing market was impacted by a lack of consumer confidence  housing affordability and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures 
the result has been weakened demand for new homes  slower sales  higher hovnanian enterprises  inc cancellation rates  and increased price discounts and other sales incentives to attract homebuyers 
additionally  the availability of certain mortgage financing products became more constrained starting in february when the mortgage industry began to more closely scrutinize sub prime  alt a  and other non prime mortgage products 
the combination of these homebuilding industry and related mortgage financing developments resulted in significant decreases in our revenues and gross margins during compared with the same period in the prior year 
additionally  we incurred total land related charges of million for the year ended october  these charges resulted from the write off of deposit and preacquisition costs of million related to land we no longer plan to pursue and impairments on owned inventory of million for the fiscal year ended october  in addition to land related charges  the continued weakening of the market resulted in impairments of our intangible assets of million during the year  the majority of which related to intangibles in our southeast segment 
we continue to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term 
we have adjusted our approach to land acquisition and construction practices and continue to shorten our land pipeline  reduce production volumes  and balance home price and profitability with sales pace 
we are delaying planned land purchases and renegotiating land prices and have significantly reduced our total number of controlled lots owned and under option 
additionally  we are significantly reducing the number of speculative homes put into production 
while we will continue to purchase select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so  we currently anticipate minimal investment in new land parcels in fiscal we have also closely evaluated and made reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses  including corporate general and administrative expenses  reducing these expenses million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due in large part to a reduction head count from our peak in june given the persistence of these difficult market conditions  improving the efficiency of our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to be a significant area of focus 
we believe that these measures will help to strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that will develop in the future 
critical accounting policies management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements business combinations when we make an acquisition of another company  we use the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas 
under sfas  we record as our cost the estimated fair value of the acquired assets less liabilities assumed 
any difference between the cost of an acquired company and the sum of the fair values of tangible and intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
the reported income of an acquired company includes the operations of the acquired company from the date of acquisition 
income recognition from home and land sales we are primarily engaged in the development  construction  marketing and sale of residential single family and multi family homes where the planned construction cycle is less than months 
for these homes  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas  revenue is recognized when title is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing investments have been received and there is no continued involvement 
in situations where the buyer s financing is originated by our mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate intitial or continuing investment as prescribed by sfas  the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third part investor has been completed 
additionally  in certain markets  we sell lots to customers  transferring title  collecting proceeds  and entering into contracts to build homes on these lots 
in these cases  we do not recognize the revenue from the lot sale until we deliver the completed home and have no continued involvement related to that home 
the cash received on the lot is recorded as customer deposits until the revenue is recognized 
income recognition from high rise mid rise buildings we are developing several high rise mid rise buildings that will take more than months to complete 
if these buildings qualify  revenues and costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting in accordance with sfas under the percentage of completion method  revenues and costs are to be recognized when construction is beyond the preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of having a sufficient initial and continuing investment that the buyer cannot require be refunded except for non delivery of the home  sufficient homes in the building have been sold to ensure that the property will not be converted to rental property  the sales prices are collectible and the aggregate sales proceeds and the total cost of the building can be reasonably estimated 
we currently do not have any buildings that meet these criteria  therefore the revenues from delivering homes in high rise mid rise buildings are recognized when title is conveyed to the buyer  adequate cash payment has been received and there is no continued involvement with respect to that home 
income recognition from mortgage loans profits and losses relating to the sale of mortgage loans are recognized when legal control passes to the buyer of the mortgage and the sales price is collected 
interest income recognition for mortgage loans receivable and recognition of related deferred fees and costs interest income is recognized as earned for each mortgage loan during the period from the loan closing date to the sale date when legal control passes to the buyer and the sale price is collected 
all fees related to the origination of mortgage loans and direct loan origination costs are deferred and hovnanian enterprises  inc recorded as either a an adjustment to the related mortgage loans upon the closing of a loan or b recognized as a deferred asset or deferred revenue while the loan is in process 
these fees and costs include loan origination fees  loan discount  and salaries and wages 
such deferred fees and costs relating to the closed loans are recognized over the life of the loans as an adjustment of yield or taken into operations upon sale of the loan to a third party investor 
inventories inventories and long lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less direct costs to sell 
fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
construction costs are accumulated during the period of construction and charged to cost of sales under specific identification methods 
land  land development  and common facility costs are allocated based on buildable acres to product types within each community  then charged to cost of sales equally based upon the number of homes to be constructed in each product type 
for inventories of communities under development  a loss is recorded when events and circumstances indicate impairment and the undiscounted future cash flows generated are less than the related carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is the difference between the book value of the individual community  and the discounted future cash flows generated from expected revenue of the individual community  less the associated costs to complete and direct costs to sell  which approximate fair value 
for land held for sale  a loss is recorded if the fair value less cost to sell is below the carrying amount 
the loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value less cost to sell 
the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of a community are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations 
these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates of the amounts and timing of revenues and costs and other factors which  in turn  are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated cash flows or fair value decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairments related to current and future communities 
insurance deductible reserves for homes delivered in fiscal  our deductible is million per occurrence with an aggregate million for premise liability claims and an aggregate million for construction defect claims under our general liability insurance 
our worker s compensation insurance deductible was million in fiscal and million per occurrence in fiscal reserves have been established for construction defect and worker s compensation claims based upon actuarial analysis of estimated losses for fiscal and fiscal we engage a third party actuary that uses our historical warranty data to estimate our unpaid claims  claim adjustment expenses and incurred but not reported claims reserves for the risks that we are assuming under the general liability and workers compensation programs 
the estimates include provisions for inflation  claims handling and legal fees 
these estimates are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build  claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices and legal interpretations  among others 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts  actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 
interest in accordance with sfas capitalization of interest cost  interest incurred is first capitalized to properties under development during the land development and home construction period and expensed along with the associated cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
interest in excess of interest capitalized or interest incurred on borrowings directly related to properties not under development is expensed immediately in other interest 
land options costs are capitalized when incurred and either included as part of the purchase price when the land is acquired or charged to operations when we determine we will not exercise the option 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb revision to interpretation no 
fin r consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 sfas no 
accounting for product financing arrangements sfas  sfas no 
accounting for leases sfas  and emerging issues task force eitf no 
the effects of lessee involvement in asset construction eitf  we record on the consolidated balance sheets specific performance options  options with variable interest entities  and other options under consolidated inventory not owned with the offset to liabilities from inventory not owned  minority interest from inventory not owned and minority interest from consolidated joint ventures 
unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures investments in unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we recognize our proportionate share of earnings and losses earned by the joint venture upon the delivery of lots or homes to third parties 
our ownership interest in joint ventures varies but is generally less than or equal to 
in determining whether or not we must consolidate joint ventures where we are the managing member of the joint venture  we consider the guidance in eitf in assessing whether the other partners have specific rights to overcome the presumption of control by us as the manager of the joint venture 
in most cases  the presumption is overcome because the joint venture agreements require that both partners agree on establishing the operating and capital decisions of the partnership  including budgets  in the ordinary course of business 
hovnanian enterprises  inc intangible assets the intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet are goodwill  which has an indefinite life  and definite life intangibles  including tradenames  architectural designs  distribution processes  and contractual agreements resulting from our acquisitions 
we no longer amortize goodwill  but instead assess it periodically for impairment 
we performed such assessments utilizing a fair value approach as of october  we also assess definite life intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an intangible impairment is recorded when events and circumstances indicate the undiscounted future cash flows generated from the business unit with the intangible asset are less than the net assets of the business unit 
the impairment loss is the lessor of the difference between the net assets of the business unit and the discounted future cash flows generated from the applicable business unit  which approximates fair value and the intangible asset balance 
the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of a business unit are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated cash flows or fair value decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairments 
however  we only have million remaining in intangible assets and million remaining in goodwill so any future impairments are limited to these balances 
any intangible impairment charge is included in intangible amortization on the consolidated statements of operations 
for further discussion of the definite life intangibles that were impaired for fiscal  see the definite life intangibles variance explanation later in this item we are amortizing the definite life intangibles over their expected useful lives  ranging from one to four years 
the weighted average amortization period remaining for definite life intangibles was years as of october  post development completion and warranty costs in those instances where a development is substantially completed and sold and we have additional construction work to be incurred  an estimated liability is provided to cover the cost of such work 
in addition  we accrue warranty costs as part of cost of sales for repair costs over  to homes  community amenities and land development infrastructure 
our warranty cost accurals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
repair costs under  per occurrence are expensed as incurred 
also  we accrue for warranty costs under our general liability insurance deductible as part of selling  general and administrative costs 
the deductible for our general liability insurance for homes delivered in fiscal is million per occurence with an aggregate million for premise liability claims  and an aggregate million for construction defect claims 
both of these liabilities are recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred income tax deferred income taxes or income tax benefits are provided for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
if  for some reason  the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years or carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
sfas requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
see total taxes later in item for further discussion of the valuation allowances recorded during fiscal recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
capital resources and liquidity our operations consist primarily of residential housing development and sales in the northeast new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  the mid atlantic delaware  maryland  virginia  west virginia  washington  dc  the midwest illinois  ohio  michigan  minnesota  kentucky  the southeast florida  georgia  north carolina  south carolina  the southwest arizona  texas  and the west california 
in addition  we provide financial services to our homebuilding customers 
our cash uses during the twelve months ended october  were for operating expenses  land acquisition and development  construction  property plant and equipment  interest  repayment on our mortgage warehouse agreement  extinguishment of our senior notes  the repurchase of common stock  preferred stock dividends  and investments in joint ventures 
we provided for our cash requirements from housing and land sales  the revolving credit facility  financial service revenues  other revenues  distributions from joint ventures and tax refunds received in fiscal we believe that these sources of cash are sufficient to finance our working capital requirements and other needs 
for fiscal  we expect to generate cash flow from operations as we limit investments in new communities and delay further investment in current communities given the low demand for new homes 
while limiting this investment  we will continue to build and deliver homes from our current communities generating positive cash flow 
we also may enter into land sale agreements or joint ventures to generate cash from our existing balance sheet 
hovnanian enterprises  inc our net loss income historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net loss income and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  interest and other accrued liabilities  deferred income taxes  accounts payable  inventory levels  mortgage loans and liabilities  and non cash charges relating to depreciation  amortization of computer software costs  amortization of definite life intangibles  stock compensation awards and impairment losses 
when we are expanding our operations  which was the case in fiscal  inventory levels  prepaids and other assets increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
certain liabilities also increase as operations expand and partially offset the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels  prepaids and other assets 
similarly  as our mortgage operations expand  net income from these operations increase  but for cash flow purposes are offset by the net change in mortgage assets and liabilities 
the opposite is true as our investment in new land purchases and development of new communities decrease  which is what happened in fiscal  therefore we generated cash flows from operations in that period  primarily in the fourth quarter 
on july   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
as of october   approximately million shares have been purchased under this program  of which million and million shares were repurchased during the twelve months ended october  and  respectively 
on march   our board of directors authorized a for stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
all share information reflects this stock dividend 
on july   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock  with a liquidation preference of  per share 
dividends on the series a preferred stock are not cumulative and are paid at an annual rate of 
the series a preferred stock is not convertible into the company s common stock and is redeemable in whole or in part at our option at the liquidation preference of the shares beginning on the fifth anniversary of their issuance 
the series a preferred stock is traded as depositary shares  with each depositary share representing th of a share of series a preferred stock 
the depositary shares are listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol hovnp 
in each of fiscal and fiscal we paid million of dividends on the series a preferred stock 
as a result of restrictions in the indentures governing our senior and senior subordinated notes discussed below  we will be restricted from paying dividends on the series a preferred stock during fiscal and  if current market trends continue or worsen  we anticipate that we will continue to be restricted from paying dividends into fiscal our homebuilding bank borrowings are made pursuant to an amended and restated unsecured revolving credit agreement agreement with a group of lenders 
we and each of our significant subsidiaries  except for k 
hovnanian  the borrower  various subsidiaries formerly engaged in the issuance of collateralized mortgage obligations  a subsidiary formerly engaged in homebuilding activity in poland  our financial services subsidiaries  joint ventures  and certain other subsidiaries  is a guarantor under the agreement 
the agreement provides a revolving credit line and letter of credit line of billion through may loans under the agreement bear interest at various rates based on a base rate determined by reference to the higher of a pnc bank  national association s prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus or a margin ranging from to per annum  depending on our leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  and our debt ratings plus a libor based rate for a one  two  three  or six month interest period as selected by us 
in addition  we pay a fee ranging from to per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit line depending on our leverage ratio and our debt ratings and the average percentage unused portion of the revolving credit line 
at october   there was million drawn under this agreement we had issued letters of credit totaling million and we had approximately million of unrestricted homebuilding cash 
as a result of the borrowing base limits  as of october   we had million available to draw under this agreement 
however  the borrowing base increases as inventory increases 
we will need to either extend the agreement beyond may or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
the agreement has covenants that restrict  among other things  the ability of hovnanian and certain of its subsidiaries  including k 
hovnanian enterprises  inc k 
hovnanian  the borrower  to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on common and preferred stock and repurchase capital stock  make other restricted payments  make investments  sell certain assets  incur lines  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets and enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
the agreement also contains covenants that require the company to stay within specified financial ratios 
our level of home deliveries  amount of impairments and other financial performance factors are negatively affecting certain of these financial ratios and covenants  including the net worth requirement  leverage ratio and borrowing base covenant 
the agreement contains events of default which would permit the lenders to accelerate the loans if not cured within applicable grace periods  including the failure to make timely payments under the agreement or other material indebtedness  the failure to satisfy covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency 
as of october   we were not in compliance with the consolidated tangible net worth and leverage ratio covenants under the agreement 
as a result  on december   we obtained a waiver of compliance under these covenants and the revolving credit commitments were reduced to billion 
however  based on our current expectations  we will likely violate one or more of the agreement s covenants during to address this issue  we are currently negotiating an amendment to our hovnanian enterprises  inc agreement and although there can be no assurances  we believe we will have the amendment in place prior to any additional covenant violations 
as of october  the balance on the agreement was million and we had issued letters of credit totaling million 
if we are unable to obtain the amendment or maintain compliance with its terms  unless we were to obtain a waiver  the lenders would have the right to exercise remedies specified in the agreement  including accelerating the maturity of the outstanding balance on the agreement and letters of credit  which could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness 
in such a situation  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative financing 
in addition  if we are in default of these agreements  we may be prohibited from drawing additional funds under the agreement  which could impair our ability to maintain sufficient working capital 
either situation could have a material adverse effect on the solvency of the company and our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
on august   we terminated our credit agreement and agreement for letter of credit with citicorp usa  inc the termination resulted in a fee payable to us of million in accordance with the termination provision of the agreement  which stated that upon termination we would pay or receive a fee based on the change in our credit default swap rate 
this fee was reported as income in land sales and other revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  since we were only entitled to such a fee in the event the facility was terminated 
our amended secured mortgage loan warehouse agreement with a group of banks  which is a short term borrowing facility  provides up to million through march  interest is payable monthly at libor plus 
the loan is repaid when we sell the underlying mortgage loans to permanent investors 
we are negotiating an amended warehouse agreement to increase the borrowing amount to million through december  with interest payable monthly at libor plus 
although there can be no assurances  we believe we will enter into the amended agreement before the end of the fiscal first quarter of and we expect to close on this agreement sometime during the first quarter of fiscal we also had a commercial paper facility which provided for up to million through april  with interest is payable monthly at libor plus 
on november  we paid the outstanding balance in full and terminated the commercial paper facility 
we believe that we will be able to extend the warehouse facility beyond its expiration date or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
as of october   the aggregate principal amount of all borrowings under both agreements was million 
the warehouse agreement requires k 
hovnanian american mortgage  llc to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests 
as of october   we were in compliance with the covenants of the warehouse agreement 
at october   we had  million of outstanding senior notes  million  net of discount  comprised of million senior notes due  million senior notes due  million senior notes due  million senior notes due  million senior notes due  million senior notes due  and million senior notes due at october   we had million of outstanding senior subordinated notes  comprised of million senior subordinated notes due  million senior subordinated notes due  and million senior subordinated notes due we and each of our wholly owned subsidiaries  except for k 
hovnanian  the issuer of the senior and senior subordinated notes  and various subsidiaries formerly engaged in the issuance of collateralized mortgage obligations  a subsidiary formerly engaged in homebuilding activity in poland  our financial services subsidiaries  joint ventures  and certain other subsidiaries  is a guarantor of the senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
under the terms of the indentures governing our debt securities  we have the right to make certain redemptions and depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions  may do so from time to time 
we may also make open market purchases from time to time depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions 
the indentures governing the senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain restrictive covenants that limit  among other things  the ability of hovnanian and certain of its subsidiaries  including k 
hovnanian  the issuer of the senior notes and senior subordinated notes  to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on common and preferred stock and repurchase capital stock  make other restricted payments  make investments  sell certain assets  incur liens  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets and enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
if our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes is less than to  we will be restricted from making certain payments  including dividends on our series a preferred stock 
as a result of this restriction  we will be restricted from paying dividends on the series a preferred stock during fiscal and  if current market trends continue or worsen  we anticipate that we will continue to be restricted from paying dividends into fiscal the restriction on making preferred dividend payments under our bond indentures will not affect our compliance with any of the covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement 
the indentures also contain events of default which would permit the holders of the senior notes and senior subordinated notes to declare those notes to be immediately due and payable if not cured within applicable grace periods  including the failure to make timely payments on the notes or other material indebtedness  the failure to satisfy covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency 
as of hovnanian enterprises  inc october   we were in compliance with the covenants of these indentures 
in august  we purchased in open market transactions million of our senior notes due october  for million 
the net amount is reported as a gain in other operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the funds we had deposited in escrow for such purpose were used to pay the remaining principal balance of million of the senior notes on october  total inventory decreased million  excluding inventory not owned  during the fiscal year ended october  this decrease excluded the decrease in consolidated inventory not owned of million consisting of specific performance options  options with variable interest entities  and other options that were added to our balance sheet in accordance with sfas  sfas  and eitf  and variable interest entities in accordance with fin r 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional information on fin r 
total inventory decreased in the mid atlantic million  southeast million  southwest million  midwest million  and west million 
these decreases were due to decisions to delay or terminate new communities  as well as slow spending in current communities and due to inventory impairments recorded in these segments 
these decreases were offset by an increase in the northeast of million 
substantially all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next twelve months 
most inventory completed or under development was is partially financed through our line of credit  preferred stock and senior and senior subordinated indebtedness 
we usually option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we are only subject to the loss of the cost of the option and predevelopment costs if we choose not to exercise the option 
as a result  our commitment for major land acquisitions is reduced 
inventory impairment losses  which include inventory that has been written off or written down  increased million for the fiscal year ended october   compared to the prior year 
during the fiscal year  we incurred million in write downs primarily attributable to impairments as a result of a continued decline in sales pace  sales price and general market conditions  as well as increased cancellation rates 
in addition  we wrote off costs in the amount of million during the fiscal year ended october  partially offsetting this amount is million in recovered deposits that had been written off in the prior year as walk away costs because  in certain instances where we walked away from option contracts in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took legal action to recover our deposits 
in two of these cases  we were successful and received a portion of our deposit back in the first quarter of fiscal the following table summarizes home sites included in our total residential real estate 
the decrease in total home sites available in compared to is partially attributable to terminating certain option agreements  as discussed herein 
total home sites contracted not delivered remaining home sites available october  northeast   mid atlantic   midwest   southeast    southwest   west   consolidated total    unconsolidated joint ventures   total including unconsolidated joint ventures    owned    optioned   construction to permanent financing lots   consolidated total    lots controlled by unconsolidated joint ventures   total including unconsolidated joint ventures    october  northeast    mid atlantic    midwest   southeast    southwest   west   consolidated total    unconsolidated joint ventures    total including unconsolidated joint ventures   owned    optioned   construction to permanent financing lots   consolidated total    lots controlled by unconsolidated joint ventures   total including unconsolidated joint ventures   hovnanian enterprises  inc the following table summarizes our started or completed unsold homes and models  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  in active and substantially completed communities october  october  unsold homes models total unsold homes models total northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total     started or completed unsold homes and models per active selling communities active selling communities were at october  and at october  the decrease in total unsold homes compared to the prior year is primarily due to an effort to sell inventoried homes during fiscal in some instances  this required giving additional incentives to homebuyers on completed unsold homes 
investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million during the fiscal year ended october  this decrease is due to losses from joint ventures  primarily related to inventory and intangible impairments recorded by the joint ventures  and distributions made during the period  partially offset by additional contributions and advances to joint ventures 
as of october   we have investments in ten homebuilding joint ventures and ten land development joint ventures 
other than guarantees limited only to completion of development  environmental indemnification and standard indemnification for fraud and misrepresentation including voluntary bankruptcy  we have no guarantees associated with unconsolidated joint ventures 
receivables  deposits and notes increased million to million at october  this change is primarily made up of an increase in miscellaneous receivables of million due to a receivable from our insurance company related to a warranty claim that we expect to receive in  offset by a decrease in refundable deposits which occurs based on timing of completion of items triggering the reimbursement 
prepaid expenses and other assets are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change prepaid insurance    prepaid project costs    senior residential rental properties   other prepaids    other assets    total    prepaid insurance decreased due to amortization of a three year policy prepaid in fiscal prepaid project costs increased due to the growth in the number of communities 
prepaid project costs consist of community specific expenditures that are used over the life of the community 
such prepaids are expensed as homes are delivered 
other prepaids decreased due to the amortization of prepaid fees on our credit agreements  along with continued amortization of prepaid bond fees 
the decrease in other assets is partially due to a decrease in prepaid costs related to timing of financing proceeds received on completed models 
in addition  other assets decreased for our executive deferred compensation plan  as there were payouts in the first quarter of fiscal property  plant  and equipment decreased million to million at october  the decrease is comprised of million of additions  offset by depreciation of million and million of disposals 
additions increased principally to the new corporate office building constructed in red bank  new jersey and the relocation to a new building for our mortgage company  as well as computer software and equipment in connection with the continued implementation of our new enterprise wide system 
at october   we had million of goodwill 
this amount resulted from company acquisitions prior to fiscal as required by sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we performed an annual assessment of this goodwill for impairment  and given the current expectations of the markets with goodwill  primarily texas in the southwest and the mid atlantic there was no impairment 
definite life intangibles decreased million to million at october  the decrease was the result of amortization during the twelve months of million  and the write off of million for impaired intangible assets 
in fiscal  we determined that the intangible assets associated with our fort myers operations in the southeast were impaired  and wrote off the assets of million 
this resulted in a charge of million to intangible amortization on the consolidated statements of operations 
the remaining million was recorded against accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets because at the time of acquisition this was an accrual for contingent purchase price  hovnanian enterprises  inc however  because of the impairment  payment will no longer be made 
in addition  we wrote off an intangible asset of million to intangible amortization related to the tradename associated with the purchase of a california homebuilder  as we terminated use of the acquired tradename during the year 
in the fourth quarter  as the market continued to weaken in certain markets  we re evaluated our remaining intangibles for impairment and determined that the intangibles for our tampa  orlando  canton  and building products operations were fully impaired resulting in write offs of million  million of which offset a contingent purchase price liability in orlando that will no longer be paid 
also  in the fourth quarter we wrote off million for a tradename that we are no longer using from an acquisition in our mid atlantic segment 
financial services mortgage loans held for sale consist of residential mortgages receivable of which million and million at october  and october   respectively  were being temporarily warehoused and awaiting sale in the secondary mortgage market 
we may incur risk with respect to mortgages that are delinquent  but only to the extent the losses are not covered by mortgage insurance or resale value of the house 
historically  we have incurred minimal credit losses 
we have reserves for potential losses on mortgages we currently hold 
the decrease in the receivable from october  is directly related to a decrease in the amount of loans financed at october   combined with a decrease in the average loan value 
income taxes receivable decreased million to million 
the decrease primarily results from an increase in deferred tax assets of million as a result of temporary differences from inventory and intangible impairments recorded in fiscal  offset by recording valuation allowances of million for our deferred tax assets in fiscal see total taxes later in item for further discussion of the valuation allowances recorded during fiscal accounts payable and other liabilities are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change accounts payable    reserves    accrued expenses    accrued compensation    other liabilities    total    the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the lower volume of deliveries in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year 
the increase in reserves is due to lower charges to the reserve in compared to see note of the consolidated financial statements for more detail on warranty costs  which is the primary balance in the reserves account 
the decrease in accrued expenses is due to payments of accrued acquisition earnout obligations accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal that have not recurred in the decrease in accrued compensation was primarily due to the payout of our fiscal year fourth quarter bonuses during the first quarter of  combined with lower accrued bonuses for fiscal the decrease in other liabilities is mainly due to the reduction of an accrual for contingent purchase price for our ft 
myers acquisition 
also contributing to the decrease in other liabilities was a decrease in deferred revenue for homes financed through our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
nonrecourse land mortgages decreased million from october  to million at october  the decrease is primarily due to a mortgage that was paid off in fiscal  partially offset by a new mortgage recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  both in the northeast 
customer deposits decreased million from october  to million at october  the decrease is primarily due to the reduction in the number of homes in backlog from  at october  to  at october  also contributing to the decrease was less cash received in excess of billings related to homes that have customer construction financing arrangements in the southeast

unaudited quarterly housing revenues and net sales contracts by segment  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  for the years ending october    and are set forth below quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast     mid atlantic     midwest     southeast     southwest     west     consolidated total    sales contracts net of cancellations northeast     mid atlantic     midwest     southeast     southwest     west     consolidated total     quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast     mid atlantic     midwest     southeast     southwest     west     consolidated total    sales contracts net of cancellations northeast     mid atlantic     midwest     southeast     southwest     west     consolidated total    hovnanian enterprises  inc quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast     mid atlantic     midwest     southeast     southwest     west     consolidated total    sales contracts net of cancellations northeast     mid atlantic     midwest     southeast     southwest     west     consolidated total    our reported level of sales contracts net of cancellations has been impacted by a slow down of the pace in most of our segments and an increase in our cancellation rates over the past several quarters  due to weakening market conditions and tighter mortgage loan underwriting criteria 
to combat this slower pace  we ran a national sales promotion in september from this promotion we reported approximately  sales that were comprised of  contracts and sales deposits 
through november  we converted of those deposits into contracts and ended up with approximately  gross contracts from the sales promotion 
since the sale  of these contracts have canceled to date representing a cancellation rate thus far 
this compares to our consolidated cancellation rate of during the fourth quarter 
the cancellation rate represents the number of cancelled contracts in the quarter divided by the number of gross sales contracts executed in the quarter 
for comparison  the following are historical cancellation rates  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures quarter first second third fourth another common and meaningful way to analyze our cancellation trends is to compare the number of contract cancellations as a percentage of contract backlog 
the following table provides this historical comparison  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures 
quarter first second third fourth most cancellations occur within the legal rescission period  which varies by state but is generally less than two weeks 
cancellations also occur as a result of buyer failure to qualify for a mortgage  which generally occurs during the first few weeks after signing 
however  in recent quarters we have experienced a higher than normal number of cancellations later in the construction process 
these cancellations are related primarily to falling prices  sometimes due to new discounts offered by another builder  leading the buyer to lose confidence in their contract price and due to tighter mortgage underwriting criteria lending to some customer s inability to be approved for a mortgage loan 
in some cases the buyer will walk away from a significant nonrefundable deposit that we recognize as other revenue 
we expect that cancellation rates will return to a more normal level at some point as prices stabilize  but it is difficult to predict when this will occur  and the timing will vary by market 
an important indicator of our future results are recently signed contracts and our home contract backlog for future deliveries 
our consolidated contract backlog  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  using base sales prices by hovnanian enterprises  inc segment is set forth below dollars in thousands october  october  october  northeast total contract backlog    number of homes   mid atlantic total contract backlog    number of homes   midwest total contract backlog    number of homes southeast total contract backlog    number of homes    southwest total contract backlog    number of homes  west total contract backlog    number of homes  totals total consolidated contract backlog   number of homes    the decline in our backlog from october  to october  is a direct result of a falloff in our contract pace 
our net contracts for the full year of fiscal  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  declined compared to fiscal in the month of november  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  we signed an additional net contracts amounting to million

the dollar decrease from october  to october  is due to the reduction in deliveries and continued net price decreases as the market continued to weaken in also shown in the table are our results of gross margins  after cost of sales interest expense and before land related charges 
after deducting interest expense  which was previously capitalized and amortized through cost of sales  our homebuilding gross margin was for compared to for and for as a percentage of revenue  cost of sales interest has increased to in compared to in and in  as the delivery pace in our communities has decreased  which increases the life of the community and corresponding interest costs from carrying inventory longer 
the following table represents gross margin percentage before interest expense and land impairment and option write offs by segment year ended october  october  october  northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total homebuilding gross margin we sell a variety of home types in various communities  each yielding a different gross margin 
as a result  depending on the mix of communities delivering homes  consolidated gross margin may fluctuate up or down 
total homebuilding gross margins  before interest expense and land impairment and option write off charges decreased to for the year ended october  compared to for the same period last year 
for the past several years  our gross margin has been higher than where we would expect to see our normalized margins  which is approximately between and 
all segments gross margins have been reduced by the change in sales pace  sales price and general market conditions 
the southwest has not been as affected  as compared to the company s other segments  primarily due to a lesser impact in the texas market 
the declining pace of sales in our markets in and has led to intense competition in many of our specific community locations 
in order to maintain a reasonable pace of absorption  we have increased incentives  reduced lot location premiums  as well as lowered some base prices  all of which have impacted our margins significantly 
in addition  homes for which contracts have been cancelled have typically been resold at a lower price  resulting in a further decline in margins 
as discussed in homebuilding results by segment below  certain of our segments experienced increases in average selling prices for the year ended october  compared to it should be noted however  that these increases are primarily the result of geographic and community mix of our deliveries  rather than an ability to increase home prices 
reflected as inventory impairment loss and land option write offs in cost of sales land charges  we have written off or written down certain inventories totaling million  million  and million during the years ended october    and  respectively  to their estimated fair value 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional explanation 
during the years ended october    and  we wrote off residential land options and approval and engineering costs amounting to million  million  and million  respectively  which are included in the total write offs mentioned above 
when a community is redesigned  abandoned engineering costs are written off 
hovnanian enterprises  inc option and approval and engineering costs are written off when a community s proforma profitability does not produce adequate returns on the investment commensurate with the risk and we cancel the option 
such write offs were located in all of our segments 
the impairments amounting to million  million and million for the years ending october   and  respectively  were incurred because of recent changes in the value of land in many of our markets and a change in the marketing strategy to liquidate a particular property or lower sales prices 
below is a break down of our lot option walk aways and impairments by segment for fiscal while the number of lots was spread across all of our segments  the dollar impact was concentrated in the northeast  southeast and west 
in  in total  we walked away from of all the lots we controlled under option contracts 
the remaining of our option lots are in communities that remain economically feasible  including a substantial number that were successfully renegotiated over the past six months 
the largest concentration of lots we walked away from was in the southeast almost entirely in florida

the increased spending in was primarily due to our acquisitions and overhead costs for organically expanding operations ahead of our expected future growth in housing revenues as open for sale communities increased from at the end of  to at the end of and at the end of however  the decrease in expenses in is the result of a reduction of personnel in order to better manage our overhead during the current market decline and decreases in incentive compensation  which is based on profitability 
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales

profits from land sales for the year ended october  were less than for the year ended october  the decrease in land sales and land sale profits has to do with our strategic decision in fiscal to sell a portion of the communities of a few larger developments that we had undertaken to one or more other builders 
although we budget land sales  they are often dependent upon receiving approvals and entitlements  the timing of which can be uncertain 
as a result  projecting the amount and timing of land sales is difficult 
other revenues increased million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  other revenues include income from contract cancellations  where the deposit has been forfeited due to contract terms  interest income  cash discounts and miscellaneous one time receipts

this was due to million of inventory impairment loss and land option write offs in  a basis point reduction in gross margin percentage before interest expense  and a million increase in selling  general and administrative costs  due to full year effects of the acquisitions  as well as growth in open communities 
southeast homebuilding revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in homes delivered  partially offset by a increase in average selling price 
the primary reason for the decrease in deliveries is the continuing declining market conditions in florida 
the average price increase is due to the change in the mix of communities delivering homes 
the loss before income taxes increased million to a loss of million  due mainly to million of inventory impairment loss  land option write offs in and million of intangibles impairments  as well as an basis point reduction in gross margin percentage before interest expense as the markets in this segment have become much more competitive 
homebuilding revenues increased in compared to primarily due to a increase in homes delivered and a increase in average selling price 
recent acquisitions in florida were the primary reason for the growth in deliveries and average selling price 
during  we acquired businesses in orlando and fort myers  florida and the tampa  florida operations acquired in fiscal continued to grow 
income before income taxes is down million to a slight loss of million  as the significantly higher profits from homes delivered were offset by million of inventory impairment loss and land option write offs in southwest homebuilding revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in homes delivered offset by increase in average selling price 
the reduction of deliveries resulted from a decline in the activity in the arizona market  as that market has been impacted by tighter mortgage lending requirements  thus eliminating certain potential homebuyers 
the increase in average selling price is due to the mix of communities that had deliveries in compared to income before income taxes decreased million to million in mainly due to million in land charges and a basis point reduction in gross margin percentage before interest expense 
homebuilding revenues increased in compared to primarily due to a increase in homes delivered and a increase in average selling price 
the growth in deliveries came from organic growth in our operations in both texas and arizona and the increase in average selling price is due to the mix of communities that had deliveries in compared to income before income taxes increased million to million in as the higher revenues as well as slightly better gross margin percentage before interest expense was offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses to support the growth in the operations 
west homebuilding revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in homes delivered and a decrease in average selling price 
this reduced revenue was further compounded by a  basis point reduction in gross margin percentage before interest expense

the decrease in deliveries was the result of the more competitive and slowing housing market in california throughout this reduced revenue was further compounded by a basis point reduction in gross margin percentage before interest expense  and million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was due to more open communities  and an increase in advertising costs to combat the declining market 
as a result of the above and million in inventory impairment losses and land option write offs in  income before income taxes decreased million to million in financial services financial services consists primarily of originating mortgages from our homebuyers  selling such mortgages in the secondary market  and title insurance activities 
during the years ended october   october   and october   financial services provided a million  million  and million pretax profit  respectively 
in financial services revenue decreased million to million due to the decline in the market and tightening mortgage lending standards 
revenues from october  to october  increased million to million consistent with our growth in deliveries 
in the market areas served by our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries  approximately   and of our non cash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the years ended october    and  respectively 
servicing rights on new mortgages originated by us will be sold as the loans are closed 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses include the operations at our headquarters in red bank  new jersey 
these expenses include our executive offices  information services  human resources  corporate accounting  training  treasury  process redesign  internal audit  construction services  and administration of insurance  quality  and safety 
as a percentage of total revenues  which have declined from the prior years  such expenses were for the year ended october   for the year ended october   and for the year ended october  despite the reduction in revenues in  we have maintained corporate general and administrative expenses relatively flat as a percentage of revenue by reducing costs through personnel reductions  reduced bonuses and other cost saving measures 
other interest other interest increased million to million for the year ended october  in  other interest increased million to million for the year ended october  the increase for is due to the interest on completed homes in backlog in fort myers  unsold homes in completed high rise communities and interest on land in planning being expensed as incurred 
the interest related to fort myers was capitalized during construction  but now many of the homes are complete 
when we incur interest on completed homes  it is expensed as it no longer qualifies for capitalization 
other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous residential housing operations expenses  senior rental residential property operations  earnout payments from homebuilding company acquisitions  minority interest relating to consolidated joint ventures  and corporate owned life insurance 
other operations decreased million to million for the year ended october  and increased million to million for the year ended october  the decrease is primarily due to decreased accrued earnout obligations  resulting from two earnout agreements ending and lower profits in fiscal  compared to the prior year 
other operations was further decreased by reduced profits from a consolidated joint venture that has finished delivering the homes in its community 
the increase in other operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher earnout obligations for certain acquisitions  and an increase in minority interest expense on a consolidated joint venture in the northeast 
intangible amortization we are amortizing our definite life intangibles over their expected useful life  ranging from one to four years 
intangible amortization increased million for the year ended october   when compared to the same period last year 
the increase for the year ended october  was primarily the result of the impairment of intangible assets of million discussed above 
the amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended october  this increase is primarily due the impairment of intangible assets of million previously discussed  as well as additional amortization from our acquisitions 
loss income from unconsolidated joint ventures loss income from unconsolidated joint ventures consists of our share of the losses or earnings of the joint venture 
the balance decreased million to a loss of million for the year ended october  and decreased million to million for the year ended october  the decrease in is primarily related to our share of the losses from inventory impairments  land option and walk away costs  and the write off of the intangibles from our joint venture with blackstone real estate advisors 
the decrease in is primarily related to the completion of one of our homebuilding joint ventures in the northeast 
off balance sheet financing in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital hovnanian enterprises  inc investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
at october   we had million in option deposits in cash and letters of credit to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of billion 
our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the nonrefundable deposits  letters of credit and other nonrefundable amounts incurred 
we have no material third party guarantees 
however  million of the billion in land and lot option purchase contracts contain specific performance clauses which require us to purchase the land or lots upon satisfaction of certain requirements by both the sellers and the company 
therefore  this specific performance obligation of million is recorded on the balance sheet in liabilities from inventory not owned 
pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities vie  we consolidated million of inventory not owned at october   representing the fair value of the optioned property 
additionally  to reflect the fair value of the inventory consolidated under fin  we eliminated million of its related cash deposits for lot option contracts  which are included in consolidated inventory not owned 
since we do not own an equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to fin  we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners 
when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers  certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required 
in most cases  the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities have been based on the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing 
in these cases  it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity 
at october   the balance reported in minority interest from inventory not owned was million 
at october   we had cash deposits and letters of credit totaling million  representing our current maximum exposure associated with the consolidation of lot option contracts 
creditors of these vies  if any  have no recourse against us 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our aggregate contractual commitments at october  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt     operating leases      purchase obligations    total      represents our senior and senior subordinated notes  revolving credit agreement  other notes payable and related interest payments for the life of the debt of  million 
interest on variable rate obligations is based on rates effective as of october  represents obligations under option contracts with specific performance provisions  net of cash deposits 
we had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of approximately million and million  respectively  at october  related principally to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments 
we do not believe that any such letters of credit or bonds are likely to be drawn upon 
total taxes total taxes as a percentage of loss income before taxes decreased for the year ended october  to from for the year ended october  the year over year decrease was almost entirely due to recording a valuation allowance of million for our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income 
if  for some reason  the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years or carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
sfas requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
given the continued downturn in the homebuilding industry during the fourth quarter of  resulting in additional inventory and intangible impairments  we now anticipate being in a three year cumulative loss position during fiscal according to sfas  a three year cumulative loss is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable  and also precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets 
therefore  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets  for which there is no valuation allowance  relate to amounts that can be realized through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences or through carrybacks to the and years 
our valuation allowance increased from million at october  to million at october  the increase was million for federal taxes  and million for state hovnanian enterprises  inc taxes 
our million of deferred tax asset and net operating loss carryforwards expire between the years october  and octobert   of which million expires in the year ended october  inflation inflation has a long term effect  because increasing costs of land  materials  and labor result in increasing sale prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising house construction costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
recently in the more highly regulated markets that have seen significant home price appreciation  customer affordability has become a concern 
our broad product array insulates us to some extent  but customer affordability of our homes is something we monitor closely 
inflation has a lesser short term effect  because we generally negotiate fixed price contracts with many  but not all  of our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between three to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of our homebuilding cost of sales
