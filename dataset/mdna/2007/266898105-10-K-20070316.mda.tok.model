item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in risk factors 
overview dusa is a vertically integrated dermatology company that is developing and marketing levulan pdt and other products for common skin conditions 
our currently marketed products include among others levulan kerastick topical solution with pdt  the blu u brand light source  and the 
table of contents products acquired in the march  merger with sirius laboratories  inc  including  nicomide  nicomide t and the avar line of products 
in connection with our merger of sirius laboratories  inc of vernon hills  illinois  or sirius  we acquired all of sirius common stock in exchange for cash and common stock of dusa worth up to  of the up to   less certain expenses was paid in cash upon closing   was paid in shares of dusa s common stock also upon closing  and up to   of which would be paid in cash  and  of which would be paid in cash or common stock may be paid based on a combination of new product approvals or launches  and achievement of certain pre determined total cumulative sales milestones for sirius products 
the products acquired in this transaction  called the sirius merger  focus primarily on the treatment of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea 
 dusa shares were issued pursuant to regulation d and subsequently registered on a form s registration statement 
the number of shares was determined by dividing  by the lesser of or the average closing price of dusa s shares on the nasdaq stock market for the twenty trading days prior to closing date which was 
all of the shares have been subject to a lock up provision since the closing  however  approximately  were released from this restriction on march  and are freely tradable 
on march   a lawsuit was filed by river s edge pharmaceuticals  llc against us alleging  among other things  that  prior to our merger with the former sirius laboratories  inc  sirius agreed to authorize river s edge to market a generic version of nicomide  and that the united states patent covering nicomide issued to sirius in december  is invalid 
nicomide is one of the key products dusa acquired from sirius in our merger 
on june   the georgia court dismissed river s edge complaint 
river s edge also filed an application with the united states patent and trademark office requesting an inter partes reexamination of the nicomide patent 
the uspto has accepted the application and the parties have submitted their responses to the uspto s first office action 
on april   we filed a patent infringement suit in the united states district court in trenton  new jersey alleging that a river s edge niacinamide product infringes our united states patent  we have posted  with the court that is being held in an interest bearing account 
the parties are in the discovery stage of the new jersey litigation 
although the court issued a preliminary injunction against sales of river s edge s product in may   the injunction was lifted on march   due  in part  to the court s determination that the reexamination process presented sufficient changed circumstances to warrant the dissolution of the injunction 
we expect that river s edge will reenter the market with its product in competition with nicomide 
we expect that nicomide sales will be adversely impacted throughout the litigation process 
in the interim  we are considering alternative strategies aimed at mitigating market share loss 
we have reviewed the valuation of our intangible assets and goodwill associated with nicomide for impairment and have recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the remaining net book value of the intangible assets 
an unfavorable ruling in the uspto or in the new jersey litigation with respect to the validity of the nicomide patent  would allow generic manufacturers  including river s edge  to lawfully compete directly with us and would have a material negative impact on our revenues  results of operations and liquidity 
sirius  a dermatology specialty pharmaceuticals company  was founded in with a primary focus on the treatment of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea 
this acquisition has allowed us to expand our product portfolio  capitalize on cross selling and marketing opportunities  increase our sales force size  as well as provide a pipeline of potential new products  including clindareach which was launched in march  nicomide is an oral prescription vitamin supplement  while nicomide t is a topical cosmetic product 
both products target the acne and acne rosacea markets 
acne is a common skin condition caused  in part  by the blockage and or inflammation of sebaceous oil glands 
acne rosacea is a condition that primarily affects the skin of the face and typically first appears between the ages of and as a transient flushing or blushing on the nose  cheeks  chin or forehead  progressing in many patients to a papulopustular form clinically similar to acne vulgaris inflammatory acne 
given its resemblance to inflammatory acne  and the general public s limited knowledge of rosacea  the condition is frequently 
table of contents mistaken by patients as adult acne 
if untreated  rosacea has the tendency to worsen over time  although it can also wax and wane 
the avar line of products includes a number of leave on and cleanser formulations of sodium sulfacetamide and sulphur  a drug combination long known to have anti acne  anti inflammatory properties 
historically  we devoted most of our resources to fund efforts in order to advance the levulan pdt pd technology platform 
our drug  levulan brand of aminolevulinic acid hcl  or ala  is being used with light  investigationally  in a broad range of medical conditions 
when levulan is used and followed with exposure to light to treat a medical condition  it is known as levulan photodynamic therapy  or levulan pdt 
when levulan is used and followed with exposure to light to detect medical conditions  it is known as levulan photodetection  or levulan pd 
the levulan kerastick topical solution with pdt and the blu u brand light source were launched in the united states  or us  in september for the treatment of actinic keratoses  or aks  of the face or scalp under a former dermatology collaboration 
aks are precancerous skin lesions caused by chronic sun exposure that can develop over time into a form of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma 
in addition  in september we received clearance from the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to market the blu u without levulan pdt for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris and general dermatological conditions 
we are responsible for regulatory  sales  marketing  customer service  manufacturing of our levulan kerastick  and other related product activities 
our objectives include increasing the sales of our products in the united states and canada  continuing our efforts of exploring partnership opportunities for levulan pdt for dermatology in europe  launching levulan with our distributors in latin america and asia  continuing our levulan pdt clinical development programs for our moderate to severe acne indication as well as our pipeline product programs 
to further these objectives  we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with stiefel laboratories  inc in january granting stiefel an exclusive right to distribute the levulan kerastick in mexico  central and south america 
we expect launch of the product in brazil following receipt of acceptable pricing approval by government regulators 
the mexican regulatory authorities have approved the product for sale and we expect that the launch in mexico will also occur pending resolution of the final pricing by cmed in brazil 
similarly  we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with daewoong pharmaceutical co  ltd 
granting daewoong exclusive rights to distribute the levulan kerastick in certain asian countries 
regulatory submissions for korea are being prepared 
we are developing levulan pdt and pd under an exclusive worldwide license of patents and technology from parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario  canada 
we also own or license certain other patents relating to methods for using pharmaceutical formulations which contain our drug and related processes and improvements 
in the united states  dusa  dusa pharmaceuticals  inc  levulan  kerastick  blu u nicomide  nicomide t  meted  avar  psoriacap and psoriatec are registered trademarks 
several of these trademarks are also registered in europe  australia  canada  and in other parts of the world 
numerous other trademark applications are pending 
see sections entitled business licenses  and patents and trademarks 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to continue to incur operating losses through until sales of our products increase 
achieving our goal of becoming a profitable operating company is dependent upon greater acceptance of our therapy by the medical and consumer constituencies  and our ability to develop and or acquire new profitable products 
although we have experienced significant operating losses  our net cash used in operating activities declined in each successive quarter of we operate in a highly regulated and competitive environment 
our competitors include larger fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies 
many of the organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and 
table of contents facilities  greater experience in drug development and in obtaining regulatory approvals  and greater manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities than we do 
marketing and sales activities since the launch of our sales force have resulted in significant additional revenues as well as expenses 
kerastick unit sales to end users were  and  for twelve months ended december  and  respectively  including  and  respectively  sold in canada 
the net number of blu u units placed in doctors offices during the twelve months ended december  was including placed in canada 
as of december  and december   respectively  there were  and  units in doctor s offices  consisting of  and  in the us and and in canada 
during we began a blu u marketing effort to allow prospective customers to evaluate a blu u for a short period of time prior to making a purchase decision 
blu u commercial light sources placed in physicians offices pursuant to the company s blu u evaluation program are classified as inventory in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company amortizes the cost of the evaluation units during the evaluation period to cost of product revenues to approximate its net realizable value 
net revenues generated by the products acquired as part of our acquisition of sirius totaled  for the period march  date of acquisition through december  the substantial majority of these revenues were from sales of nicomide 
with the dissolution of the preliminary injunction which had previously enjoined river s edge from selling its generic substitute for nocomide  we believe that our non pdt drug products revenues will be materially adversely impacted for we have continued our efforts to penetrate the market by expanding our sales coverage in key geographic locations 
see section entitled management s discussion and analysis results of operations  marketing and sales costs 
we are encouraged with the year over year increase in pdt sales  as well as the positive feedback we continue to receive from physicians across the country that believe levulan pdt should become a routine part of standard dermatological practice 
we are continuing to explore opportunities to develop  market  and distribute our levulan pdt platform in europe and expect that our distribution partners  stiefel laboratories  inc for latin america and daewoong pharmaceutical co  ltd 
for asia will advance our international strategy 
we are also continuing to seek to acquire and or license additional dermatology products that complement our current product portfolio that would provide our sales force with additional complementary products to sell in the near term 
we believe that the issues related to reimbursement have negatively impacted the economic competitiveness of our therapy with other ak therapies and have hindered its adoption in the past 
we have continued to support efforts to improve reimbursement levels to physicians 
such efforts included working with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  and the american academy of dermatology association  or aada  on matters related to the pdt procedure fee and the separate drug reimbursement fee 
doctors can also bill for any applicable visit fees 
effective january   the cms average national reimbursement for the use of levulan pdt for ak s ambulatory patient classifications code apc code was increased 
the apc code is used by many hospitals 
the cms current procedural terminology code cpt code  which is used by private physician clinics using levulan pdt for treating aks was not increased for however  an increase was implemented as of january  we are aware that some physicians still believe that reimbursement levels do not fully reflect the required efforts to routinely execute our therapy in their practices 
therefore  we continue to support ongoing efforts that might lead to further increases in reimbursement in the future  and intend to continue supporting efforts to seek reimbursement for our fda cleared use of the blu u alone in the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne of the face 
most major private insurers have approved coverage for our ak therapy 
we believe that due to these efforts  plus future improvements  along with our education and marketing programs  a more widespread adoption of our therapy should occur over time 
we have been encouraged by the positive response from many physicians and patients who have used our levulan pdt therapy  but we recognize that we have to continue to demonstrate the clinical 
table of contents value of our unique therapy  and the related product benefits as compared to other well established conventional therapies  in order for the medical community to accept our products on a large scale 
while we cannot predict when product sales may offset the costs associated with these efforts  we expect that we will continue to generate operating losses through we are aware that physicians have been using levulan with the blu u using short incubation  and with light devices manufactured by other companies  and for uses other than our fda approved use 
while we are not permitted to market our products for so called off label uses  we believe that these activities are positively affecting the sales of our products 
we believe that some compounding pharmacies exceed the legal limits for their activities  including manufacturing and or selling quantities of ala in circumstances which may be inducing purchasers to infringe our intellectual property 
we believe that these activities are negatively impacting our levulan sales growth 
therefore  during the last two years we have filed lawsuits against compounding pharmacies  chemical companies  a distributor and sales representative as well as against several physicians  many of which have already settled favorably to us 
see section entitled legal proceedings 
as of december   we had a staff of employees  including part time employees  as compared to full time employees and part time employees at the end of  including marketing and sales  production  maintenance  customer support  and financial operations personnel  as well as those who support research and development programs for dermatology and internal indications 
during  with the addition of the sales force from sirius we increased the size of our sales force to from at the end of during we eliminated positions through a restructuring action  representing of our workforce  to align headcount more closely with our assessment of our resource requirements at this time 
these workforce reductions were made across all functions of the company 
we may add and or replace employees during as business circumstances deem necessary 
transactions during and early  dusa entered into a number of transactions  all designed to foster future growth of dusa and its levulan pdt 
stiefel laboratories  inc in january   we entered into an exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreement with stiefel laboratories  inc  or stiefel  covering current and future uses of dusa s proprietary levulan kerastick for pdt in dermatology 
the agreement  grants stiefel an exclusive right to distribute  promote and sell the levulan kerastick in the western hemisphere from and including mexico south  and all other countries in the caribbean  excluding united states territories 
dusa will manufacture and supply to stiefel on an exclusive basis in the territory all of stiefel s reasonable requirements for the product 
the agreement has an initial term of ten years 
the mexican and brazilian health regulatory authorities have granted their respective approvals to market the product  however  the launch of the product in brazil is dependent upon receipt of acceptable final pricing approval from brazilian government regulators at cmed 
we expect that the launch in mexico will also occur pending resolution of the final pricing by cmed in brazil 
stiefel will make up to  in milestone payments  a portion of which will be due upon receipt of acceptable final pricing approval of the product from brazilian regulatory authorities and the balance upon achievement of pre determined minimum purchase levels in the territory 
the parties are working with cmed to achieve this goal  however if acceptable pricing is not granted  the agreement may be terminated 
stiefel will prepare and file the regulatory applications in other countries in the territory subject to the terms of the agreement 
the parties have certain rights to terminate the agreement prior to the end of the initial term  and stiefel has an option to extend the term for an additional ten years on mutually agreeable terms and conditions 

table of contents merger with sirius laboratories  inc in march   we closed our merger to acquire all of the common stock of sirius laboratories inc of vernon hills  illinois in exchange for cash and common stock worth up to  sirius was a privately held dermatology specialty pharmaceuticals company founded in with a primary focus on the treatment of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea 
of the up to   less certain expenses was paid in cash upon closing   was paid in shares of dusa s common stock also upon closing in a private placement  and up to   of which would be paid in cash  and  of which would be paid in cash or common stock may be paid based on a combination of new product approvals or launches  and achievement of certain pre determined total cumulative sales milestones for sirius products 
with the launch of clindareach  one of the new sirius products  we will be obligated to make a cash payment of  to the former shareholders 
also  of the  shares of dusa common stock issued in connection with the merger  approximately  of such shares were released from a lock up provision of the merger agreement on march  the shares are freely tradable by their respective holders 
certain of the products acquired in connection with the sirius merger must meet certain minimum manufacturing and labeling standards established by the fda and applicable to products marketed without approved marketing applications including nicomide 
fda regulates such products under its marketed unapproved drugs compliance policy guide entitled  marketed new drugs without approved ndas or andas 
under this policy  fda recognizes that certain unapproved products  based on the introduction date of their active ingredients and the lack of safety concerns  have been marketed for many years and  at this time  will not be the subject of any enforcement action 
the fda has recently taken a more proactive role and is strongly encouraging manufacturers of such products to submit applications to obtain marketing approval and we have begun discussions with fda to begin that process 
fda s enforcement discretion policy does not apply to drugs or firms that may be in violation of regulatory requirements other than preapproval submission requirements and fda may bring an action against a drug or a firm when fda concludes that such other violations exist 
the contract manufacturer of nicomide has received a request from the fda for labeling information and justification for the belief that the product is exempt from drug approval requirements  has received a warning letter to cease manufacturing a different marketed unapproved drug  and has been cited for gmp violations 
we believe that the gmp issues do not directly involve our products 
there can be no assurance that the fda will continue this policy or not take a contrary position with any individual products 
if the fda were to do so  we may be required to make certain labeling changes and market these products as over the counter products or as dietary supplements under applicable legislation  or withdraw such products from the market  unless and until we submit a marketing application and obtain fda marketing approval 
any such action by the fda could have a material impact on our non pdt drug product revenues  particularly if the action were taken with respect to nicomide 
shortly after the closing of the merger  we became engaged in patent litigation with river s edge  a company that launched a generic nicomide product 
river s edge also requested that the united states patent and trademark office  or uspto  reexamine the nicomide patent claiming that it is invalid 
the uspto accepted the application for reexamination of the patent and the parties have submitted their responses to the first office action 
although the court issued a preliminary injunction against sales of river s edge s product in may   the injunction was lifted on march   due  in part  to the court s determination that the reexamination process presented sufficient changed circumstances to warrant the dissolution of the injunction 
we expect that river s edge will reenter the market with its product in competition with nicomide 
we expect that nicomide sales will be adversely impacted throughout the litigation process 
in the interim  we are considering alternative strategies aimed at mitigating market share loss 
if we do not ultimately prevail in our lawsuit  or if the nicomide patent is found to be invalid by the court or the uspto  our revenues from sales of nicomide will decrease permanently 
we expect to eliminate some expenses planned for and reallocate others to provide more support to levulan and our new product  clindareach 
we have reviewed the valuation of our intangible assets and goodwill associated with nicomide for impairment and have recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the remaining net book value of the intangible assets 

table of contents daewoong pharmaceutical co  ltd 
on january   we entered into an exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreement with daewoong pharmaceutical co  ltd  or daewoong  and daewoong s wholly owned subsidiary  dnc daewoong derma plastic surgery network company  and collectively with daewoong referred to as d d  covering current and future uses of the levulan kerastick for pdt in dermatology 
the agreement grants d d exclusive rights to distribute  promote and sell the levulan kerastick in korea  taiwan  china  including without limitation hong kong  india  indonesia  malaysia  philippines  singapore  thailand and vietnam 
we will manufacture and supply the product to d d on certain terms and conditions 
the agreement has an initial term of ten years subject to earlier termination and extension provisions 
d d will complete final integration and submission on our behalf of all registrations and regulatory filings for the product in the territory 
under the terms of the agreement  d d will make up to  in milestone payments to us   of which was paid on signing 
the remaining milestones are based upon contract execution  certain regulatory approval of the product from regulatory authorities  and achievement of pre determined cumulative sales targets in the territory subject to certain terms and conditions 
in order to maintain its exclusive rights  d d is obligated to purchase a certain number of units of the product and meet certain regulatory timelines 
we will manufacture the product in our facility in wilmington  massachusetts 
we will also receive a minimum transfer price per unit plus a percentage of d d s end user price above a certain level 
photocure asa on may   we entered into a patent license agreement with photocure asa whereby we granted a non exclusive license to photocure for esters of aminolevulinic acid  or ala under the patents we license from parteq  the licensing arm of queens university  kingston  ontario canada 
ala is the active ingredient in dusa s levulan products 
furthermore  we granted a non exclusive license to photocure for its existing formulations of its hexvix and metvix known in the united states as metvixia products for any dusa patents that may issue or be licensed by us in the future 
photocure received fda approval to market metvixia for treatment of aks in july and it would be directly competitive with our levulan kerastick product should photocure decide to begin marketing this product 
while we are entitled to royalties from photocure on its net sales of metvixia  this product may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market 
levulan lawsuits filed since december  we filed lawsuits against physicians in several states to prevent their unlicensed use of versions of our levulan brand of aminolevulinic acid hcl ala produced  by third parties for use in our patented photodynamic therapy pdt treatment for actinic keratosis  basal cell carcinoma  or acne 
the suits allege that these physicians perform patient treatments that are covered under patents exclusively licensed by dusa  resulting in direct infringement of these patent s 
additionally  some physicians were sued for infringement of dusa s trademarks and for violations of the lanham act for using the levulan brand name on their web sites and promotional materials  but performing patient treatments with ala obtained from other sources 
all of the lawsuits against physicians have settled favorably to us and dusa has the right to review the physician s books and records to verify ongoing compliance 
we have also sued two compounding pharmacies which we believed were inducing physicians to infringe our patents on the photodynamic treatment of acne or actinic keratosis 
these compounding pharmacies were selling ala to those physicians 
both of the suits against the compounding pharmacies have been resolved in dusa s favor  and dusa has the right to review their books and records to verify ongoing compliance 

table of contents more recently  we sued chemical suppliers in united states district court for the district of arizona and the district of utah  and a light device manufacturer  a distributor  and a sales representative in united states district court for the southern district of ohio  eastern division  alleging that these defendants induce physicians to infringe patents licensed to us  among other things 
one of the cases  the lawsuit against one of the chemical suppliers  has been resolved in dusa s favor  with dusa having the right to review its books and records to verify ongoing compliance 
the other cases are still at an early stage 
while we believe that certain actions of compounding pharmacies and others go beyond the activities which are permitted under the food  drug and cosmetic act and have advised the fda and local health authorities of our concerns  we cannot be certain that our lawsuits will be successful in curbing the practices of these companies or that regulatory authorities will intervene to stop their activities 
in addition  there may be other compounding pharmacies which are following fda guidelines  or others conducting illegal activities of which we are not aware  which may be negatively impacting our sales revenues 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods and that can significantly affect our financial position and results of operations 
our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed these policies and the underlying estimates used in applying these accounting policies with our audit committee 
since not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates  they are not all considered critical accounting policies 
we consider the following policies and estimates to be critical to our financial statements 
revenue recognition and provisions for estimated reductions to gross revenues photodynamic therapy pdt drug and device products 
revenues on the kerastick and blu u product sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is probable 
product sales made through distributors  historically  have been recorded as deferred revenue until the product was sold by the distributors to the end users because we did not have sufficient history with our distributor to be able to reliably estimate returns 
beginning in  we began recognizing revenue as product is sold to distributors because we now believe we have sufficient history to reliably estimate returns from distributors as of january  this change in estimate was not material to our revenues or results of operations 
certain device units are held by physicians for a trial period 
no revenue is recognized on these units until the physician elects to purchase the equipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
non pdt drug products 
we recognize revenue for these products in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on our reported results and relies on certain estimates that require difficult  subjective and complex judgments on the part of management 
we recognize revenue for sales when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which generally occurs on the date of shipment to wholesale customers  with the exceptions described below 
revenue is recognized net of revenue reserves  which consists of allowances for discounts  returns  rebates chargebacks and fees paid to wholesalers under distribution service agreements 
in the case of sales made to wholesalers as a result of incentives and that are in excess of the wholesaler s ordinary course of business inventory level  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer upon shipment and  accordingly  such sales are recorded as deferred revenue and the related costs as deferred cost of revenue until the product is sold through to the wholesalers customers on a fifo basis 

table of contents we evaluate inventory levels at our wholesale customers  which account for the vast majority of our sales in the non pdt drug products segment  through an analysis that considers  among other things  wholesaler purchases  wholesaler shipments to retailers  available end user prescription data purchased from third parties and on hand inventory data received directly from our two largest wholesale customers 
we believe that our evaluation of wholesaler inventory levels  as described in the preceding sentence  allows us to make reasonable estimates for our applicable revenue related reserves 
additionally  our products are sold to wholesalers with a product shelf life that allows sufficient time for our wholesaler customers to sell our products in their inventory through to the retailers and  ultimately  to the end user consumer prior to product expiration 
a summary of activity in the company s valuation accounts are as follows for the year ended december  provision actual balance related to provision returns balance acquired as sales made for sales or credits balance at part of in the made in in the at january  sirius current prior current december acquisition period periods period  accrued expenses returns and allowances accounts receivable prompt payment discounts our provision for returns and allowances consists of our estimates of future sales returns  rebates and chargebacks 
sales returns we account for sales returns in accordance with sfas no 
by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned 
we determine the estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns  but also by considering other factors that could impact sales returns 
these factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel  estimated shelf life  product recalls  product discontinuances  price changes of competitive products  introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products 
it is our policy to accept returns of non pdt drug products when product is within nine months of expiration 
we consider all of these factors and adjust the accrual periodically to reflect actual experience 
chargebacks and rebates chargebacks typically occur when suppliers enter into contractual pricing arrangements with end user customers  including certain federally mandated programs  who then purchase from wholesalers at prices below what the supplier charges the wholesaler 
since we only offer preferred pricing to end user customers under federally mandated programs  chargebacks have not been significant to the company 
our rebate programs can generally be categorized into the following two types medicaid rebates and consumer rebates 
medicaid rebates are amounts owed based on legal requirements with public sector benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
consumer rebates are amounts owed as a result of mail in coupons that are distributed by health care providers to consumers at the time a prescription is written 
since only a small percentage of our prescriptions are reimbursed under medicaid and the quantity of consumer coupon redemptions have not been substantial  rebates have not been significant to the company 
chargebacks and rebates in the aggregate were  for the year ended december  we offer many of our customers a prompt payment discount 
we evaluate the amounts accrued for prompt payment discounts by analyzing the unpaid invoices in our accounts receivable aging subject to a prompt payment discount 
prompt payment discounts are known within to days of sale  and therefore can be reliably estimated based on actual and expected activity at each reporting date 
the 
table of contents company records these discounts at the time of sale and they are accounted for as a reduction of revenues 
historically  our adjustments to actual have not been material 
the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by type of revenue reserve 
our estimate associated with returns and allowances is evaluated based primarily on historical returns experience relative to sales volumes  but also considers the length of time from the sale to the lapse of the return right 
there have been no material adjustments to our accruals based on actual returns 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are continually reviewed for slow moving  obsolete and excess items 
inventory items identified as slow moving are evaluated to determine if an adjustment is required 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular technological developments that could result in obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological development  or significant changes to our business model could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
we use sales projections to estimate the appropriate level of inventory reserves  if any  that are necessary at each balance sheet date 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
at december  and  respectively  total property  plant and equipment had a net carrying value of  and  including  at december  associated with our manufacturing facility 
as of december  and  respectively  we had intangible assets totaling  and  recorded in deferred charges and other assets relating to the unamortized balance of payments made in to a light source supplier related to an amendment to our agreement and to a licensor related to the reacquisition of our product rights in canada 
we have reviewed the valuation of our intangible assets and goodwill associated with nicomide for impairment as a result of a decision by the u 
s courts to dissolve a preliminary injunction that had previously enjoined a competitor from manufacturing and selling a generic and have recorded a write down of million in  representing the remaining net asset value of the intangible assets as of december  share based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas statement no 
we adopted sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective application method  and beginning with the first quarter of  we measure all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value based method and record share based compensation expense in our financial statements if the requisite service to earn the award is provided 
the pro forma results and assumptions used in fiscal years and were based solely on historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
the adoption of sfas no 
r did not affect our net cash flow  but it did have a material negative impact on our results of operations 
in accordance with sfas r  we recognize the expense attributable to stock awards that are granted or vest in periods ending subsequent to december  in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations

the total consists of sold in the united states and sold in canada 
our average net selling price for the blu u increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the decrease in blu u units sold in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is due primarily to lower canadian sales volumes 
during the fourth quarter of  we introduced a blu u evaluation program  which  for a limited number of blu u units  allows customers to take delivery of a unit for a period of up to months for private practitioners and up to one year for hospital clinics  before a purchase decision is required 
at december   there were approximately units in the field pursuant to this evaluation program 
the units are classified as inventory in the financial statements and are being amortized during the evaluation period to cost of goods sold using an estimated life for the equipment of years 
non pdt drug product revenues reflect the revenues generated by the products acquired as part of our march  acquisition of sirius 
total revenues for the period march  through december  were  the substantial majority of the non pdt product revenues were from sales of nicomide 
the products acquired from sirius all belong to the same therapeutic category  non photodynamic therapy dermatological treatment of acne and rosacea 
with the dissolution of a preliminary injunction which had previously enjoined a competitor from selling its generic substitute for nicomide  we believe that our non pdt drug products revenues will be materially adversely impacted for the increase in our total revenues results from the sirius acquisition  as well as from the efforts of our sales force and related marketing and sales activities 
with respect to united states sales  we increased our average selling prices  increased our direct selling efforts  became the sole us distributor of the kerastick  and reduced our overall sales volume discount programs  all of which have had a positive impact on our average selling prices during however  we must increase sales significantly from these levels in order for us to become profitable 
we remain confident that sales should continue to increase through increased consumption of our pdt segment products by our existing customers  as well as the addition of new customers 
however  with the dissolution of the preliminary injunction which had previously enjoined river s edge from selling its generic product  we believe that our non pdt drug products revenues will be materially adversely impacted for  which would make it more difficult to achieve profitability

kerastick gross margins for the year ended december  were  versus for the year ended december  similar to the increase in revenues  the increase in margin is mainly attributable to an increase in our average unit selling price  and increased levels of direct distribution to customers eliminating the cost of distributors 
our long term goal is to achieve higher gross margins on kerastick sales which will be significantly dependent on increased volume 
blu u margins for the year ended december  were  versus for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin is a result of an increase in the average selling price per unit  as well as  lower overall costs incurred to support the product line

due to this situation  we are realizing fluctuations in our margins as a result of both the timing of production and unabsorbed expenses 
this has been somewhat offset by an increase in the overall selling price per unit 
blu u margins for the year ended december   were compared with for the year ended december  the erosion on margin is directly attributable to the fact that in we sold newly purchased units with an associated production cost  whereas during the period  we sold units which had a zero net book value due to inventory impairment charges recorded during following termination of an agreement with a marketing partner 
the margin erosion is somewhat offset by an increase in the overall selling price per unit and a decrease in other blu u product costs
