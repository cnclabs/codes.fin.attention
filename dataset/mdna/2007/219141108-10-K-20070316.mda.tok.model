item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual uncertainties related to certain facilities cornell abraxas academy of this report for further discussion concerning this the reactivation of this facility and the related operating contract 
we closed the hector garza residential treatment center formerly the campbell griffin treatment center in the fourth quarter of and intend to reactivate this program in refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual uncertainties related to certain facilities hector garza residential treatment center in item of this report for further discussion concerning this facility 
we closed the jos arz academy in and are currently considering several options for use  including the operation of a new program 
facility program was acquired in april in connection with the company s purchase of correctional systems  inc csi 
los angeles city jails represents seven individual locations in los angeles  california and the surrounding area 
initial contract dates vary by agency and range from we manage a bed dual diagnosis program located within the special treatment center of the state operated dixon correctional center 
sentencing concepts represents five individual facilities in the following california locations anaheim  lake forest  san luis obispo  santa maria and stockton 
initial contract dates vary by agency and range from marketing and business development our principal customers are federal  state  and local government agencies responsible for adult and juvenile corrections  treatment and educational services 
we manage our business development efforts to address opportunities available in all of our divisions and potential markets 
while such opportunities necessarily include forming relationships with new customers  we also believe that further potential lies in the management of our existing relationships through improved bed management and through enhancements of our contract terms 
from time to time  we will also evaluate opportunities for accretive acquisition 
in most instances  we pursue development opportunities through requests for proposal rfps or requests for qualifications rfqs  which are submitted in response to government agencies solicitations for bids 
the decision to respond to such solicitations is based upon several factors  including management s assessment of customer needs  the company s ability to service the needs in an operationally successful and acceptably profitable manner  and the fit of the potential program within the company s existing portfolio and strategic objectives 
the solicitations generally require the bidder to demonstrate relevant operational experience 
furthermore  the response must also include descriptions of the services to be provided by the bidder and the price at which the bidder is willing to provide them 
services can include not only direct care  but also the design  construction  or renovation of the related facility 
if we believe a project described in an rfp is consistent with our strategic business plan  we will submit a proposal to the requesting agency 
when responding to rfps  we typically incur costs ranging from  to  per proposal 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs to acquire options to lease or purchase land for a proposed facility or to lease or purchase an existing building to house a program 
the preparation of a response usually requires four to weeks 
the award process usually takes an additional three to nine months 
if new construction is required by the contract  the selected company s operation of the facility generally begins between and months following award announcement  although in some cases as early as four months 
in instances where construction is required  our success depends  in part  upon our ability to acquire property that is not only satisfactory for programmatic needs but also that lies in a community where social opposition does not significantly impede our ability to operate 
we may incur significant expenses in responding to such opposition  and our response may not be successful 
in addition  we may choose not to respond to an rfp or may withdraw a submitted proposal if significant legal action or other forms of opposition are anticipated or encountered 
in addition to responding to rfps  we also rely upon court referrals  insurance or managed care referrals  and self referrals for business growth  particularly in our juvenile and adult community based treatment programs 
in such instances  court and community liaisons play a significant role in developing our growing network of clients 
contracts our facility operating contracts generally provide that we will be compensated via an occupant per diem rate  fees for treatment services  guaranteed take or pay terms  a fixed fee  or cost plus reimbursement 
factors we consider in determining billing rates include the specified programs provided for by the contract and the related staffing levels  wage levels customary in the respective geographic area  whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased  and the anticipated average occupancy levels that we believe could reasonably be maintained 
compensation is invoiced in accordance with the applicable contract and is typically paid on a monthly basis 
some of our juvenile education contracts provide for annual payments 
we pursue new contracts that leverage our existing infrastructure and capabilities 
the majority of our opportunities are other than take or pay contracts  which provide a fixed minimum revenue stream regardless of occupancy 
all of the other types of contracts produce revenue that varies with the number of individuals housed or served  the types of services provided and or the frequency of the service 
competition because our services encompass several diverse markets  we view our competition within market segments 
we believe our principal non governmental competitors in the adult secure market are corrections corporation of america  inc  the geo group  inc  and management and training corporation 
within our two other segments juvenile justice  education and treatment and adult community based corrections and treatment we typically encounter a significantly more fragmented competitor base  which includes not only for profit operators like ourselves but also not for profit organizations 
within the juvenile justice  education and treatment segment  some of our primary non governmental competitors include viaquest  youth and family centered services  securicor new century  and ramsay youth services 
our larger non governmental competitors in the adult community based corrections and treatment market include dismas house  bannum  gateway  salvation army  and volunteers of america 
employees at december   we had  full time employees and part time employees 
we employ management  administrative and clerical  security  educational and counseling services  health services and general maintenance personnel 
approximately employees at of our facilities are represented by unions 
regulations the industry in which we operate is subject to federal  state and local regulations administered by a variety of regulatory authorities 
generally  prospective providers of correctional  detention  educational  treatment and community based services must comply with a variety of applicable federal  state and local regulations  including education  healthcare and safety regulations 
our contracts frequently include extensive reporting requirements  including mandatory supervision with on site monitoring by representatives of our contracting government agencies 
in addition to regulations requiring certain contracting government agencies to enter into a competitive bidding procedure before awarding contracts  the laws of certain jurisdictions may also require us to award subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract with businesses owned by women or members of minority groups 
business concentration for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues were derived from multiple contracts with the bop 
the increase in the percentage for as compared to the prior two years is due to additional bop revenue in resulting from the activation of our moshannon valley correctional facility in april insurance we maintain general liability insurance for all of our operations at an amount equal to million per occurrence per facility and in the aggregate 
we also maintain insurance in amounts management deems adequate to cover property and casualty risks  workers compensation  and directors and officers liability 
our contracts and the statutes of certain states in which we operate typically require us to maintain insurance 
our contracts provide that  in the event we do not maintain such insurance  the contracting agency may terminate its agreement with us 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these requirements

with this in mind  you should consider the risks discussed below and elsewhere in this report and other documents we file with the commission from time to time and the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf 
resistance to privatization of correctional and detention facilities could result in our inability to obtain new contracts or the loss of existing contracts 
management of correctional and detention facilities  particularly of adult secure facilities  by private entities has not achieved complete acceptance by either the government or the public 
the movement toward privatization of correctional and detention facilities has also encountered resistance from certain groups  such as labor unions  local sheriff s departments  religious organizations and groups believing that correctional and detention facility operations should only be conducted by government agencies 
changes in the dominant political party in any market in which correctional facilities are located could have an adverse impact on privatization 
furthermore  some government agencies are not legally permitted to delegate their traditional management responsibilities for correctional and detention facilities to private companies 
in addition  as a private prison manager  we are subject to government legislation and regulation restricting the ability of private prison managers to house certain types of inmates  such as inmates from other jurisdictions or inmates at medium or higher security levels 
legislation has been enacted in several states  and has previously been proposed in the united states house of representatives  containing such restrictions 
any such legislation may have a material adverse affect on us 
any of these resistances may make it more difficult for us to renew or maintain existing contracts  to obtain new contracts or sites on which to operate new facilities or to develop or purchase facilities and lease them to government or private entities  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to the short term nature of government contracts 
many governmental agencies are legally limited in their ability to enter into long term contracts that would bind elected officials responsible for future budgets 
therefore  many contracts with government agencies  including the bop  typically either have a very short term or are subject to termination on short notice without cause 
the majority of our contracts have primary terms of one to three years 
our contracts with governmental agencies may contain one or more renewal options that may be exercised only by the contracting governmental agency 
some of these contracts may not be renewed by the governmental agency and no assurance can be given that the governmental agency will exercise a renewal option in the future 
in addition  the governmental agency may elect to solicit bids pursuant to a rfp or rfq rather than exercise a renewal option 
we may not be successful in responding to a rfp or rfq 
the non renewal or termination of any of our significant contracts with governmental agencies  our inability to secure new facility management contracts from others or our failure to successfully respond to a rfp or rfq could materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operation and liquidity 
to the extent we have made significant capital expenditures and have short term contracts with our customers that are not renewed or extended  we may not recover our entire capital investment 
budgetary pressure on federal  state and local governments may result in contract cancellation or a reduction in per diem rates  which would reduce our profitability 
our cash flow is subject to the receipt of sufficient funding of and timely payment by contracting governmental entities 
if the appropriate governmental agency does not receive sufficient appropriations to cover its contractual obligations  a contract may be terminated or the amounts payable to us may be deferred or reduced 
federal  state and local governments have encountered  and are expected to continue to encounter  significant budgetary constraints that may result in a reduction of spending on the outsourced services that we provide 
such budgetary limitations may cause the contractual commitments to be reduced or even eliminated  which would make it unprofitable to continue operating a certain facility and require us to find alternate customers or close such facility 
many states are facing significant budget deficits and are under pressure to reduce current levels of spending or control additional spending 
as a result of this increased budgetary pressure  in certain cases we have granted a few of our customers relief from formulaic increase provisions in their agreements and some of our customers have not included in their appropriation legislation amounts that would increase the per diem rates payable to us 
contractual rate increases are generally intended to offset increases in expenses and inflation 
to the extent rates are not increased or are reduced  our profitability will be adversely affected 
our ability to win new contracts to develop and manage correctional  detention and treatment facilities depends on many factors outside our control 
our growth is generally dependent upon our ability to win new contracts to develop and manage new correctional  detention and treatment facilities 
this depends on a number of factors we cannot control  including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  the demand for our facilities could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts  leniency in conviction and sentencing practices or through the legal decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws 
for instance  changes in laws relating to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could reduce the number of persons arrested  convicted and sentenced  thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them and community based services to transition offenders back into the community 
similarly  reductions in crime rates could lead to reductions in arrests  convictions and sentences requiring correctional facilities 
when seeking bids  most governmental entities evaluate the financial strength of the bidders 
to the extent they believe we do not have sufficient financial resources  we will be unable to effectively compete for bids 
additionally  our success in obtaining new awards and contracts may depend  in part  upon our ability to locate land that can be leased or acquired on favorable terms 
furthermore  desirable locations may be in or near populated areas and  therefore  may generate legal action or other forms of opposition from residents in areas surrounding a proposed site 
our profitability may suffer if the number of offenders occupying our correctional  detention and treatment facilities decreases or there is a shift in occupancy among our divisions 
our correctional  detention and treatment facilities are dependent upon governmental agencies supplying offenders and we do not control occupancy levels at our facilities 
we believe the rate of growth experienced in the adult secure sector during the late s and early s is stabilizing 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated under contracts that specify a net rate per day per resident  or a per diem rate  sometimes with no minimum guaranteed occupancy levels  even though most correctional facility cost structures are relatively fixed 
under such a per diem rate structure  a decrease in occupancy levels at a particular facility could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations at such facility 
a decrease in the occupancy of certain juvenile justice  education and treatment facilities would have a more significant impact on our operating results than a decrease in occupancy in the adult secure institutional services division due to higher per diem revenue at certain juvenile facilities 
social commentators and various political or governmental representatives suggest that community based corrections of adults may be emphasized in the future as alternatives to traditional incarceration 
we have historically experienced higher operating margins in the adult secure institutional services and the adult community based corrections and treatment services sectors than in the juvenile services sector 
a shift in occupancy among our segments of business operations could result in a decrease in our profitability 
a failure to comply with existing regulations could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of our contracts 
our industry is subject to a variety of federal  state and local regulations  including education  environmental  health care and safety regulations  which are administered by various regulatory authorities 
we may not always successfully comply with these regulations  and failure to comply could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of facility management contracts 
the contracts typically include extensive reporting requirements and supervision and on site monitoring by representatives of contracting governmental agencies 
corrections officers are customarily required to meet certain training standards  and in some instances facility personnel are required to be licensed and subject to background investigation 
certain jurisdictions also require that subcontracts be awarded on a competitive basis or that we subcontract with businesses owned by members of minority groups 
the failure to comply with any applicable laws  rules or regulations and the loss of any required license could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations at our affected facilities 
governmental agencies may investigate and audit our contracts and  if any improprieties are found  we may be required to refund revenues we have received  and or to forego anticipated revenues and may be subject to penalties and sanctions  including prohibitions on our bidding in response to rfps 
governmental agencies we contract with have the authority to audit and investigate our contracts with them 
as part of that process  some governmental agencies review our performance on the contract  our pricing practices  our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if the agency determines that we have improperly allocated costs to a specific contract  we may not be reimbursed for those costs and we could be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been reimbursed 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities by us or we otherwise determine that these activities have occurred  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government 
any adverse determination could adversely impact our ability to bid in response to rfps in one or more jurisdictions and significantly reduce the probability of our success in the bid process for future contracts 
if we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations  our ability to compete for future contracts and our financial condition may be adversely affected 
our failure to comply with contract requirements or to meet our client s performance expectations when performing a contract could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation  which  in turn  would impact our ability to compete for new contracts 
our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages 
in addition  our contracts often require us to indemnify clients for our failure to meet performance standards 
some of our contracts contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures 
although we have liability insurance  the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities 
competitors in our industry may adversely affect the profitability of our business 
we must compete with government entities and other private operators on the basis of cost  quality and range of services offered  experience in managing facilities  reputation of personnel and ability to design  finance and construct new facilities on a cost effective competitive basis 
while there are barriers for companies seeking to enter into the management and operation of correctional  detention and treatment facilities  there can be no assurance that these barriers will be sufficient to limit additional competition 
certain areas of our operation may not pose a significant barrier to entry into the market by private operators 
for example  private operators may not find it as difficult to bid for juvenile treatment  educational and detention services and pre release correctional and treatment services as they do adult secure institutional  correctional and detention services 
further  our government customers may assume the management of a facility currently managed by us upon the termination of the corresponding management contract or  if such customers have capacity at their facilities  may take inmates currently housed in our facilities and transfer them to government run facilities 
the resulting decrease in occupancy levels would reduce our revenue due to the per diem rate structure and could result in a significant decrease in the profitability of our business 
a disturbance or violent occurrence in one of our facilities could result in closure of a facility or harm to our business 
an escape  riot  disturbance or violent occurrence at one of our facilities could adversely affect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of our operations 
among other things  the negative publicity generated as a result of an event could adversely affect our ability to retain an existing contract or obtain future ones 
in addition  if such an event were to occur  there is a possibility that the facility where the event occurred may be shut down by the relevant governmental agency 
a closure of certain of our facilities could adversely affect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of our operations 
such negative events may also result in a significant increase in our liability insurance costs 
negative media coverage  including inaccurate or misleading information  could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to bid for government contracts 
the media frequently focuses its attention on private operators contracts with governmental agencies 
if the media coverage of private operators is negative  it could influence government officials to slow the pace of outsourcing government services  which could reduce the number of rfps 
the media may also focus its attention on the activities of political consultants engaged by us  even when their activities are unrelated to our business  and we may be tainted by adverse media coverage about their activities 
moreover  inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and  accordingly  our ability to bid for and win government contracts 
we often incur significant costs before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls and a risk of not recovering our investment 
when we are awarded a contract to manage a new facility  we may incur significant expenses before we receive contract payments 
these expenses include purchasing real estate  constructing new facilities  leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring and training personnel 
as a result  when the government does not fund a facility s pre opening and start up costs  we may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments 
in addition  payments due to us from governmental agencies may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures by our governmental customers to attain necessary budget approvals and finalize contracts in a timely manner 
several juvenile services contracts related to educational services provide for annual collection several months after a school year is completed 
in addition  a contract may be terminated prior to its scheduled expiration and as a result we may not recover these expenses or realize any return on our investment 
we may choose to undertake development projects without written commitments to make use of such facilities 
we may not be able to obtain contracts for these facilities in a timely fashion  if at all 
to the extent we do not obtain contracts  we could be unable to recover our investment and our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we may be unable to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel necessary to sustain our business 
our delivery of services is labor intensive 
when we are awarded a contract  we must hire operating management  security  case management and other personnel 
the success of our business requires that we attract  develop  motivate and retain these personnel 
our ability to recruit and retain qualified individuals varies by facility and is related to the socio economic factors in the particular community in which the facility operates 
the department of labor wages we offer our employees are often higher than wages they could obtain elsewhere in the community 
however  if the local economy where a facility is located is robust and unemployment is low  we may have difficulty hiring and retaining qualified personnel 
in addition  there are inherent risks associated with the nature of the services we provide  which could cause certain qualified individuals to seek other employment opportunities 
we have experienced high turnover of personnel in our juvenile and adult secure facilities within the first year of their employment 
our inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of personnel could adversely affect our business 
if we do not successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may be unable to manage businesses that we may acquire profitably or integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses  delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations 
acquisitions generally require the integration of facilities  some of which may be located in states in which we do not currently have operations 
moreover  business combinations involve additional risks  including diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel  assumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities  our becoming significantly leveraged as a result of the incurrence of debt to finance an acquisition  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities  amortization or charges of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  and dilution to our earnings per share 
also  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business could materially and adversely affect our reputation as a whole 
further  the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings we anticipated 
because environmental laws impose strict as well as joint and several liability for clean up costs  unforeseen environmental risks could prove to be costly 
our facilities  and any facilities that we may acquire in the future  may be subject to unforeseen environmental risks 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla imposes strict  as well as joint and several  liability for certain environmental cleanup costs on several classes of potentially responsible parties  including current owners and operators of the property 
other federal and state laws in certain circumstances may impose liability for environmental remediation  which costs may be substantial 
further  the operation of our facilities  and the development of new facilities  requires that we obtain  and comply with  permits and other authorizations under environmental laws 
obtaining such permits and authorizations may affect our existing facilities or could delay the opening of new facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have in the past incurred  and may continue to incur  significant expenses for facilities that we no longer operate 
if we close a facility  we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease  which would include  among other things  payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term 
we may also be required to incur other expenses with respect to such facilities 
the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open underperforming facilities 
as a result  ongoing lease operations at closed or under performing facilities could impair our results of operations 
we may continue to operate under unprofitable contracts at facilities that we own to offset expenses associated with ownership of the facility 
if we close a facility that we own  we will remain obligated for expenses associated with the facility 
if our operations are unprofitable at a leased facility or if the leased facility is performing significantly below targeted levels  we would typically terminate the contract and the lease 
however  we may continue to operate our contract at an owned facility to offset the expenses associated with ownership 
continued performance of such a contract could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we depend on a limited number of governmental customers for significant portion of our revenues 
we currently derive  and expect to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from the bop and various state agencies 
the loss of  or a significant decrease in  business from the bop or those state agencies could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our bop contracts accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  million  of our total revenues for the year ended december  million and for the year ended december  million 
we expect to continue to depend upon the bop and a relatively small group of other governmental customers for a significant percentage of our revenues 
because our revenues can fluctuate from period to period  we may face short term funding shortfalls from time to time 
revenues can fluctuate from year to year due to changes in government funding policies  changes in the number of clients referred to our facilities by governmental agencies  the opening of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities and the termination of contracts for a facility or the closure of a facility 
our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter  based on the number of contracted days in each quarter 
because our revenues can vary  we may face short term funding shortfalls from time to time 
in addition  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
we are subject to significant insurance costs 
worker s compensation  employee health and general liability insurance represent significant costs to us 
we continue to incur increasing insurance costs due to adverse claims experience and rising healthcare costs in general 
due to concerns over corporate governance and recent corporate accounting scandals  liability and other types of insurance have become more difficult and costly to obtain 
in addition  as a result of the stockholder lawsuits brought within the last few years  our directors and officers liability insurance has increased 
unanticipated additional insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows  and the failure to obtain or maintain any necessary insurance coverage or the inability of an insurance carrier to perform under its obligations through issued coverage could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may be adversely affected by inflation 
many of our facility management contracts provide for fixed management fees or fees that increase by only small amounts during their term 
if  due to inflation or other causes  our operating expenses  such as wages and salaries of our employees  and insurance  medical and food costs  increase at rates faster than increases  if any  in our management fees  then our profitability would be adversely affected 
we are subject to risks associated with ownership of real estate 
our ownership of correctional and detention facilities subjects us to risks typically associated with investments in real estate 
moreover  correctional and detention facilities are relatively illiquid and therefore  our ability to divest ourselves of one or more of our facilities promptly in response to changed conditions is limited 
investments in correctional and detention facilities subject us to risks involving potential exposure to uninsured loss 
our operating costs may be affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing laws  ordinances and regulations  as well as the cost of complying with future legislation 
in addition  although we maintain insurance for many types of losses  there are certain types of losses  such as losses from earthquakes  riots and acts of terrorism  which may be either uninsurable or for which it may not be economically feasible to obtain insurance coverage 
as a result  we could lose both our capital invested in  and anticipated profits from  one or more of the facilities we own 
further  we could experience losses that may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage

while management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  overall trends in results of operations or cash flows  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur

southern peaks regional treatment center in january  we initiated legal proceedings in the lawsuit styled cornell corrections of california  inc v 
longboat global advisors  llc  et al  no 
cv in the superior court of fulton county  georgia under theories of fraud  conversion  breach of contract and other theories to determine the location of and to recover funds that we previously deposited into what we believed to be an escrow account in connection with the development and construction of the southern peaks regional treatment center 
of the funds previously deposited  approximately million remains to be recovered at december  in december  the jury awarded us approximately million in compensatory damages and approximately million in punitive damages  plus attorneys fees 
the actual damages portion of the award under the final judgment and decree judgment entered on december  was adjusted downward to the million actually lost by us 
the award for compensatory damages accrues pre judgment interest at a rate of percent from the date of loss through the date of judgment 
following the jury verdicts  we collected approximately million in january in funds which had been previously frozen under a temporary restraining order issued at the time that we commenced this litigation 
currently  one of the defendants has filed an appeal of the judgment 
due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the ultimate recovery of the funds previously deposited  we recorded an additional reserve in the amount of approximately million during the quarter ended december  we will continue to maintain our existing reserve of approximately million in an allowance for doubtful accounts against the corresponding balance as carried in other receivables at december  shareholder lawsuits in march and april  cornell  steven w

these lawsuits relate to our restatement in of certain financial statements 
these lawsuits all allege breaches of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets by all of the defendants 
a motion to dismiss the guitierrez and pagano lawsuits was filed 
the court dismissed the pagano action as duplicative of the guitierrez action 
the court granted the motion to dismiss the guitierrez action and the plaintiffs have appealed that ruling 
the menning action has been dismissed  but with an agreement that the plaintiff s claims as to cornell are tolled until days following the final resolution of the guitierrez case  including any appeals 
the plaintiffs in these cases have not quantified their claim of damages 
in december  we agreed to a proposed stipulation of settlement which  subject to the approval of the court  will resolve this action 
the settlement terms included reimbursement of up to million of plaintiff s legal expenses to be funded through our director s and officer s liability insurance as well as the implementation of certain corporate governance enhancements which we had implemented prior to the agreement 
the settlement was approved by the court in february we have not recorded any loss accruals related to these claims 
on october   a purported class action complaint was filed in the district court of harris county  texas  th judicial district no 
by ted kinbergy  an alleged stockholder of cornell 
the complaint names as defendants cornell and each member of our board of directors as well as veritas capital fund iii  lp veritas 
the complaint is a purported class action that alleges  among other things  that i the defendants have breached fiduciary duties they assertedly owed to our stockholders in connection with our entering into the agreement and plan of merger  dated as of october   with veritas  cornell holding corp  and cci acquisition corp  and ii the merger consideration is unfair and inadequate 
the plaintiffs sought  among other things  an injunction against the consummation of the merger 
the proposed merger was rejected at a special meeting of our stockholders held on january  we believe that the lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
we hold insurance policies to cover potential director and officer liability  some of which may limit our cash outflows in the event of a decision adverse to us in the matters discussed above 
however  if an adverse decision in these matters exceeds the insurance coverage or if the insurance coverage is deemed not to apply to these matters  it could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  results of operations and future cash flows 
other additionally  we currently and from time to time are subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including claims for damages for personal injuries or for wrongful restriction of or interference with offender privileges and employment matters 
if an adverse decision in these matters exceeds our insurance coverage  or if our coverage is deemed not to apply to these matters  or if the underlying insurance carrier was unable to fulfill its obligation under the insurance coverage provided  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
from august through may  our general liability and professional liability coverage was provided by specialty surplus insurance company  a kemper insurance company kemper group member 
in june  the illinois department of insurance gave kemper permission to proceed with a run off plan it had previously submitted 
the three year plan is designed to help kemper meet its goal of resolving  to the maximum extent possible  all valid policyholder claims 
in view of the risks and uncertainties involved in implementing the plan  including the need to achieve significant policy buybacks  commutation of reinsurance agreements  and further agreements with regulators  the plan may not be successfully implemented by kemper 
in the year ended december   we accrued a provision of million  and estimated our range of additional exposure to be approximately million with respect to outstanding claims incurred during this policy period with kemper which would become our obligation to resolve if not settled through kemper 
during the year ended december   kemper continued to implement its run off plan 
as a result  several of our significant claims were settled by kemper during in conjunction with these settlements  we recorded a charge against our existing accrual in the amount of million 
based on our analysis of the claims activity during the third quarter of  we felt it necessary to accrue an additional provision in the amount of approximately million during the third quarter of additional significant claims continued to be settled by kemper during the second half of as a result  we have released reserves of approximately million during the quarter ended december  at december   we do not believe there is significant exposure above our existing million accrual for those outstanding claims which could become our obligation to resolve if not settled through kemper 
while the outcome of such matters cannot be predicated with certainty  based on the information known to date  we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows

in january residential service capacity is comprised of the number of beds currently available for service or available upon the completion of construction or renovation of residential facilities 
at certain residential facilities  the contracted capacity is lower than the facility s service capacity

data presented excludes discontinued operating facilities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading provider of correctional  detention  educational  rehabilitation and treatment services outsourced by federal  state and local government agencies 
we provide a diversified portfolio of services for adults and juveniles through our three operating divisions adult secure institution and detention services  juvenile justice  educational and treatment services and adult community based corrections and treatment services 
at december   we operated facilities with a total service capacity of  and had three facilities with an aggregate service capacity of beds that were vacant 
our facilities are located in states and the district of columbia 
the following table which excludes data related to discontinued operating facilities sets forth for the periods indicated total residential service capacity and contracted beds in operation at the end of the periods shown  average contract occupancy percentages and total non residential service capacity 
year ended december  residential service capacity contracted beds in operation end of period average contract occupancy based on contracted beds in operation average contract occupancy excluding start up operations non residential service capacity data presented excludes discontinued operating facilities 
residential service capacity is comprised of the number of beds currently available for service or available upon the completion of construction or renovation of residential facilities 
at certain residential facilities  the contracted capacity is lower than the facility s service capacity 
we could increase a facility s contracted capacity by obtaining additional contracts or by renegotiating existing contracts to increase the number of beds covered 
however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain contracts that provide occupancy levels at a facility s service capacity or that current contracted capacities can be maintained in future periods 
occupancy percentages reflect less than normalized occupancy during the start up phase of any applicable facility  resulting in a lower average occupancy in periods when we have substantial start up activities 
average contract occupancy percentages are calculated based on actual occupancy for the period as a percentage of the contracted capacity for residential facilities in operation 
these percentages do not reflect the operations of non residential community based programs 
at certain residential facilities  our contracted capacity is lower than the facility s service capacity 
additionally  certain facilities have and are currently operating above the contracted capacity 
as a result  average contract occupancy percentages can exceed if the average actual occupancy exceeded contracted capacity 
service capacity for non residential programs is based on either contractual terms or an estimate of the number of clients to be served 
we update these estimates at least annually based on the program s budget and other factors 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from providing adult corrections and treatment and juvenile justice  educational and treatment services outsourced by federal  state and local government agencies in the united states 
revenues for our services are generally recognized on a per diem rate based upon the number of occupant days or hours served for the period  on a guaranteed take or pay basis or on a cost plus reimbursement basis 
for the year ended december   our revenue base consisted of for services provided under per diem contracts  for services provided under take or pay and management contracts  for services provided under cost plus reimbursement contracts  for services provided under fee for service contracts and from other miscellaneous sources 
although these percentages are generally consistent with comparable statistics for the years ended december  and  the percentage of revenues for services provided under per diem contracts has decreased and the percentage of revenues provided under take or pay and management contracts has increased between the comparable periods for and due primarily to the operations at the moshannon valley correctional center opened in april which is a significant take or pay contract 
additionally  the decrease in the percentage of revenues from per diem contracts between the comparable periods for and was partially offset by the increased operations of the regional correctional center in revenues can fluctuate from year to year due to changes in government funding policies  changes in the number or types of clients referred to our facilities by governmental agencies  the opening of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities and the termination of contracts for a facility or the closure of a facility 
factors considered in determining billing rates to charge include the programs specified by the contract and the related staffing levels  wage levels customary in the respective geographic areas  whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased and the anticipated average occupancy levels that could reasonably be expected to be maintained revenues for our adult secure institutional services division are primarily generated from per diem  take or pay and management contracts 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average per diem rates on our adult secure institutional facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in the average per diem rate in is due primarily to the opening of the moshannon valley correctional center in april we periodically have experienced pressure from contracting governmental agencies to limit or even reduce per diem rates 
many of these governmental entities are under severe budget pressures and we anticipate that governmental agencies may periodically approach us about per diem rate concessions 
decreases in  or the lack of anticipated increases  in per diem rates could adversely impact our operating margin 
revenues for our juvenile justice  educational and treatment services division are primarily generated from per diem  fee for service and cost plus reimbursement contracts 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average per diem rates on our residential juvenile justice  educational and treatment facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in the average per diem rate for is due to several factors including increased occupancy at the southern peaks regional treatment center and the reactivation of the cornell abraxas academy formerly the new morgan academy in the fourth quarter of for the years ended december   and  we realized average fee for service rates for our non residential community based juvenile facilities and programs  including rates that are limited by medicaid and other private insurance providers  of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in the average fee for service rates for is due to changes in the mix of services at our non residential juvenile facilities  as well as the addition of several new alternative education programs in the majority of our juvenile services contracts renew annually 
revenues for our adult community based corrections and treatment services division are primarily generated from per diem and fee for service contracts 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average per diem rates on our residential adult corrections and treatment facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average fee for service rates on our non residential adult community based corrections and treatment facilities and programs of approximately  and  respectively 
our average fee for service rates fluctuate from year to year principally due to changes in the mix of services provided by our various adult community based programs and facilities 
we have historically experienced higher operating margins in our adult secure institutional services and adult community based corrections and treatment services as compared to the juvenile justice  educational and treatment services division 
additionally  our operating margins within a division can vary from facility to facility based on whether a facility is owned or leased  the level of competition for the contract award  the proposed length of the contract  the mix of services provided  the occupancy levels for a facility  the level of capital commitment required with respect to a facility  the anticipated changes in operating costs over the term of the contract  and our ability to increase a facility s contract revenue 
under take or pay contracts  such as the contract relating to moshannon valley correctional center  operating margins are typically higher during the early stages of the contract as the facility s population ramps up as revenues are received at contract percentages regardless of actual occupancy 
as the variable costs primarily resident related and certain facility costs increase with the growth in population  operating margins will generally decline to a stabilized level 
following its activation in april  we experienced such margin impact pertaining to our moshannon valley correctional center in the third and fourth quarters of a decline in occupancy of certain juvenile justice  educational and treatment facilities can have a more significant impact on operating results than the adult secure institutional services division due to higher per diem rates at certain juvenile facilities 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience interim period operating margin fluctuations due to factors such as the number of calendar days in the period  higher payroll taxes in the first half of the year and salary and wage increases and insurance cost increases that are incurred prior to certain contract rate increases 
periodically  many of the governmental agencies with whom we contract may experience budgetary pressures and may approach us to limit or reduce per diem rates 
decreases in  or the lack of anticipated increases in  per diem rates could adversely impact our operating margin 
additionally  a decrease in per diem rates without a corresponding decrease in operating expenses could also adversely affect our operating margin 
we are responsible for all facility operating costs  except for certain debt service and interest or lease payments for facilities where we have a management contract only 
at these facilities  the facility owner is responsible for all debt service and interest or lease payments related to the facility 
we are responsible for all other operating expenses at these facilities 
we operated facilities under management contracts at december   facilities at december  and facilities at december  a majority of our facility operating costs consists of fixed costs 
these fixed costs include lease and rental expense  insurance  utilities and depreciation 
as a result  when we commence operation of new or expanded facilities  fixed operating costs may increase 
the amount of our variable operating costs  including food  medical services  supplies and clothing  depend on occupancy levels at the facilities we operate 
our largest single operating cost  facility payroll expense and related employment taxes and expenses  has both a fixed and a variable component 
we can adjust a facility s staffing levels and the related payroll expense to a certain extent based on occupancy at a facility  however a minimum fixed number of employees is required to operate and maintain any facility regardless of occupancy levels 
personnel costs are subject to increases in tightening labor markets based on local economic environments and other conditions 
we incur pre opening and start up expenses including payroll  benefits  training and other operating costs prior to opening a new or expanded facility and during the period of operation while occupancy is ramping up 
these costs vary by contract 
since pre opening and start up costs are generally factored into the revenue per diem rate that is charged to the contracting agency  we typically expect to recover these upfront costs over the life of the contract 
because occupancy rates during a facility s start up phase typically result in capacity under utilization for at least to days  we may incur additional post opening start up costs 
we do not anticipate post opening start up costs at any adult secure facilities operated under any future contracts with the bop which are take or pay contracts  meaning that the bop will pay at least of the contractual monthly revenue once the facility opens  regardless of actual occupancy 
newly opened facilities are staffed according to applicable regulatory or contractual requirements when we begin receiving offenders or clients 
offenders or clients are typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a phased in basis over a one to six month period 
our start up period for new juvenile operations is months from the date we begin recognizing revenue unless break even occupancy levels are achieved before then 
our start up period for new adult operations is nine months from the date we begin recognizing revenue unless break even occupancy levels are achieved before then 
although we typically recover these upfront costs over the life of the contract  quarterly results can be substantially affected by the timing of the commencement of operations as well as the development and construction of new facilities 
working capital requirements generally increase immediately prior to commencing management of a new or expanded facility as we incur start up costs and purchase necessary equipment and supplies before facility management revenue is realized 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for corporate and administrative personnel who provide senior management  legal  finance  accounting  human resources  payroll and information systems  costs of business development and outside professional and consulting fees 
we incurred additional legal and outside professional and consulting fees related to the merger agreement with veritas  discussed in significant events below  during both and the first quarter of management overview demand 
our business is driven generally by demand for incarceration or treatment services  and specifically by demand for private incarceration or treatment services  within our three primary business segments adult secure institutional services  juvenile justice  educational and treatment services  and adult community based corrections and treatment services 
the demand for adult and juvenile corrections and treatment services has generally increased at a steady rate over the past ten years  largely as a result of increasing sentence terms and or mandatory sentences for criminals and as well a greater range of criminal acts  increasing demand for incarceration of illegal aliens and a public recognition of the need to provide services to juveniles that will improve the possibility that they will lead productive lives 
moreover  demand for our services is also affected by the amount of available capacity in the government systems to enable governments to provide the services themselves  as well as desire and ability of these systems to add additional capacity 
recent recommendations by social commentators and various political or governmental representatives suggest that community based corrections of adults should be emphasized in the future as alternatives to traditional incarceration 
among other things  we monitor federal  state and industry communications and statistics relative to trends in prison populations  juvenile justice statistics and initiatives  and developments in alternatives to traditional incarceration or detention of adults for opportunities to expand our scope or delivery of services 
the federal government increasingly is turning to private providers for the incarceration of adults whether they are serving prison sentences  detained as illegal aliens  detained in anticipation of pending judicial administration or transitioning from prison to society 
chief among the federal agencies which use private providers are the bop  ice  and usms 
we provide adult secure and adult community based services to the federal government 
most of the federal involvement in juvenile administration in the federal system is handled via medicare and medicaid assistance to state governments 
although there are circumstances in which we may contract with a federal agency on a sole source basis  the primary means by which we secure a contract with a federal agency is via the rfp bidding process 
from time to time  we contract to provide management services to a local governmental unit who then bids on a federal contract 
states and smaller governmental units remain divided on the issue of private prisons and private provision of juvenile and community based programs  although a majority of states permit private provision for our services 
we anticipate that increasing budget pressure on states and smaller governmental units will cause more states and smaller governmental units to consider utilizing private providers such as us to provide these services on a more economical basis 
although it varies from governmental unit to governmental unit  the primary political forces who typically oppose privatization of prisons are organized labor and religious groups 
private juvenile and community based programs are much more widely accepted and utilized by states and local governmental units than private adult prisons 
many private providers are organized on a not for profit basis  but there are a number of large  for profit providers of juvenile and community based programs 
we monitor opportunities in these segments via our corporate and service line development officials 
many opportunities are not published in any manner and  accordingly  we believe that taking the initiative at the state and local levels is key in developing sole source opportunities 
performance 
we track a number of factors as we monitor financial performance 
chief among them are capacity the number of beds within each business segment s facilities occupancy utilization per diem reimbursement rates operating expenses capacity  commonly expressed in terms of a number of beds  is primarily impacted by the number and size of the facilities we own or lease and the facilities which are not owned or leased but which are operated by us on behalf of a third party owner or lessee 
we view capacity as one of the measures of our development efforts  through which we may increase capacity by adding new projects or by expanding existing projects 
as part of the evaluation of our development efforts  we will assess a whether a given development project was brought into service in accordance with our expectation as to time and expense  and b the number of projects in development or under consideration at the relevant point in time 
in addition to the focus on new projects  capacity will reflect our success in renewing and maintaining existing contracts and facilities 
it will also reflect any closure of programs or facilities due to underutilization or failure to earn an adequate risk adjusted rate of return 
we must also be cognizant of the possibility that state or local budgetary limitations may cause the contractual commitment to a given facility to be reduced or even eliminated  which would require us to either secure an alternate customer or close the operation 
occupancy is typically expressed in terms of percentage of contract capacity utilized 
we look at occupancy to assess the efficacy of both our efforts to market our facilities and our efforts to retain existing customers or contracts 
because revenue varies directly with occupancy  occupancy is a driver of our revenues 
some of our contracts are take or pay  meaning that the agency making use of the facility is obligated to pay for beds even though they are not used 
historically  occupancy percentages in many of our facilities have been high and we are mindful of the need to maintain high occupancy levels 
as new development projects are brought into service  occupancy percentages may decline until the projects reach full utilization 
where we have commitments for utilization before the commencement of operations  occupancy percentages reflect the speed at which a facility achieves full service implementation 
however  we may decide to undertake development projects without written commitments to make full use of a facility 
in these instances  we have performed our own assessment  based on discussions with local government or other potential customer representatives and analysis of other factors  of the demand for services at the facility 
there is no assurance that we will recover our initial investment in these projects 
we will monitor occupancy as a measure of the accuracy of our estimation of the demand for the services of a development facility  and will incorporate this information in future assessments of potential projects 
per diem reimbursement rates are the other key element of our gross revenue and operating margin since per diem contracts represent a majority of our revenues for the year ended december  
per diem rates are a function of negotiation between management and a governmental unit at the inception of a contract or through the rfp process 
actual per diem rates vary dramatically across our business segments  and as well within each business segment depending upon the particular service or program provided 
the initial per diem rates often change during the term of a contract in accordance with a schedule 
the amount of the change can be a fixed amount set forth within the contract  an amount determined by formulas set forth within the contract or an amount determined by negotiations between management and the governmental unit often these negotiations are along the same lines as the original per diem negotiation a review of expenses and approval of an amount to recompense for expenses and assure the potential of an operating profit 
in recent years  as budgetary pressures on governmental units have increased  some of our governmental customers have negotiated relief from formulaic increase provisions within their agreements or have declined to include in their appropriation legislation amounts that would increase the per diem rates payable under the contract needed in some cases to offset operating expense increases 
although we have mitigated a portion of the impact of these developments by negotiating services provided or obtaining commitments for increased volume  we may also take steps primarily in the area of legislative and governmental monitoring and lobbying to try to reduce or avoid these sorts of adverse developments in the future 
we will continue to monitor per diem rates as a measure of negotiation skill  customer service  management and maintenance  political and business astuteness 
we track several different areas of our operating expenses 
foremost among these expenses are employee compensation and benefits and expenses  risk related areas such as general liability  medical and worker s compensation  client inmate costs such as food  clothing and programming costs  financing costs and administrative overhead expenses 
increases or decreases in one or more of these items  such as our experience with rising insurance costs  can have a material effect on our financial performance 
operating expenses are also impacted by decisions to close or terminate a particular program or facility  as occurred during such decisions are based on our assessments of operating results  operating efficiency and risk adjusted returns and are an ongoing part of our portfolio management 
in addition  decisions to restructure employee positions as occurred in will typically increase period costs initially at the time of such actions  but generally reduce post restructuring expense levels 
we are also monitoring the continued costs of complying with the sarbanes oxley act of  both in terms of fees paid to others  such as independent auditors and consultants  as well as internal administrative costs 
we recognize that our operating margins are subject to pressure from a variety of factors  but most notably rising costs and governmental and agency budgetary constraints 
we also believe that successful development of higher margin and low capital projects is key to mitigating such pressure 
for any development projects committed or facility reactivations in progress  until those projects are completed and brought into full service  we will continue to monitor operations and existing customer relationships in an attempt to minimize the duration of start up periods and the related pressure on operating margins 
significant events merger agreement on october   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with the veritas capital fund iii  lp  a delaware limited partnership veritas  cornell holding corp  a delaware corporation parent and cci acquisition corp  a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of parent merger sub  pursuant to which the merger sub would be merged with and into us the merger  with cornell surviving after the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of parent 
our board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement 
in connection with the merger  the parent and certain of our stockholders entered into a voting agreement dated on or about october   whereby such stockholders agreed  among other things  to vote their respective shares of our stock in favor of the merger agreement  the merger and the transactions contemplated thereby 
at a special meeting of our stockholders held on january   the proposed merger agreement was rejected 
under the terms of the merger agreement  because the merger was terminated  we reimbursed million of these costs incurred by veritas  parent and merger sub in connection with the proposed merger in february such costs will be reported in general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of great plains correctional facility we believe that our existing contract with the oklahoma department of corrections ok doc with respect to our great plains correctional facility expired in july despite negotiations with the ok doc beginning early in  we have been unable to agree on terms for a new contract 
as a result  to preserve our rights relative to other business opportunities  in october heda notified ok doc of our intent to terminate the contract 
with our great plains correctional facility  as with all our facilities  we seek to maximize the operating potential based on an assessment of which potential customer s would enable us to realize the highest economic value 
to date we do not have an alternate customer for this facility  which generated revenues of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our inability to obtain a new customer for this facility could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
cornell abraxas academy formerly the new morgan academy we closed the cornell abraxas academy formerly the new morgan academy in the fourth quarter of and considered several options ranging from the utilization of the facility for another type of program or the sale or lease of the facility 
in we began focusing our efforts on reactivating the facility under a new program 
we reactivated this facility in october as a residential treatment center for youth sex offenders 
we recognized pre tax costs of million  million and million including an impairment charge of million in as discussed below in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for the years ended december   and  respectively  for related holding costs depreciation  interest  property  taxes and other maintenance costs 
the expenses for the period increased in conjunction with the reactivation of the facility in october in december  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to this facility as it was determined  pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 that the carrying amount of the facility was not fully recoverable and exceeded its fair value as based on the most current estimates of cash flows 
as of december   we believe that  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no

january  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenues are derived from contracts with federal  state and local governmental agencies which pay either per diem rates based upon the number of occupant days or hours served for the period  on a take or pay basis  management fee basis  cost plus reimbursement or fee for service basis 
we recognize revenue when we determine that the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occured or services have been rendered  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to the governmental agencies contracted with and other parties in the normal course of business 
we regularly review our outstanding receivables and historical collection experience and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we make judgments regarding our customers ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may occur 
if  after reasonable collection efforts have been made  a receivable is determined to be permanently uncollectible  it is written off 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retention under self insurance programs 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for these losses through insurance reserves 
these reserves are influenced by rising costs of health care and other costs  increases in claims  time lags in claims information and levels of insurance coverage carried 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available to us  adjustments to the related loss reserves may occur 
our reserves for medical and worker s compensation claims are subject to change based on our estimate of the number and the magnitude of claims to be incurred 
based on the risks discussed above  it is necessary for us to estimate the level of our liability related to insurance and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to self insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of self insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
our reserves are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses 
loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims 
these loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
as the determination of our liability for self insured claims is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  and such liabilities could be material in nature  management believes that accounting estimates related to self insurance reserves are critical 
for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to estimate insurance reserves 
for purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis  if the december  reserves for insurance were adjusted increased or decreased by  operating expenses would have changed by approximately million  or 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment at least annually or when changes in circumstances or a triggering event indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets to be held and used be reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value 
assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs 
we estimate fair value based upon the best information available  which may include expected future discounted cash flows to be produced by the asset and or available market prices 
factors that significantly influence estimated future discounted cash flows include the periods and levels of occupancy for the facility  expected per diem or reimbursement rates  assumptions regarding the levels of staffing  services and future operating and capital expenditures necessary to generate forecasted revenues  related costs for these activities and future rate of increases or decreases associated with these factors 
we also consider the results of any appraisals on the properties when assessing fair value 
these estimates are highly subjective  particularly in circumstances where there is no current operating contract in place and changes in the assumptions and estimates could result in the recognition of impairment charges 
the most subjective estimates made in this analysis for and relate to the cornell abraxas academy and the hector garza residential treatment center and for relate to the cornell abraxas academy  the residential school and the maple creek home 
we may be required to record an impairment charge in the future if we are unable to successfully negotiate a replacement contract on any of our facilities for which we currently have an operating contract 
given the nature of the evaluation of future cash flows and the application to specific assets and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
share based compensation we have typically compensated our officers  directors and key employees through the awarding of stock based awards 
based on the requirements of sfas r  which we adopted on january   we account for stock based awards in using a fair value based method  resulting in compensation expense for stock option awards being recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation an amendment to fas  we are currently required to disclose the effect on our net income loss and earnings loss per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to the periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations  or the years ended december  and this tabular disclosure is included in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and any expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
as the determination of these various assumptions is subject to significant management judgment and different assumptions could result in material differences in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of and in our disclosure presented in the footnotes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and  management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of stock options are critical 
the assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of our stock options are based on historical and expected performance of our common shares in the open market  expectations with regard to the pattern with which our employees will exercise their options and the likelihood that dividends  if any  will be paid to holders of our common shares 
for the years ended december    and  no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to determine the assumptions used in these calculations 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which states that there is no amortization of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives 
impairment of these assets is assessed annually to determine if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the net carrying value of the reporting unit  including the applicable goodwill 
the estimates of fair value are based upon our estimates of the present value of future cash flows 
we make assumptions regarding the estimated cash flows and if these estimates or their related assumptions change  an impairment charge may be incurred 
given the nature of the evaluation of future cash flows and the application to specific assets and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
results of operations material fluctuations in our results of operations are principally the result of the level of new contract development activity  the timing and effect of facility expansions  occupancy or contract rates  contract renewals or terminations and facility closures and non recurring charges 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentages of revenue represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss

disclosures excluding the effect of pre opening and start up expenses and revenues represent measures calculated in a manner that is not consistent with gaap 
we believe the exclusion of the non recurring effect of pre opening and start up expenses and revenues increases the reader s understanding of our operating trends
