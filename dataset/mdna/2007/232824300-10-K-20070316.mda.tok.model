overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to advancing the treatment and care of cancer patients by building  developing  and commercializing a portfolio of oncology products for underserved markets where there are unmet needs 
our product portfolio includes four oncology products approved by the fda  caphosol  quadramet  prostascint  and soltamox  which are marketed solely by our specialized sales force to the us oncology market 
we introduced our fourth product  caphosol  in the first quarter of caphosol is an electrolyte solution for the treatment of oral mucositis and dry mouth that was approved as a prescription medical device 
quadramet is approved for the treatment of pain in patients whose cancer has spread to the bone 
soltamox  which we introduced in the second half of  is the first liquid hormonal therapy approved in the us for the treatment of breast cancer in adjuvant and metastatic settings 
prostascint is a psma targeting monoclonal antibody based agent to image the extent and spread of prostate cancer 
currently  our clinical development initiatives are focused on new indications for quadramet and prostascint  as well our product candidate  cyt  a radiolabeled antibody in phase development for the treatment of prostate cancer 
significant events in cytogen announces that fda clears ind for cyt  a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer on may   we announced that the us food and drug administration cleared an investigational new drug application for cyt  our lead therapeutic candidate targeting psma 
we expect to begin the first us phase clinical trial of cyt in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer  subject to institutional review board irb approval at the planned clinical site 
cyt uses the same monoclonal antibody from our prostascint molecular imaging agent  but is linked through a higher affinity linker than is used for prostascint to a therapeutic as opposed to an imaging radionuclide 
this novel product candidate is designed to enable targeted delivery of a cytotoxic agent to psma expressing cells 

table of contents we retain full and exclusive development rights to cyt in february  we announced the initiation of the first human clinical study of cyt cytogen sells ownership in psma development joint venture to progenics on april   we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with progenics providing for the sale to progenics of our ownership interest in pdc  our joint venture with progenics for the development of in vivo cancer immunotherapies based on psma 
in addition  we entered into an amended and restated psma psmp license agreement with progenics and pdc pursuant to which we licensed pdc certain rights in psma technology 
under the terms of such agreements  we sold our interest in pdc for a cash payment of million  potential future milestone payments totaling up to million payable upon regulatory approval and commercialization of pdc products  and royalties on future pdc product sales  if any 
we are no longer responsible for funding pdc 
cytogen and rosemont execute marketing agreement for soltamox on april   we entered into a distribution agreement with savient granting us exclusive marketing rights for soltamox in the united states 
soltamox  a cytostatic estrogen receptor antagonist  is the first oral liquid hormonal therapy approved in the us it is indicated for the treatment of breast cancer in adjuvant and metastatic settings and to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women with ductal carcinoma in situ dcis or with high risk of breast cancer 
in addition  we entered into a supply agreement with savient and rosemont  previously a wholly owned subsidiary of savient  for the manufacture and supply of soltamox 
cytogen s agreements with savient were subsequently assigned by savient to rosemont 
under the terms of the final transaction  we paid savient an up front licensing fee of million and may pay additional contingent sales based payments of up to a total of million to rosemont 
we are also required to pay rosemont royalties on net sales of soltamox 
we introduced soltamox to the us oncology market in the second half of cytogen enters into purchase and supply agreement with oncology therapeutics network on june   we entered into a purchase and supply agreement with oncology therapeutics network appointing otn as the exclusive distributor of soltamox in the united states 
in august  the agreement was amended to revise certain terms  including changing the role of otn to the exclusive warehousing agent and non exclusive distributor of soltamox 
under the terms of the amended agreement  otn will purchase soltamox from us for its own wholesaler channels and  along with third party logistics providers  distribute soltamox to our other customers through its warehousing and distribution facilities 
in january  the agreement was further amended for otn to also distribute caphosol 
cytogen and inpharma execute license agreement for caphosol on october   we entered into a license agreement with inpharma granting us exclusive rights for caphosol in north america

table of contents care in treating oral mucositis caused by radiation or high dose chemotherapy 
caphosol is also indicated for dryness of the mouth or dryness of the throat regardless of the cause or whether the conditions are temporary or permanent 
under the terms of the agreement  we are obligated to pay inpharma million in aggregate up front fees  of which million was paid upon the execution of the agreement   will be paid into an escrow account  and million will be paid after six months 
in addition  inpharma is eligible to receive royalties and sales based milestone payments 
in addition  we are obligated to pay a finder s fee based on a percentage of milestone payments made to inpharma 
the transaction also provides us with options to acquire the rights to caphosol for the european and asian markets that we only intend to exercise in connection with obtaining a commercial partner for those areas 
we will be required to obtain consents from certain licensors but not inpharma  if we sublicense the rights to market caphosol in europe and asia to other parties 
in the event we exercise the options to license marketing rights for caphosol for the european and asia markets  we would be obligated to pay additional fees  including sales based milestone payments for the respective territories 
we introduced caphosol in the us in the first quarter of sale of common stock and warrants on november   we sold to certain institutional investors  shares of our common stock and  warrants to purchase shares of our common stock

if quadramet or prostascint does not achieve broader market acceptance  either because we fail to effectively market such products or our competitors introduce competing products  and if we fail to successfully market soltamox and caphosol  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable 
prostascint 
prostascint sales were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of sales of prostascint accounted for and of product revenues for and  respectively 
the increase from the prior year period was due to the implementation of a price increase for prostascint on september  and increased demand associated with our focused marketing programs 
we believe recent developments in imaging resolution  emerging clinical data  and an increasing level of recognition of the value of prostascint fusion imaging support an important near and long term market opportunity for prostascint 
we are focusing on multiple key areas to position prostascint for future growth and market penetration  including i positioning prostascint fusion imaging as the standard of care for prostate cancer imaging  ii generating awareness of the prognostic value of the psma antigen  iii leveraging the publication and presentation of outcomes data  iv advancing image guided applications including brachytherapy  intensity modulated radiation therapy  surgery  and cryotherapy  and v evaluating the potential for imaging other psma expressing cancers

under the terms of our agreement  we are obligated to pay at least million annually  subject to future annual price adjustment  through  unless terminated by bmsmi or us on a two year prior written notice 
this agreement will automatically renew for five successive one year periods unless terminated by bmsmi or us on a two year prior written notice 
accordingly  we have not included commitments beyond december  we acquired an exclusive license from dow for quadramet for the treatment of osteoblastic bone metastases in certain territories 
the agreement requires us to pay dow royalties based on a percentage of net sales of quadramet  or a guaranteed contractual minimum payment  whichever is greater  and future payments upon achievement of certain milestones 
future annual minimum royalties due to dow are million per year in through and  in in addition to the above  we are obligated to make certain royalty payments based on sales of the related product and certain milestone payments if our collaborative partners achieve specific development milestones or commercial milestones 
we are also obligated to pay a finder s fee based upon a percentage of milestone payments made to inpharma in connection with the licensing of caphosol 
we did not include in the table above any payments that do 
table of contents not represent fixed or minimum payments but are instead payable only upon the achievement of a milestone  if the achievement of that milestone is uncertain or the obligation amount is not determinable 
liquidity and capital resources condensed statement of cash flows all amounts in thousands net loss adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents were million as of december   compared to million as of december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents from the december  balance was primarily due to the sale of our interest in pdc for a cash payment of million in april and the termination of our funding obligations related to the joint venture  and the november sale of common stock and warrants which provided net proceeds of million  partially offset by net cash paid for the acquisition of the product rights to soltamox and caphosol and increased operating expenditures in  including costs to launch soltamox and to promote and support our oncology products  new clinical development initiatives for both quadramet and prostascint and pre clinical development programs associated with the e antibody 
during and  net cash used for operating activities was million and million  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to the increase in and timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
historically  our primary sources of cash have been proceeds from the issuance and sale of our stock through public offerings and private placements  product revenues  revenues from contract research services  fees paid under license agreements  sale of assets  and interest earned on cash and short term investments 
our long term financial objectives are to meet our capital and operating requirements through revenues from existing products and licensing arrangements 
to achieve these objectives  we may enter into research and development partnerships and acquire  in license and develop other technologies  products or services 
certain of these strategies may require 
table of contents payments by us in either cash or stock in addition to the costs associated with developing and marketing a product or technology 
however  we believe that  if successful  such strategies may increase long term revenues 
we cannot assure you of the success of such strategies or that resulting funds will be sufficient to meet cash requirements until product revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses  if ever 
to fund these strategic and operating activities  we may sell equity  debt or other securities as market conditions permit or enter into credit facilities 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to implement our planned product development efforts  including acquisition of products and complementary technologies  research and development  clinical studies and regulatory activities  and to further our marketing and sales programs 
we expect that our existing capital resources at december   along with the receipt of the million settlement from advanced magnetics  inc in the first quarter of should be adequate to fund our operations and commitments at least into we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we expect that we will have additional requirements for debt or equity capital  irrespective of whether and when we reach profitability  for further product development costs  product and technology acquisition costs  and working capital 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including i the successful commercialization of our products  ii the costs associated with the acquisition of complementary products and technologies  iii progress in our product development efforts and the magnitude and scope of such efforts  iv progress with clinical trials  v progress with regulatory affairs activities  vi the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  vii competing technological and market developments  and viii the expansion of strategic alliances for the sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of our products 
to the extent that the currently available funds and revenues are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
we cannot assure you that the financial sources described above will be available when needed or at terms commercially acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  further scale back or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected

critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from product sales and license and contract revenues 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
together  sab  and fasb statement no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas 
sab states that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sfas states that revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product shall be recognized at the time of sale only if the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid the seller  or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the 
table of contents buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
product sales we recognize revenues for product sales at the time title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer  and the other criteria of sab and sfas are satisfied  which is generally at the time products are shipped to customers 
at the time gross revenue is recognized from product sales  an adjustment  or decrease  to revenue for estimated rebates  discounts and returns is also recorded 
this revenue reserve is determined on a product by product basis 
the rebate or discount reserve is recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer eitf  which states that cash consideration given by a vendor to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement 
at the time product is shipped  an adjustment is recorded for estimated rebates and discounts based on the contractual terms with customers 
revenue reserves including return allowances are established by management as its best estimate at the time of sale based on each product s historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
in the case of new product like soltamox which we introduced in the second half of  product shipments made to wholesalers do not meet the revenue recognition criteria of sfas and sab since we cannot reliably estimate expected returns for this new product  we will defer recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until we develop sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns 
in  approximately million of soltamox was shipped to wholesalers 
for these product shipments  we invoice the wholesalers  record the payment received as customer liability  and classify the inventory shipped to wholesalers as inventory at wholesalers at the company s cost of goods for such inventory 
we recognize revenue for soltamox when such product is sold through to the end users  on a first in first out fifo basis 
additionally  royalty amount due based on unit shipments to wholesalers is deferred and recognized as royalty expense as those units are sold through and recognized as revenue 
we have the right to offset royalties paid for product that are later returned against subsequent royalty obligations 
costs related to shipments of soltamox  for which we do not have the ability to recover if and when products are returned  are expensed as incurred 
when available  we may use the following information to estimate the prescription based sales for soltamox and to estimate gross to net sales adjustments the estimated prescription based sales  our analysis of third party information  including information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to customers and third party market research data  and our internal product sales information 
our estimates will be subject to the inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third party data  as certain third party information is itself in the form of estimates  and has other limitations 
our 
table of contents sales and revenue recognition for soltamox will reflect our estimates of actual product sold through to the end user 
provisions for estimated reductions to gross sales at the time product sales are made  we reduce gross sales through accruals for product returns  rebates and volume discounts 
we account for these reductions in accordance with eitf and sfas  as applicable 
returns quadramet is a radioactive product that is indicated for the relief of pain due to metastatic bone disease arising from various types of cancer 
due to its rapid rate of radioactive decay  quadramet has a shelf life of only about hours 
for this reason  quadramet is ordered for a specific patient on a pre scheduled visit  and  as such  our customers are unable to maintain stock inventories of this product 
in addition  because the product is ordered for pre scheduled visits for specific patients  product returns are very low 
our methodology to estimate sales returns is based on historical experience that demonstrates that the vast majority of the returns occur within one month of when product was shipped 
at the time of sale  we estimate the quantity and value of quadramet that may ultimately be returned 
we generally have the exact number of returns related to prior month sales in the current month  so the provision for returns is trued up to actual quickly 
we do not allow product returns for prostascint 
returns from new product  like soltamox  are more difficult to assess 
since we have no historical return experience with soltamox  we cannot reliably estimate expected returns of this new product 
therefore  we will defer recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until we have developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns 
we may use information from external sources to estimate our return provisions 
volume discounts we provide volume discounts to certain customers based on sales levels of given products during each calendar month 
we recognize revenue net of these volume discounts at the end of each month 
there are no volume discounts based on cumulative sales over more than a one month period 
accordingly  there is no current need to estimate volume discounts 
rebates from time to time  we may offer rebates to our customers 
we establish a rebate accrual based on the specific terms in each agreement  in an amount equal to our reasonable estimate of the expected rebate claims attributable to the sales in the current period and adjust the accrual each reporting period to reflect the actual experience 
if the amount of future rebates cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability will be recognized for the maximum potential amount of the rebates 

table of contents license and contract revenues include milestone payments and fees under collaborative agreements with third parties  revenues from research services  and revenues from other miscellaneous sources 
we defer non refundable up front license fees and recognize them over the estimated performance period of the related agreement  when we have continuing involvement 
since the term of the performance periods is subject to management s estimates  future revenues to be recognized could be affected by changes in such estimates 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances are net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust our allowance for uncollectible accounts if the future bad debt expense exceeds our estimated reserve 
we are subject to concentration risks as a limited number of our customers provide a high percent of total revenues  and corresponding receivables 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  as determined using the first in  first out method  which most closely reflects the physical flow of our inventories 
our products and raw materials are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly review quantities on hand to determine the need to write down inventory for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of product sales 
our estimate of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
carrying value of fixed and intangible assets our fixed assets and certain of our acquired rights to market our products have been recorded at cost and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
we also acquired an option to purchase marketing rights to caphosol in europe which was recorded as other assets and will transfer the costs to the appropriate asset account if exercised 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
regarding the option to purchase marketing rights to caphosol in europe  we also assess our intent and ability to exercise the option  the option expiry date and market and product competitiveness 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
adverse changes regarding future cash flows to be received from long lived assets could indicate that an impairment exists  and would require the write down of the carrying value of the impaired asset at that time 

table of contents warrant liabilities we follow emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock which provides guidance for distinguishing between permanent equity  temporary equity and assets and liabilities 
under eitf  to qualify as permanent equity  the equity derivative must permit us to settle in unregistered shares 
we do not have that ability under the securities purchase agreement for the warrants issued in july and august and  as eitf considers the ability to keep a registration statement effective as beyond our control  the warrants cannot be classified as permanent equity and are instead classified as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our warrants issued in november which permit net cash settlement at the option of the warrant holders also require classification as a liability in accordance with eitf we record the warrant liability at its fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and remeasure it at each reporting date until the warrants are exercised or expire 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as non operating income or expense 
the fair value of the warrants is subject to significant fluctuation based on changes in our stock price  expected volatility  expected life  the risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
consequently  future fluctuations in the price of our common stock may cause significant increases or decreases in the fair value of the warrants issued 
we follow eitf no 
accounting for registration payment arrangement which specifies that registration payment arrangements should play no part in determining the initial classification and subsequent accounting for the securities they related to 
the staff position requires the contingent obligation in a registration payment arrangement to be separately analyzed under fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies and fasb interpretation no 
 reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss 
consequently  if payment in a registration payment arrangement in connection with the warrants issued in november is probable and can be reasonably estimated  a liability will be recorded 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provision of this statement  the share based compensation  which is generally based on the fair value of the awards calculated using the black scholes option pricing model on the date of grant  is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  generally the vesting period  for grants on or after january  for nonvested shares  we use the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividend yield  expected forfeiture rates  expected volatility  the expected term and expected risk free interest rates 
if we were to use different estimates or a different valuation model  our share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements accounting for registration payment arrangements on december   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements eitf  which addresses an issuer s accounting for registration payment arrangements 
eitf specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement  whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement  should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
eitf further clarifies that a financial instrument subject to a registration payment arrangement should be accounted for in accordance with other applicable accounting literature without regard to the contingent obligation to transfer consideration pursuant to the registration arrangement 
eitf is effective immediately for new and modified registration payment arrangements 
early adoption of eitf for the interim or annual period for which the financials statements have not been issued is permitted

this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin upon our financial statements and related disclosures

sales tax in march  the fasb s emerging issues task force released issue  how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement eitf 
a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of presenting sales taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis 
if taxes are significant  an entity should disclose its policy of presenting taxes and the amount of taxes if reflected on a gross basis in the income statement 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  we present sales net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations and do not anticipate changing our policy as a result of eitf abnormal inventory costs in november  the fasb issued sfas no

 to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  we adopted sfas no 
in our fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our consolidated statement of operations in the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations 
our exposure to market risk is principally confined to interest rate sensitivity 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are conservative in nature  with a focus on preservation of capital 
due to the short term nature of our investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments are not material to our business 
we are exposed to certain risks arising from changes in the price of our common stock  primarily due to the potential effect of changes in fair value of the warrant liability related to the warrants issued in and the warrant liability is measured at fair value using the black scholes option pricing model at each reporting date and is subject to significant increases
