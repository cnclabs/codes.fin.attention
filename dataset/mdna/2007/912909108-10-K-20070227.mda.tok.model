raw materials and energy historically  supplies of raw materials and energy used to produce steel have been more than sufficient and costs were relatively stable 
in the past several years there has been a tightening of raw material availability and substantial increases in costs 
as an integrated producer  u 
s 
steel s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore or taconite  carbon units in the form of coal and coke which is produced from coal and steel scrap 
the amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products  the quality of raw materials and  to a lesser extent  differences among steel producing equipment 
in broad terms  u 
s 
steel estimates that it consumes about tons of coal to produce one ton of coke and that it consumes over tons of iron ore pellets and a little less than tons of coke for each ton of raw steel produced 
while we believe that these estimates are useful for planning purposes  substantial variations occur 
they are presented in order to give a general sense of raw material consumption related to steel production 
iron ore logo with the iron ore facilities at minntac and keetac  which contain an estimated million short tons of recoverable reserves  u 
s 
steel has the capability of being completely self sufficient for iron ore requirements to support blast furnace production in the us recoverable tons means the tons of product that can be used internally or delivered to a customer after considering mining and beneficiation or preparation losses 
any surplus pellet production is sold to domestic and foreign consumers  including usse 
depending on market conditions and transportation costs  internal iron ore requirements may be satisfied by the purchase of pellets from third parties  permitting the sale of additional pellets on the open market 
usse purchases most of its iron ore requirements from third parties  but has also purchased iron ore from u 
s 
steel s iron ore facilities in the us we believe that supplies of iron ore  adequate to meet usse s needs  are available at competitive market prices 
the main sources of iron ore for usse are russia and ukraine  with supplemental supplies coming from slovakia  venezuela and brazil 

table of contents coal all of u 
s 
steel s coal requirements in the us are purchased from third parties 
we believe that supplies of coal adequate to meet our domestic needs are available from third parties at competitive market prices 
coal supplies were disrupted throughout largely due to the declarations of force majeure by several of u 
s 
steel s major coal suppliers  and in early due to river lock closures resulting from flooding 
u 
s 
steel has entered into contracts at competitive market prices for our domestic coal requirements in ussk s coal requirements are purchased from third parties 
we believe that supplies of coal adequate to meet ussk s needs are available from third parties at competitive market prices 
the main sources of coal for ussk include poland  the czech republic  the united states  russia and ukraine 
ussk has entered into contracts at competitive market prices for its coal requirements in ussb  which purchases coke  does not currently require coal to support its operations 
coke logo in the us  u 
s 
steel operates cokemaking facilities at our clairton  pennsylvania  gary  indiana  and granite city  illinois locations 
these facilities have the capability to supply the majority of u 
s 
steel s metallurgical coke requirements for blast furnace production in the us blast furnace coal injection processes at gary works  great lakes works and fairfield works reduce u 
s 
steel s domestic coke requirements 
we routinely sell or swap a portion of the coke production from our clairton facility 
to the extent that it is necessary or appropriate considering existing needs and or applicable transportation costs  coke is purchased from or swapped with us and international suppliers or other end users 
we are evaluating alternatives to add cokemaking facilities and to enhance energy recoveries 
ussk operates a cokemaking facility that primarily serves the steelmaking operations at ussk 
depending on market conditions and operational schedules  ussk may purchase coke on the open market and may occasionally supply a portion of ussb s needs 
blast furnace coal injection processes at ussk reduce its coke requirements 
ussb sources substantially all of its coke requirements from third party suppliers 
we believe that supplies of coke  adequate to meet ussk s and ussb s needs  are available at competitive market prices 
the main sources of coke for ussk and ussb in are expected to be poland  ukraine  russia  bosnia  hungary  china and the czech republic 
limestone all limestone requirements in the us are purchased from third parties 
we believe that supplies of limestone adequate to meet our domestic needs are readily available from third parties at competitive market prices 
all limestone requirements for ussk are purchased from a third party under a long term contract 
we source approximately percent of ussb s limestone requirements from third party suppliers with the balance coming from a limestone mine under our direct control 
we believe that supplies of limestone adequate to meet ussb s needs are available from third parties at competitive market prices 
zinc and tin we believe that supplies of zinc and tin required to fulfill our requirements for us and european operations are available from third parties at competitive market prices 

table of contents scrap and other materials we believe that supplies of steel scrap and other alloying and coating materials required to fulfill our requirements for us and european operations are available from third parties at competitive market prices 
generally  approximately percent of our scrap requirements is internally generated through normal operations 
natural gas logo we purchase all of our natural gas requirements from third parties 
we believe that supplies of natural gas adequate to meet our us needs are available from third parties at competitive market prices 
about percent of our domestic natural gas purchases are based on solicited bids  on a monthly basis  from various vendors  approximately percent are made through long term contracts  and the remainder are made daily or with physical forward positions 
we have executed physical forward positions consistent with anticipated domestic business needs for natural gas because of the volatility of natural gas markets 
as shown in the graph  domestic natural gas prices have increased significantly over the last several years 
we believe that supplies of natural gas  adequate to meet usse s needs  are normally available from third parties at competitive market prices 
natural gas prices in slovakia and serbia have been less volatile than in the us  however  prices increased in and and are expected to increase again in we experienced curtailments of natural gas supplies at ussb in early serbia relies upon a single pipeline system for its natural gas  making ussb and other industrial customers in serbia vulnerable to disruptions in this system 
commercial sales of product u 
s 
steel characterizes our sales as contract if sold pursuant to an agreement with defined pricing and a one year or longer duration  and as spot if sold pursuant to a shorter term contract 
in approximately percent  percent and percent of sales by flat rolled  usse and tubular  respectively  were contract sales 
u 
s 
steel does not consider sales backlog to be a meaningful measure since volume commitments in most contracts are based on each customer s specific monthly orders 
environmental matters u 
s 
steel maintains a comprehensive environmental policy overseen by the corporate governance and public policy committee of the u 
s 
steel board of directors 
the environmental affairs organization has the responsibility to ensure that u 
s 
steel s operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
the executive environmental committee  which is comprised of officers of u 
s 
steel  is charged with reviewing our overall performance with various environmental compliance programs 
also  u 
s 
steel  largely through the american iron and steel institute and the international iron and steel institute  is involved in the development of various air  water and waste regulations with federal  state and local governments and international stakeholders concerning the implementation of cost effective environmental strategies 
u 
s 
steel s businesses in the us are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act caa 
table of contents with respect to air emissions  the clean water act cwa with respect to water discharges  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances 
in addition  all states where u 
s 
steel operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters 
these laws are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for laws such as rcra and the caa have not yet been promulgated and in certain instances are undergoing revision 
these environmental laws and regulations  particularly the caa  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet caa obligations and similar obligations in europe  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that our major domestic and many european integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills  some foreign steel producers and producers of materials which compete with steel  all of which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to our prior disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
most of our competitors have fewer historic liabilities 
ussk is subject to the environmental laws of slovakia and the european union eu 
the environmental requirements of slovakia and the eu are comparable to environmental standards in the us there are no legal proceedings pending against ussk involving environmental matters 
ussk has a current compliance project for a primary dedusting system at steel shop no 
to meet air emission standards for particulates 
the slovak government has established november  as a new deadline for ussk to meet compliance standards at steel shop no 
 and ussk anticipates meeting these standards prior to the deadline 
while the united states has not ratified the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  the european commission ec establishes its own co 

limits for every eu member state 
in  the ec approved a national allocation plan nap i for slovakia that reduced slovakia s originally proposed co allocation by approximately percent  and following that decision the slovak ministry of the environment ministry imposed an percent reduction to the amount of co allowances originally requested by ussk 
subsequently  ussk filed legal actions against the ec and the ministry challenging these reductions 
ussk is purchasing co allowances needed to cover its anticipated shortfall for the nap i allocation period through 
based on the value of purchased credits and current market value of co allowances remaining to be purchased for the anticipated shortfall related to production through december   a long term other liability of million was recognized on the balance sheet as of december  on november   the ec issued a decision that slovakia would be granted percent fewer co allowances than were requested in slovakia s nap ii  for the allocation period through both slovakia and ussk have filed legal actions against the ec to challenge this decision 
the ministry has not yet allocated slovakia s co allowances to companies within slovakia for the nap ii period 
the potential financial and or operational impacts of nap ii are not currently determinable 
while ratification of the kyoto protocol in the us has not occurred  there remains the possibility that limitations on greenhouse gases may be imposed 
the impact on our domestic operations cannot be estimated at this time 
ussb is subject to the environmental laws of serbia 
these laws are currently less restrictive than either the eu or us standards  but this is expected to change over the next several years in anticipation of possible eu accession 
under the terms of the acquisition  ussb will be responsible for only those costs and liabilities associated with environmental events occurring subsequent to the completion of an environmental baseline study 
the study was completed in june and submitted to the government of serbia

risk factors risk factors concerning the steel industry steel consumption is cyclical and worldwide overcapacity in the steel industry and the availability of alternative products have resulted in intense competition  which may have an adverse effect on profitability and cash flow 
steel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows general economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in various smaller geographic areas 
the steel industry has historically been characterized by excess world supply  which has led to substantial price decreases during periods of economic weakness 
future economic downturns could decrease the demand for our products 
substitute materials are increasingly available for many steel products  which further reduces demand for steel 
rapidly growing supply in china and other developing economies  which may increase faster than increases in demand  may result in additional excess worldwide capacity and falling steel prices 
over the last several years  steel consumption in china and other developing economies has increased at a rapid pace 
steel companies have responded by developing plans to rapidly increase steel production capability in these countries 
steel production  especially in china  has been expanding rapidly and appears to be well in excess of chinese demand 
because china is now the largest worldwide steel producer by a significant margin  any significant excess chinese capacity could have a major impact on world steel trade and prices if this excess production is exported to other markets 
increased imports of steel products into the us could negatively affect domestic steel prices and demand levels and reduce profitability of domestic producers 
steel imports to the united states accounted for an estimated percent of the domestic steel market in  percent in and percent in foreign competitors may have lower labor costs  and some are owned  controlled or subsidized by their governments  which allows their production and pricing decisions to be influenced by political and economic policy considerations as well as prevailing market conditions 
increases in future levels of imported steel could reduce future market prices and demand levels for domestic steel 
the recent expiration of a number of antidumping and countervailing duty orders may facilitate additional imports 
several more antidumping and countervailing duty orders applicable to steel products are currently under review by the relevant government agencies 
expiration of these orders could result in even greater import levels 
increases in prices and limited availability of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 
steel producers require large amounts of raw materials iron ore or other iron containing material  steel scrap  coke  coal and zinc for integrated producers such as u 
s 
steel  and scrap and zinc for mini mill producers 
both integrated and mini mill producers consume large amounts of energy 
over the last several years  prices for raw materials and energy  in particular natural gas and zinc  have increased significantly 
in many cases these price increases have been a greater percentage than price increases for the sale of steel products 
u 
s 
steel and other steel producers have periodically been faced with problems in obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner  resulting in production curtailments 
ussb is dependent upon availability of natural gas in serbia  which is dependent upon a single pipeline 
serbia has experienced major curtailments during periods of peak demand in eastern europe and russia 
these production curtailments and escalated costs have reduced profit margins and may continue to do so in the future 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 
steel producers in the us are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent 
the 
table of contents ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
environmental laws and regulations  particularly the clean air act  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
international environmental requirements vary 
while standards in the european union eu and japan are generally comparable to us standards  other nations have substantially lesser requirements that may give competitors in such nations a competitive advantage 
unplanned equipment outages and other unforeseen disruptions may reduce our results of operations 
our steel production depends on the operation of critical pieces of equipment  such as blast furnaces  casters and hot strip mills 
it is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to equipment failures at our facilities or those of our key suppliers 
it is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages  explosions  fires  floods  accidents and severe weather conditions 
availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions such as shortages of barges  rail cars or trucks 
to the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage  our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected 
risk factors concerning u 
s 
steel legacy obligations many lawsuits have been filed against u 
s 
steel involving asbestos related injuries  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is a defendant in a large number of cases in which approximately  claimants actively allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
it is possible that we may experience large judgments against us in the future that could have an impact upon the number of future claims filed against us and on the amount of future settlements  which would have an adverse impact on our profitability and cash flow 
our retiree employee health care and retiree life insurance plan costs  most of which are unfunded obligations  and our pension plan costs in the us are higher than those of many of our competitors 
these plans create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
we maintain defined benefit retiree health care and life insurance and defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans covering most of our us employees and former employees upon their retirement 
as of december   approximately  current employees  retirees and beneficiaries are participating in the plans to receive pension and or medical benefits 
u 
s 
steel s underfunded benefit obligations for retiree medical and life insurance other benefits were billion at year end most of our other benefits and pension benefits are subject to collective bargaining agreements with unionized workforces and will be subject to future negotiations 
minimum contributions to the main qualified pension plan are controlled under erisa and other government regulations 
substantial cash contributions will be required to fund other benefits and pension benefits 
total costs for pension plans and other benefits are expected to be approximately million in many domestic and international competitors do not provide defined benefit retiree health care and life insurance and pension plans  and other international competitors operate in jurisdictions with government sponsored health care plans that may offer them a cost advantage 
several domestic competitors provide defined contribution health care and pension plans with contributions increased based upon profitability 
this will provide these competitors with a significant competitive advantage during periods of low profits 
u 
s 
steel contributes to a multiemployer plan covering pensions for unionized workers 
we have legal and contractual requirements for future funding of this plan  which will have a negative effect on our cash flows 
in addition  funding requirements for participants could increase as a result of any underfunding of this plan 

table of contents we have higher environmental remediation costs than our competitors 
this creates a competitive disadvantage and negatively affects our profitability and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is currently involved in numerous remediation projects at currently operating facilities  facilities that have been closed or sold to third parties and other sites where material generated by u 
s 
steel was deposited 
in addition  there are numerous other former operating or disposal sites that could become the subject of remediation 
environmental remediation costs and related cash requirements of many of our competitors may be substantially less than ours 
many international competitors do not face similar laws in the jurisdictions where they operate 
numerous us competitors have substantially shorter operating histories than we do  resulting in less exposure for environmental remediation 
us competitors that have obtained relief under the bankruptcy code may have been released from certain environmental obligations that existed prior to the bankruptcy filing 
other risk factors applicable to u 
s 
steel we may be unable to recover cost increases as we supply customers with steel under long term fixed price sales contracts 
historically approximately percent of u 
s 
steel s flat rolled product sales in the united states have been based on sales contracts with durations of at least one year 
these contracts generally have a fixed price or a price that will fluctuate with changes in a defined index 
to the extent that raw materials  energy  labor or other costs increase over the terms of the various contracts  u 
s 
steel may not be able to recover these cost increases from customers with fixed price agreements 
u 
s 
steel currently enters into forward purchases to establish future prices for a portion of our required natural gas and zinc needs  however  we remain at risk for our remaining requirements 
we are also at risk in the event that future prices decline below the prices that the forward purchases have established 
customer payment defaults could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and could experience financial difficulties in times of economic downturn 
in some cases  these difficulties may result in bankruptcy filings or cessation of operations 
if customers experiencing financial problems default on paying amounts owed to us  we may not be able to collect these amounts or recognize expected revenue 
any material payment defaults by our customers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
also  a material payment default could cause a default  or a reduction in the amount of receivables available for sale  under our receivables sale program 
the terms of our indebtedness may restrict our ability to pay dividends 
under the terms of our senior notes due senior notes  we must meet certain restricted payment tests in order to pay dividends or make certain investments 
the terms of our indebtedness contain restrictive provisions that may limit our flexibility 
we have senior notes outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of million as of december  the senior notes impose significant restrictions on us such as limits on additional borrowings and certain investments and the use of funds from asset sales 
our million revolving credit agreement secured by inventory inventory facility prohibits us from selling certain principal properties and imposes additional restrictions if the amount available to be borrowed under that agreement is less than million 
such restrictions include maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio and limitations on capital expenditures and investments 
the senior notes  the revolving credit agreement and some of our other loan facilities and leases have provisions that may cause a default under one of these agreements to become a default under the others 
these covenants may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 

table of contents rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings  which would make it more difficult for us to raise capital and would increase our financial costs 
any downgrade in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult  may increase the cost of future borrowings  may affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services  and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
change in control clauses may require us to immediately purchase or repay debt 
upon the occurrence of change in control events specified in our senior notes  inventory facility and various other contracts and leases  the holders of our indebtedness may require us to immediately purchase or repay that debt on less than favorable terms 
we may not have the financial resources to make these purchases and repayments  and a failure to purchase or repay such indebtedness would trigger cross acceleration clauses under the senior notes and other indebtedness 
we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize 
as of december   u 
s 
steel had net federal  foreign and state deferred tax assets of million 
although management believes that it is more likely than not that future operating results and tax planning strategies generating sufficient future taxable income can be utilized to realize the net deferred tax assets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate such results or implement these strategies 
our international operations expose us to uncertainties and risks from abroad  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
ussk  located in slovakia  and ussb  located in serbia  constitute nearly percent of our total raw steel production capability  and accounted for percent of net sales and percent of income from operations for both ussk and ussb are subject to economic conditions and political factors in europe  which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  currency fluctuations  increased regulation and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures 
ussk and ussb are also subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
any future international acquisitions would expose us to similar risks 
the quantity of carbon dioxide emission allowances awarded by the european commission may limit the amount of steel that can be produced at ussk or force ussk to purchase emissions allowances  negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flow 
the european commission ec has established a carbon dioxide co emission trading scheme for eu member countries 
under this program slovakia has received fewer co emissions allowances than it requested for both the first period through and second period through 
the slovak ministry of the environment  in turn  awarded ussk fewer allowances than ussk had requested for the first period  and is likely to award ussk fewer allowances than requested for the second period 
ussk is purchasing emissions allowances needed to cover its anticipated shortfall for the first period and  as to future periods  we may be required to reduce ussk s production or purchase emission allowances  either of which may have a negative impact on income and cash flow 
see item business environmental matters 
adoption of greenhouse gas policies in the us could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
while ratification of the kyoto protocol in the us has not occurred  there remains the possibility that limitations on greenhouse gases may be imposed 
any such limitations could have a negative effect on income and cash flow 
our business requires substantial expenditures for debt service  contingent obligations  capital investment  operating leases and maintenance that we may be unable to fund 
with  million of debt outstanding as of december   we have significant debt service requirements 

table of contents our operations are capital intensive 
for the five year period ended december   total capital expenditures were billion 
at december   our contract commitments to acquire property  plant and equipment totaled million and we were obligated to make aggregate lease payments of million under operating leases 
in addition to capital expenditures and lease payments  we spend significant amounts for maintenance of raw material  raw steel and steel finishing production facilities  including periodic relines or rebuilds of our seventeen blast furnaces 
as of december   we had contingent obligations consisting of indemnity obligations under active surety bonds  trusts and letters of credit totaling approximately million  guarantees of approximately million of indebtedness for unconsolidated entities and contractual purchase commitments under purchase orders and take or pay arrangements of approximately billion  plus contingencies under the sale of our mining assets of approximately million 
as the general partner of the clairton b partnership  we are obligated to fund cash shortfalls incurred by that partnership but may withdraw as the general partner if we are required to fund in excess of million in operating cash shortfalls 
our business may not generate sufficient operating cash flow  or external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient  to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
we intend indefinitely to reinvest undistributed foreign earnings overseas  however  if we need to repatriate funds in the future to satisfy our liquidity needs  the tax consequences would reduce income and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is exposed to uninsured losses 
u 
s 
steel s insurance coverage against catastrophic casualty and business interruption exposures contains certain common exclusions  substantial deductibles and self insurance retentions 
our collective bargaining agreements may limit our flexibility 
the collective bargaining agreement with the usw contains provisions that prohibit us from pursuing any north american transaction involving steel or steel related assets without the consent of the usw  grants the usw a right to bid on any sale of one or more facilities covered by the collective bargaining agreement  requires us to make reasonable and necessary capital expenditures to maintain the competitive status of our domestic facilities and requires mandatory pre funding of a trust for retiree health care and life insurance based on  among other factors  dividend and pension funding levels 
that agreement also restricts our ability to trade  sell or use foreign produced coke and iron ore in north america  and further requires that the ratio of non usw employees to usw employees at our domestic facilities not exceed one to five 
while other domestic integrated unionized steel producers have similar requirements in their agreements with the usw  some foreign and non union domestic producers are not subject to such requirements 
strikes  work stoppages and customer concern about the possibility of strikes  particularly upon the expiration of our major domestic collective bargaining agreement  could adversely impact our relationships with our customers which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  mini mill producers  certain foreign competitors and producers of comparable products do not have unionized work forces 
this may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
there are risks associated with acquisitions 
the success of any future acquisitions will depend substantially on our ability to integrate the acquired operations successfully with existing operations 
if we are unable to integrate new operations successfully  our financial results and business reputation could suffer 
recent acquisitions in the steel industry have involved prices significantly higher than the prices we paid for our acquisitions in such prices will make it more difficult to achieve adequate financial returns 
additional risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  the possible assumption of unknown liabilities  potential disputes with the sellers  and the 
table of contents inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience 
international acquisitions may present unique challenges and increase the company s exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations 
provisions of delaware law  our governing documents and our rights plan may make a takeover of u 
s 
steel more difficult 
certain provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation and by laws and our rights plan could make more difficult or delay our acquisition by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise and the removal of incumbent directors 
these provisions are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids  even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price 
approximately one third of u 
s 
steel s us based non union workforce will be eligible for retirement in the next five years 
over the last few years we have intensified our recruitment  training and retention efforts so that we may continue to optimally staff our operations 
failure to do so could negatively affect our future performance 
we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning erp system 
we are currently pursuing the potential company wide benefits of implementing an erp system to help us operate more efficiently 
this is a complex project which would occur in several phases over the next several years 
there can be no assurance that we can successfully implement an erp program without experiencing difficulties or that the program will improve our global operations 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that the expected benefits of implementing an erp system will be realized or that realized benefits will outweigh the costs of implementation

steel is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment 
certain of these matters are included below in this discussion 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to the financial statements 
however  management believes that u

asbestos litigation as of december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases involving approximately  plaintiffs claims 
at december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases involving approximately  plaintiffs 
during  settlements and dismissals resulted in the disposition of approximately  claims and u 
s 
steel paid approximately million in settlements 
new filings added approximately claims 
more than  or approximately percent  of these claims are currently pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
of these claims  about  are pending in mississippi and over  are pending in texas 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
mississippi and texas have amended their laws to curtail mass filings 
as a consequence  the approximately claims filed last year name either a single individual or a handful of individuals 
historically  these claims against u 
s 
steel fall into three major groups claims made under certain federal and general maritime laws by employees of the great lakes fleet or intercoastal fleet  former operations of u 
s 
steel  claims made by persons who allegedly were exposed to asbestos at u 
s 
steel facilities referred to as premises claims  and claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to products formerly manufactured by u 
s 
steel 
most claims filed over the last several years have been premises claims 
while u 
s 
steel has excess casualty insurance  these policies have multi million dollar self insured retentions 
to date  u 
s 
steel has not received any payments under these policies relating to asbestos claims 
in most cases  this excess casualty insurance is the only insurance applicable to asbestos claims 
these asbestos cases allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
u 
s 
steel is currently a defendant in cases in which a total of approximately plaintiffs allege that they are suffering from mesothelioma 
the potential for damages against defendants may be greater in cases in which the plaintiffs can prove mesothelioma 
in many such cases in which claims have been asserted against u 
s 
steel  the plaintiffs have been unable to establish any causal relationship to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises 
in addition  in many asbestos cases  the plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any identifiable injury or compensable loss at all  that any injuries that they have incurred did in fact result from alleged exposure to asbestos  or that such alleged exposure was in any way related to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises 

table of contents in every asbestos case in which u 
s 
steel is named as a party  the complaints are filed against numerous named defendants and generally do not contain allegations regarding specific monetary damages sought 
to the extent that any specific amount of damages is sought  the amount applies to claims against all named defendants and in no case is there any allegation of monetary damages against u 
s 
steel 
historically  approximately percent of the cases against u 
s 
steel did not specify any damage amount or stated that the damages sought exceeded the amount required to establish jurisdiction of the court in which the case was filed 
jurisdictional amounts generally range from  to  u 
s 
steel does not consider the amount of damages alleged  if any  in a complaint to be relevant in assessing our potential exposure to asbestos liabilities 
the ultimate outcome of any claim depends upon a myriad of legal and factual issues  including whether the plaintiff can prove actual disease  if any  actual exposure  if any  to u 
s 
steel products  or the duration of exposure to asbestos  if any  on u 
s 
steel s premises 
u 
s 
steel has noted over the years that the form of complaint including its allegations  if any  concerning damages often depends upon the form of complaint filed by particular law firms and attorneys 
often the same damage allegation will be in multiple complaints regardless of the number of plaintiffs  the number of defendants  or any specific diseases or conditions alleged 
u 
s 
steel aggressively pursues grounds for the dismissal of u 
s 
steel from pending cases and litigates cases to verdict where we believe litigation is appropriate 
u 
s 
steel also makes efforts to settle appropriate cases  especially mesothelioma cases  for reasonable  and frequently nominal  amounts 
the following table shows activity with respect to asbestos litigation over the last three years year ended december  opening number of claims claims dismissed  settled and resolved new claims closing number of claims amounts paid to resolve claims in millions the amount u 
s 
steel has accrued for pending asbestos claims is not material to u 
s 
steel s financial position 
u 
s 
steel does not accrue for unasserted asbestos claims because we believe it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable with respect to such claims or even to estimate the amount or range of any possible losses 
among the reasons that u 
s 
steel cannot reasonably estimate the number and nature of claims against us is that the vast majority of pending claims against us allege so called premises liability based exposure on u 
s 
steel s current or former premises 
these claims are made by an indeterminable number of people such as truck drivers  railroad workers  salespersons  contractors and their employees  government inspectors  customers  visitors and even trespassers 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  and although u 
s 
steel s results of operations and cash flows for a given period could be adversely affected by asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are that u 
s 
steel has been subject to a total of approximately  asbestos claims over the past years ended december  that have been administratively dismissed or are inactive due to the failure of the plaintiffs to present any medical evidence supporting their claims  that over the last several years  the total number of pending claims has declined  that it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals  including matters in madison county  illinois  where u 
s 
steel lost a significant verdict in u 
s 
steel has not seen any material differences in subsequent settlements in madison county or elsewhere since that verdict and management believes that the possibility of other such aberrational verdicts is remote  although not impossible 
the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 

table of contents environmental proceedings the following is a summary of the proceedings of u 
s 
steel that were pending or contemplated as of december   under federal and state environmental laws 
except as described herein  it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
cercla remediation sites claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites 
cercla is intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties prps for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
because of various factors including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred  it is impossible to reasonably estimate u 
s 
steel s ultimate cost of compliance with cercla 
projections  provided in the following paragraphs  of spending for and or timing of completion of specific projects are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions including  but not limited to  the factors provided in the preceding paragraph 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future spending for  or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from what was stated in forward looking statements 
at december   u 
s 
steel had been identified as a prp at a total of cercla sites where liability is not resolved 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that u 
s 
steel s liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with of these sites will be between  and million per site  and for eight of these sites will be under  at the remaining site  management estimates u 
s 
steel s share in the future cleanup costs to be million  although it is not possible to accurately predict the amount of final allocation of such costs 
that site is known as the municipal industrial disposal co 
site in elizabeth  pennsylvania 
in october  the pennsylvania department of environmental resources pader placed the site on the pennsylvania state superfund list and began a remedial investigation ri  which was issued in u 
s 
steel and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep signed a consent order and agreement on august   under which u 
s 
steel is responsible for remediation of this site 
in the consent order and agreement became final 
u 
s 
steel is currently completing the remedial design for this site 
in addition  there are sites related to u 
s 
steel where information requests have been received or there are other indications that u 
s 
steel may be a prp under cercla  but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or to make any judgment as to the amount thereof 
other remediation activities there are additional sites where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with nine of these sites will be under  per site  another sites have potential costs between  and million per site  and seven sites may involve remediation costs between million and million 
as described below  costs for remediation  investigation  restoration or compensation are estimated to be in excess of million at two sites  in excess of million at three sites  and in excess of million at one site 
potential costs associated with remediation at the remaining five sites are not presently determinable

overview u 
s 
steel  the sixth largest steel producer in the world and the second largest integrated steel producer in north america  has a broad and diverse mix of products and customers 
u 
s 
steel uses iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc and tin to produce a wide range of steel products  concentrating on value added steel products for customers with demanding technical applications in the automotive  appliance  container  industrial machinery  construction and oil and gas industries 
in addition to our facilities in north america  u 
s 
steel has significant operations in central europe through u 
s 
steel ko ice ussk  located in slovakia  and u 
s 
steel balkan ussb  located in serbia 
u 
s 
steel s financial results are primarily determined by the combined effects of shipment volume  selling prices  production costs and product mix 
the primary drivers for u 
s 
steel are economic conditions in the united states  europe and  to a lesser extent  other steel consuming regions  the levels of worldwide steel production and consumption  pension and other benefits costs  and raw material iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc and tin and energy natural gas and electricity costs 
u 
s 
steel s long term success depends on our ability to implement our strategy to continue to increase our value added product mix  to expand our global business platform  to improve our capital structure and strengthen our balance sheet  to improve our reliability and cost competitiveness  to become a world leader in safety and environmental performance  and to attract and retain a diverse workforce with the talent and skills needed for our long term success 
in north america  u 
s 
steel is focused on providing value added steel products to our target markets 
in europe  our strategy is to be a leading producer and a prime supplier of steel to growing european markets  to expand our customer base by providing reliable delivery of high quality steel and to invest in value added facilities  including the automotive hot dip galvanizing line that started up in february for a fuller description of our strategy  see item business description business strategy 
some of the other key issues which will impact the global steel industry  including u 
s 
steel  are the sustainability of current steel prices  the cost of purchased raw materials and energy  the level of unfunded pension and other benefits obligations  the magnitude and durability of the world economic recovery  the degree of further industry consolidation  and the impact of production and consumption of steel in china  which has resulted in volatility in steel raw material supplies and global steel supply and pricing 
steel imports to the united states in reached record highs and may increase again in depending on the relative strength of the us dollar  market pricing  consumption in the united states versus other regions and foreign production levels 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of u 
s 
steel s financial condition and results of operations is based upon u 
s 
steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for 
table of contents deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations  potential litigation claims and settlements  and assets and obligations related to employee benefits 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
pensions and other benefits the recording of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pensions and other benefits is based on  among other things  assumptions of the expected annual return on plan assets  discount rate  escalation or other changes in retiree health care costs and plan participation levels 
changes in the assumptions or differences between actual and expected changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of u 
s 
steel s plans could cause net periodic benefit costs to increase or decrease materially from year to year as discussed below 
u 
s 
steel bases its estimate of the annual expected return on plan assets on the historical long term rate of return experienced by u 
s 
steel s plan assets  the investment mix of plan assets between debt  equities and other investments  and our view of market returns expected in the future 
based on a review of these factors  u 
s 
steel kept the expected annual return on pension plan assets for our main pension plan at percent for the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension and other benefits liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in setting these rates  we utilize several merrill lynch average aaa aa corporate bond indexes and both the year and the year u 
s 
treasury bond rates as a preliminary indication of interest rate movements and levels  and we also look to an internally calculated rate determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher rated zero coupon corporate bonds theoretically available in the marketplace 
based on this evaluation at december   u 
s 
steel increased the discount rate used to measure both pension and other benefits obligations from percent to percent 
higher discount rates decrease the actuarial losses of the plans and will favorably impact net periodic pension and other benefits costs by approximately million in u 
s 
steel determines the escalation trend in per capita health care costs based on historical rate experience under u 
s 
steel s insurance plans 
assumed health care cost trend rates no longer have a significant effect on the amounts reported for u 
s 
steel s health care plans  other than the benefit plan offered to retired mineworkers  since a cost cap was negotiated in with the usw 
most non union benefits are limited to flat dollar payments that are not affected by escalation 
for measurement purposes  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
net periodic pension cost  including multiemployer plans  is expected to total approximately million in compared to million in total other benefits costs in are expected to be approximately million compared to million in 
table of contents a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percent change in the significant assumptions used in the pension and other benefits calculations is provided in the following table hypothetical rate increase decrease in millions of dollars expected return on plan assets incremental increase decrease in expected pension costs for discount rate incremental increase decrease in expected pension other benefits costs for pension other benefits liabilities at december  health care cost escalation trend rates incremental increase decrease in expected other benefits costs for changes in the assumptions for expected annual return on plan assets and the discount rate do not impact the funding calculations used to derive minimum funding requirements for the pension plans 
for further cash flow discussion  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition  cash flows and liquidity liquidity 
asset impairments asset impairments are recognized when the carrying value of productive assets exceeds their aggregate projected undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows are based on management s long range estimates of market conditions and the overall performance associated with the individual asset or asset grouping 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if the probability of disposition of the assets differs from that previously estimated by management  additional asset write downs may be required 
taxes u 
s 
steel records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event that u 
s 
steel determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should u 
s 
steel determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
u 
s 
steel expects to generate future taxable income to realize the benefits of our net deferred tax assets 
u 
s 
steel makes no provision for deferred us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of usse because management intends  without regard to the one time repatriation in  indefinitely to reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
see note to the financial statements 
undistributed foreign earnings at december  amounted to approximately  million 
if such earnings were not permanently reinvested  a us deferred tax liability of approximately million would have been required 
u 
s 
steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss for items that have been or may be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  tax ruling or other positions or authority  an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
environmental remediation u 
s 
steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
u 
s 
steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made

although higher than in  capability utilization in was negatively affected especially in the latter part of the year as we reduced our operations to balance production with lower customer demand 
flat rolled segment income in declined by million compared to the decrease primarily resulted from lower steel and commercial coke shipment volumes and higher costs for raw materials  outages  energy and labor 
these were partially offset by increased average realized prices for flat rolled products and higher transfer values for steel rounds supplied to tubular 
capability utilization in was adversely affected by the rebuild of u 
s 
steel s largest blast furnace as well as lower demand levels early in the year as a result of high service center and end customer inventory levels 
segment results for usse logo usse segment income in was significantly improved from primarily due to higher shipment volumes and lower raw material costs 
these were partially offset by higher energy costs and net unfavorable currency effects 
usse segment income of million for increased by million from due mainly to higher average realized prices  partially offset by increased raw material and outage costs 
capability utilization declined in and primarily due to the inclusion of ussb as one of its two blast furnaces was not operational until the third quarter of capability utilization was also adversely affected in by the rebuild of our largest european blast furnace in slovakia and in by operational difficulties with a blast furnace early in the year 

table of contents segment results for tubular logo logo logo the increases in tubular segment income in and in as compared to and  respectively  resulted mainly from higher average realized prices  partially offset by higher costs for steel rounds 
results for other businesses the million increase from to was mainly due to improved results for iron ore pellet operations  primarily due to higher selling prices  as well as higher income for transportation services and real estate operations 
the decline in income from other businesses from million in to million in was mainly due to lower results at iron ore pellet operations due to lower trade sales and increased costs for natural gas  partially offset by higher intersegment sales and improved results for real estate activities and transportation services 
items not allocated to segments workforce reduction charges of million in reflected employee severance and net benefit charges related to a voluntary workforce reduction program at ussb 
workforce reduction charges of million in reflected special termination benefits for a voluntary early retirement program offered to certain employees at ussk 
workforce reduction charges of million in reflected a pension settlement loss in the non qualified defined benefit pension plan related to the retirement of several executive management employees 
in the process of evaluating the potential effects of adopting sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 we identified items from prior years that required an adjustment 
these were not material and we did not use the cumulative adjustment alternative 
these out of period adjustments resulted in a net charge of million in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents an impairment review of a small wholly owned german subsidiary of ussk was completed in accordance with statement of accounting financial standards fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and  as a result  an asset impairment charge of million was recorded in depreciation  depletion and amortization on the statement of operations during the first quarter of loss from sale of certain assets of million in resulted from the subsequent sale of the small wholly owned german subsidiary of ussk referred to above

net interest and other financial costs in included a favorable adjustment of million related to interest accrued for prior years income taxes and a million charge resulting from the early redemption of certain senior notes 
excluding these items  the million decrease from to was mainly due to favorable changes in foreign currency effects and increased interest income 
excluding the one time items  the million increase from to primarily reflected an unfavorable change in foreign currency effects 
this was partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the retirement of ussk long term debt in november and the redemption of certain senior notes in april  higher interest income and lower interest on tax related liabilities 
net interest and other financial costs includes foreign currency gains and losses which  through december   included amounts related to the remeasurement of ussk s and ussb s net monetary assets into the us dollar  which was the functional currency for both until december  as of january   the functional currency for usse was changed from the us dollar to the euro primarily because of significant changes in economic facts and circumstances as a result of slovakia s entry into the european union eu and the subsequent entry of the slovak koruna into the exchange rate mechanism ii in preparation for slovakia s adoption of the euro 
other factors that contributed to this change are the evolution of usse into an autonomous business segment  the settlement of ussk s us dollar denominated debt and the establishment of euro based debt facilities 
this change in functional currency has been applied on a prospective basis and resulted in a credit to the foreign currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income of million at the date of change 
after january   assets and liabilities of these entities are translated from euros to us dollars at period end exchange rates  and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable period 
resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity 

table of contents see note to the financial statements for further information regarding net interest and other financial costs 
income taxes the income tax provision in was million  compared to million in and million in the provision in included a favorable adjustment of million  recorded in the second quarter  primarily related to the refinement of assumptions used to determine the estimated tax accrual 
the provision in included a charge of million resulting from the million pre tax gain from the gary property tax settlement and a million charge resulting from the repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the provision in included a charge of million related to a settlement with the european union eu regarding tax benefits for ussk under slovakia s foreign investors tax credit  and a million favorable effect relating to an adjustment of prior years taxes 
the tax provisions in all three years were primarily the result of pre tax results from domestic operations 
during and  a current tax provision was recorded for ussk because the provisions of the slovak income tax act permit ussk to claim a tax credit of percent of the current statutory rate of percent for the years through  compared to a percent credit in previous years 
as a result of conditions imposed when slovakia joined the eu that were amended by the settlement with the eu  the total tax credit granted to ussk is limited to million for the period through based on the credits previously used and forecasts of future taxable income  management expects that this limit will be reached during additional conditions for claiming the tax credit were established when slovakia joined the eu 
these conditions limit ussk s annual production of flat rolled products and its sales of flat rolled products into the eu 
management does not believe the production and sales limits are materially burdensome  and they will expire at the end of  if not before 
pretax income for the years  and included million  million and million  respectively  attributable to foreign sources 
as of december   u 
s 
steel had a net domestic deferred tax asset of million 
at december   the amount of foreign deferred tax assets recorded was million  net of an established valuation allowance of million 
net foreign deferred tax assets will fluctuate as the value of the us dollar changes with respect to the euro  the slovak koruna and the serbian dinar 
a full valuation allowance is recorded for serbian deferred tax assets due to the cumulative losses experienced since the acquisition of ussb 
as ussb generates sufficient income  the valuation allowance of million for serbian taxes would be partially or fully reversed at such time that it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
management will continue to monitor and assess taxable income  deferred tax assets and tax planning strategies to determine the need for  and the appropriate amount of  any valuation allowance 
see note to the financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 
net income net income in was  million  compared to million in and  million in the changes primarily reflected the factors discussed above 
financial condition  cash flows and liquidity financial condition current assets at year end increased million from year end primarily due to increased receivables and higher inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable primarily resulted from higher sales in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  due mainly to higher average realized steel prices 
the increase in inventories was mainly due to higher quantities and prices of raw materials 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this statement requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan on the balance sheet and has no income statement effect 
the 
table of contents funded status of a plan is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation 
fas no

additional minimum pension liabilities amls and the related intangible assets applicable to pension plans under fas no 
employer s accounting for pensions  if any  are no longer required after adoption of the new standard 
as of december   the actuarial measurement of the main defined benefit pension plan s liabilities indicated that it was underfunded on an accumulated benefit obligation abo basis and an aml was needed 
this caused a non cash charge to equity net of tax of  million in as of december  and prior to the adoption of fas no 
 the actuarial measurement indicated that the plan was overfunded and an aml was not required 
other smaller pension plans were also re measured and amls were calculated as of december  including all pension plans  aml entries that would have been recorded but for the adoption of fas no 
would have established a prepaid pensions asset of billion  eliminated the intangible pension asset of million and resulted in a net credit to equity of billion  which would have decreased the accumulated other comprehensive loss 
however  with the adoption of fas no 
 the aml entries were offset with entries that decreased the prepaid pensions asset by billion and increased the accumulated other comprehensive loss by billion 
the net effect from these pension entries was a million net credit to equity  which decreased the accumulated other comprehensive loss 
fas no 
entries for other benefits increased employee benefits by million and increased the accumulated other comprehensive loss by million 
current liabilities at year end decreased million from year end as the decrease in short term debt and current maturities of long term debt  which resulted primarily from the repayment and termination of ussk s million credit facility  was partially offset by the increase in payroll and benefits payable  which includes a million payable that will be used to assist retirees from national steel with health care costs 
this liability increased million since year end and remains outstanding because the associated trust arrangement has not been established 
this excludes related interest payable of million  which is recorded in accrued interest 
see results of operations operating expenses profit based union payments 
long term debt at december  decreased million from december  primarily because we repurchased most of our senior notes due august  the series b mandatory convertible preferred shares automatically converted into  thousand shares of common stock during the second quarter of the accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by million as the million net increase resulting from the pension and other benefits changes discussed above was more than offset by decreases due primarily to the translation adjustments resulting from the change in the functional currency in slovakia and serbia as discussed above  and subsequent translation effects

steel accrues an annual cost for retiree medical and retiree life benefit obligations under plans covering our active and retiree populations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these obligations will require corporate cash in future years to the extent that trust assets are restricted or insufficient and to the extent that company contributions are required by law or union labor agreement 
amounts in the years through reflect our current estimate of corporate cash outflows and are net of the projected use of funds available from asset trusts 
the accuracy of this forecast of future cash flows depends on various factors such as actual asset returns  the mix of assets within the asset trusts  medical escalation and discount rates used to calculate obligations  the availability of surplus pension assets allowable for transfer to pay retiree medical claims and company decisions or restrictions related to our trusts for retiree healthcare and life insurance that impact the timing of the use of trust assets

future requirements for u

steel s business needs  including the funding of acquisitions and capital expenditures  scheduled debt maturities  contributions to employee benefit plans  and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies  are expected to be financed by a combination of internally generated funds including asset sales  proceeds from the sale of stock  borrowings  refinancings and other external financing sources 
increases in interest rates can increase the cost of future borrowings and make it more difficult to raise capital 
this opinion is a forward looking statement based upon currently available information 
to the extent that operating cash flow is materially lower than current levels or external financing sources are not available on terms competitive with those currently available  future liquidity may be adversely affected

environmental matters  litigation and contingencies u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet clean air act obligations and similar obligations in europe  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent that these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that our major domestic and many european integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that our relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills  some foreign steel producers and producers of materials which compete with steel  all of which may not be required to incur equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to our prior disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
most of our competitors do not have similar historic liabilities

it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation

the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements

for u 
s 
steel europe  first quarter shipments are expected to increase from the fourth quarter  and average realized prices are expected to be slightly lower as the result of increased import product availability in the european markets 
shipments and average realized prices for the tubular segment in the first quarter of are expected to decrease from the fourth quarter as import levels and customer inventories remain high 
first quarter costs for all of our reportable segments are expected to be in line with the fourth quarter 
first quarter results for other businesses are expected to be consistent with historical first quarter results  but will decline substantially from the fourth quarter due primarily to normal seasonal effects at our iron ore operations in minnesota and the non recurrence of fourth quarter land sales

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments u 
s 
steel uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage our market risk 
management has authorized the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to manage exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase of natural gas and nonferrous metals  and also certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
derivative instruments used for trading and other activities have been marked to market and the resulting gains or losses recognized in the current period in income from operations 
for future periods  u 
s 
steel may elect to use hedge accounting for certain transactions  primarily related to forecasted natural gas purchases 
for those transactions  the impact of the effective portion of the hedging instrument will be recognized in other comprehensive income until the natural gas purchase is settled 
once the purchase is settled  the effect of the hedged item will be recognized in income 
while u 
s 
steel s risk management activities generally reduce market risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for raw material purchases and products sold  such activities can also encompass strategies that assume price risk 
management believes that the use of derivative instruments  along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls  does not expose u 
s 
steel to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect u
