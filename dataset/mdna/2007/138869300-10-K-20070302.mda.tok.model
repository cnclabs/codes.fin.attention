item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of and future outlook what did we spend cash on during the year we ended the year with million of unrestricted cash and short term investments 
the million of short term investments are all auction rate certificates that have maturities ranging from seven to days 
we began the year with million in cash and sources of cash during included a net of million raised in equity transactions and the sale of securities for million 
cash used in operations during  excluding purchases of short term investments  amounted to million and capital spending for the briggs mine re start totaled million 
significant uses of cash for operations are summarized as follows selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million 
o includes holding costs at the briggs mine of million  and o includes ongoing legal costs for mcdonald of million 
exploration spending amounted to million 
asset retirement obligation spending amounted to million primarily for capping the old leach pads and water treatment studies at kendall and leach pad rinsing at the briggs mine 
what are our results of operation during  we sold  ounces of gold at an average price of further gold production and sales during is expected to be insignificant unless we are successful in obtaining the financing necessary to re start the briggs mine 
once we have raised the capital necessary to re start the briggs mine  we expect mine production to begin approximately six months after we start the leach pad construction 
once we begin the re start  the critical construction item is the addition to the leach pad  followed by the refurbishment of the mining equipment and fortunately we still have all of the key operation permits necessary to restart the briggs mine 
what have we done to increase shareholder value as part of our strategy to optimize undervalued assets and to focus on gold deposits in nevada  on the last business day of we completed an asset exchange agreement with various subsidiaries of newmont mining company newmont to acquire the nsr royalty held by newmont on our briggs mine in inyo county  california 
in addition  we entered into an agreement with newmont to acquire an option on the adelaide gold project in humboldt county  nevada and the tuscarora gold project in elko county  nevada 
in exchange  newmont received from us certain mineral rights  surface leases  and facilities near lincoln  montana with associated intellectual property and newmont will assume all associated reclamation liability 
we retained a royalty interest on mineral rights provided by us in this transaction 
we have completed the briggs mine feasibility study and established both open pit and underground reserves 
the development of these initial reserves should provide us with the cash flows and the production base necessary to increase shareholder value and grow the company 
the sum of all the parts of the briggs area should provide a reasonable production platform for years to come 
see how is the briggs re start going and what progress have we made on the briggs satellite deposits the reward project continues to grow in size and quality and we have started the permitting process and hope to have the project permitted during see what progress have we made on the reward project our uranium joint ventures began drilling in late and will continue to drill in the second quarter of the initial results were promising and we hope to make significant progress during in locating an economic uranium ore body 
see what is happening on our uranium joint ventures during we were successful in monetizing owned securities for million 
monetizing these assets is an ongoing project that may result in additional asset sales  exchanges or the development of joint venture activities 
the asset sources for these potential transactions include our substantial mineral interests in montana  royalty interests in argentina and proprietary property information related to past exploration or development work 

table of contents how much property and mineralized material do we now control our mining properties and associated in place mineralized material represent our most important assets 
a summary of the property acreages that we control is as follows fee fee property location surface mineral patented b unpatented briggs mine california reward project nevada seven up pete montana cr nevada nevada industrial minerals montana cr montana montana converse jv wyoming a cr kendall montana total acreage a sand creek jv lands not included in these totals 
b patented claims are owned fee simple which combine the surface and mineral estates 
a summary of the in place mineralized material estimated to be contained on the above properties is as follows mineralized average material gold grade cut off gold property location million tons opt grade opt briggs mine inyo county  california cecil r satellite deposit mineral hill satellite deposit suitcase satellite deposit reward project beatty  nevada seven up pete lincoln  montana total mineralized material as of december   briggs proven and probable reserves amounted to  ounces contained in million tons at an average gold grade of ounces per ton opt 
a gold cutoff grade of opt was used for underground stope designs and a cutoff grade of opt was utilized for open pit estimation and underground development material which must be mined regardless of grade 
a gold price was utilized for mine design purposes 
we are constantly evaluating our properties for development 
we have completed the feasibility study for the briggs mine and are evaluating the best use of our funds and potential financing to increase shareholder value 
the reward project is in the process of developing a feasibility study which is dependant on acquiring key operating permits and detailed engineering and costing studies 
the seven up pete project requires significantly more progress before we can update the feasibility study that was completed in we update our mineralized material estimates from time to time as we conduct additional drilling or as the status of our land positions change 

table of contents how is the briggs re start going we completed our briggs mine re start feasibility studies for both the open pit and underground mining options 
these studies demonstrate that restarting mining operations at briggs is economically feasible 
these studies have led to the development of an incremental strategy to increase both the size and mine life of the briggs mine 
in this strategy  we intend to initiate mining on the currently defined areas of reserve and mineralization as outlined by the feasibility studies depending on the arrangement of adequate financing 
additional upside may be available from the goldtooth structure which remains open along strike and possibly to depth 
we are continuing to drill step out holes to test the additional potential along strike in this extensive and relatively under explored system 
the high grade briggs north structure contains an estimated in situ mineralized material of  tons averaging opt gold using a cutoff grade of opt and mineralized material has also been estimated for the cecil r  suitcase and mineral hill deposits 
these deposits will require additional drilling  feasibility studies  and permitting before they can be developed 
a cash flow analysis was developed for the combined open pit and underground case without consideration of incremental underground reserve development or satellite deposit production 
total operating cash cost is estimated at around per ounce of gold produced over approximately a three year mine life 
the studies outline an initial production of  ounces of gold over this period 
initial capital to re commence operations totals approximately million including deferred underground development of million 
at a gold price of per ounce  the combined case provides an internal rate of return of approximately and a cash flow of million after capital recovery 
each change in gold price affects the cash flows by approximately million 
a predevelopment period of approximately five months will be required to initiate production once financing is arranged 
underground development would occur over a twelve month period concurrent with production 
adequate financing  leach pad construction and the retention of qualified personnel are the most significant risk factors that may impact our estimated timeline 
what progress have we made on the briggs satellite deposits in july  we announced the acquisition of the mineral hill and suitcase deposits located within four miles of our briggs mine 
we issued  shares of common stock related to this purchase 
evaluation of existing drill hole and geologic information available for mineral hill and suitcase during supports an in place mineralized material estimate of million tons at an average gold grade of opt for mineral hill and supports an estimate of million tons at an average grade of opt for suitcase 
these estimates utilize a gold cutoff grade of opt 
additional drilling would be required to expand or to further validate these results 
during the second quarter of  we drilled six additional holes on our cecil r deposit  which have now been consolidated with our existing drillhole database 
a new estimate of in place mineralized material incorporating the new data is million tons at an average grade of opt for the cecil r deposit using a cutoff grade of opt 
metallurgical testwork performed on drill cuttings from this drilling program indicates that a good gold recovery  similar to that experienced at our briggs mine  can be expected using heap leach technology 
these three satellite deposits remain open for potential expansion both along strike and at depth 
through future drilling and feasibility studies  we hope to prove that the mineralized material contained in these deposits can be developed into economic reserves that could be processed at the briggs mine facilities to possibly extend the useful life of the operation 
continued exploration of these deposits will depend on an allocation from our limited resources to fund our various ongoing projects 
these deposits also require permitting before mining could commence 
what progress have we made on the reward project our reward project located near beatty  nevada  is our next highest priority behind the re start of the briggs mine 
as the next step towards completing a feasibility study at reward  we began an infill and step out drill program in september designed to further define the extent and grade of the previously acquired mineralized material 
on october  we announced the results of reverse circulation rc holes  totaling  feet 
highlights from that announcement included 
table of contents from to length hole no 
feet feet feet length meter au assay opt au assay gram ton rc rc rc rc rc these holes were designed to test extensions of the known mineralization and to fill in data gaps within our current pit design 
we are analyzing these results and planning additional drilling in an effort to expand and further test the size of this deposit which remains open both down dip and along strike 
in addition  we have commenced permitting activities and are conducting various engineering studies required to complete a feasibility study 
our goal for this project is to move rapidly to complete the feasibility study and to secure board of director approval  permits  and financing 
our intent is to place reward into production as soon as possible to augment the potential production from the briggs mine and its satellite deposits 
during  we completed our phase   foot drilling program and have developed a new geologic model and estimate of mineralized material which now shows an in situ estimate of million tons at an average grade of opt gold utilizing a cutoff grade of opt 
this drilling program could significantly improve project economics by converting waste into mineralized material 
slope angle studies have also commenced to justify the use of steeper slope angles in the mine design  which could decrease the strip ratio and improve project economics 
what are our plans for the seven up pete property our interest in the seven up pete property contains in place mineralized material estimated at million tons of mineralized material at an average gold grade of opt based on a cutoff grade of opt 
we intend to move this project forward concentrating primarily on the evaluation of flotation or other potential non cyanide processing techniques 
preliminary testwork utilizing conventional flotation and gravity concentration recovery has returned positive results  but additional optimization testwork is required to further demonstrate the viability of this process route 
a portion of the deposit not included in the above mineralized material is controlled by third parties and we have been in negotiations with them in order to consolidate the seven up pete deposit 
consolidation of the property may increase the viability of placing it into production sometime in the future  but there can be no assurance that the negotiation will result in the consolidation of the property or result in a viable project 
what is happening on the company s uranium joint ventures in the early s  canyon and its joint venture partners conducted an aggressive exploration program for uranium in the southern powder river basin of wyoming 
this program included mapping and drilling that resulted in the discovery of several instances of uranium mineralization 
over the past year we have reacquired land positions in this area through claim staking and leases with property holders 
canyon entered into the converse uranium joint venture converse jv with new horizon uranium corporation new horizon in january during  the joint venture has been analyzing information provided by canyon  consolidating land positions  and establishing drill targets around known uranium occurrences 
new horizon has committed to spend million  million and million in each of the first three years respectively to earn their first equity interest in this project 
they must expend an additional million over the following two years to earn up to a interest in the project and complete a feasibility study to earn a interest 
at this time  new horizon has not met its earn in hurdles and canyon still controls interest in the joint venture 
in august  the converse jv joined with high plains uranium high plains to form the sand creek joint venture sand creek jv 
sand creek jv is owned by the converse jv and by high plains 
the purpose of these joint ventures is to combine property positions over a portion of the total converse jv area of interest and to explore for and potentially develop uranium deposits in an area of known uranium occurrences 
the area of interest for this joint venture covers approximately  acres  located east and south of douglas  
table of contents wyoming 
in total  canyon will not be required to provide funding until its partners have contributed between and million of expenditures in these ventures 
in november  a drill program began in the western portion of the sand creek jv area and by the end of  holes were completed totaling  feet 
a follow up drill program consisting of approximately drill holes is planned for early as an extension of the initial drill holes 
the drilling program consisted of wide spaced  reconnaissance style drilling on five fences of drilling over a strike length of miles and with drill hole spacing of to  feet 
of the drill holes completed to date  holes encountered intercepts of uranium mineralization indicative of a roll front style uranium deposit 
in addition  the drill holes have provided considerable additional information regarding both the location of a uranium bearing roll front  its apparent orientation and rock types 
uranium mineralization has been previously identified in sediments of the white river formation that trends through the sand creek jv area 
what is the status of the company s legal cases in october  a plaintiff group including members of the shammel  ruckman  and harrell families  filed suit in the state of montana district court against us and our wholly owned subsidiary  cr kendall corporation 
the complaint alleges violation of water rights  property damage  trespass and negligence in connection with the operation of the kendall mine and seeks unspecified damages and punitive damages 
the kendall mine ceased operations in in february  we entered into a settlement and release agreement with eight of the twelve plaintiffs in this suit 
the former mcdonald deposit was discovered and drilled by our now wholly owned seven up pete venture spv 
this large  low grade  deposit is highly amenable to gold recovery utilizing cyanide recovery technology with heap leaching 
cyanide recovery technologies for new open pit gold and silver mines were made illegal in the state of montana in with the passage of the anti cyanide ballot initiative i we  along with the other co plaintiffs  filed suits against the state of montana in state and federal courts in april seeking to overturn i or  alternatively  to obtain a taking damage award for the value of the spv properties seven up pete venture  et al 
v the state of montana 
on june   the montana supreme court upheld the i initiative and denied that a taking had occurred 
this ruling was appealed directly to the us supreme court 
in february  the us supreme court denied us a grant of certiorari 
we then reinstated our federal lawsuit in the us district court for the district of montana  which later dismissed our taking claims stating  in part  a lack of jurisdiction 
we have subsequently filed a notice to appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
all briefs before this court have now been filed and we are waiting on further action by the court 
in addition  the company has filed a breach of contract complaint against the state of montana related to the termination of the mcdonald gold project s state mineral leases 
in february  we announced the dismissal of a march lawsuit citing clean water act violations in the case of the montana environmental information center  inc and earthworks mineral policy center inc  the plaintiffs  vs 
canyon resources corporation and cr kendall corporation 
following a motion to dismiss by the plaintiffs  the suit was dismissed without prejudice 

table of contents liquidity capital resources it is expected that our basic cash requirements over the next months can be funded through a combination of existing cash  short term investments and if necessary asset sales 
however  should we proceed with our plan to re start the briggs mine additional financing will be required for equipment purchases and repairs  waste stripping and other development costs 
we do not have the capital resources sufficient to re start and operate the briggs mine without additional financing 
in order to do so  we could seek to obtain funding from multiple sources which might include private equity investments  public equity offering  debt  or asset sales 
based on our current stock price  we do not expect the exercise of options and warrants to be a significant source of funds during we expect the old leach solution at briggs to be evaporated by mid and any related revenues from gold production will be minimal during we estimate that we need approximately million to re start the briggs mine open pit operations and approximately million for the underground operations which would begin to generate operating cash flow after approximately six months from re start 
long term liquidity should be improved by the re start of the briggs mine and successful and profitable gold production 
additionally  we are continually evaluating business opportunities such as joint ventures  mergers and or acquisitions with the objective of increasing share value by creating additional cash flow both to sustain us and to provide future sources of funds for growth 
while we believe we will be able to finance our continuing activities and briggs re start plans  there are no assurances of success in this regard or in our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets  joint ventures  or other arrangements in the future 
if management s plans are not successful  our ability to operate could be adversely impacted 
we may also require additional funding to move the reward project to feasibility 
the source of that funding will most likely be provided by investors in the form of equity or debt  but we may also include equipment financing and possible asset sales or exchanges as additional forms of financing 
financing transactions on june   we completed a private placement financing that raised million approximately million net through the sale of million units 
this included the sale of million shares of the company s common stock and million series a warrants with an exercise price of and a term of three years 
the transaction was priced at per unit  representing a discount to the twenty day volume weighted average of the closing price of our common stock 
in connection with the financing  we paid the placement agent a cash placement agent fee of million and million warrants plus paid other legal and accounting fees associated with the financing and registration of the underlying shares 
the placement agent warrants were not exercisable for a period of six months from the date of closing and had an exercise price of and a term of three years

at december   the surety held the following collateral for such bonds cash in the amount of million  a bank letter of credit in the amount of million which is collateralized with cash  and a security interest in  acres of real property mineral interests in montana 
in  we agreed to make additional cash deposits with the surety totaling million over a three year period at the rate of million per year  commencing june  the company has not made any deposits to date and on february   the company received notice from the surety that canyon is in default of its obligations under the collateral agreement 
the surety has requested that the company provide them with million in cash no later than march  the surety s request does not represent an expense to the company and we have the available cash and investments to fund the request 
if we funded the entire request in cash rather than with other collateral  it could impact the timing and cost of any future financings 
the company is reviewing its rights under the bond and collateral agreements 
if an acceptable rescheduling of the deposit requirements cannot be agreed to  the surety company could seek to terminate the bonds which could result in the company becoming liable for the principal amounts under its collateral agreement with the surety company

critical accounting policies and estimates the ensuing discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us and contained within this annual report on form k 
certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring that certain assumptions be made with respect to values or conditions which cannot be made with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
therefore  the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units of production amortization determination  completion of feasibility studies  recoverability and timing of gold production from the heap leaching process  environmental  reclamation and closure obligations  asset impairments including estimates of future cash flows  useful lives and residual values of intangible assets  fair value of stock based compensation  fair value of financial instruments and 
table of contents nonmonetary transactions  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following significant assumptions and estimates affect our more critical practices and accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserves and mineralized material as of december   we have reported mineral reserves of  contained ounces of gold at our briggs mine and have reported mineralized material on a number of our properties 
when we have producing mines or are developing a mine we estimate our ore reserves on at least an annual basis 
we update our mineralized material estimates from time to time as we conduct additional drilling or as the status of our land positions change 
there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves and mineralized material  including many factors beyond our control 
ore reserve and mineralized material estimates are based upon engineering evaluations of assay values derived from samplings of drill holes and other openings 
additionally  declines in the market price of gold may render certain reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to mine 
further  availability of permits  changes in operating and capital costs  and other factors could materially and adversely affect ore reserves 
we use our ore reserve estimates in determining the unit basis for mine depreciation and amortization of closure costs 
changes in ore reserve estimates could significantly affect these items 
we produced gold at our briggs mine using the heap leach process 
this process involves the application of leach solutions by drip irrigation to ore stacked on an impervious pad 
as the solution percolates through the heap  gold is dissolved from the ore into solution 
this solution is collected and processed with activated carbon  which precipitates the gold out of solution and onto the carbon 
through the subsequent processes of acid washing and pressure stripping  the gold is returned to solution in a more highly concentrated state 
this concentrated solution of gold is then processed in an electrowinning circuit  which re precipitates the gold onto cathodes for melting into gold dor bars 
no leach solutions have been added to the briggs heap leach system since april when briggs was in production certain estimates regarding this overall process are required for inventory accounting and reserve reporting  the most significant of which are the amount and timing of gold to be recovered 
although we can calculate with reasonable certainty the tonnage and grades of gold ore placed under leach by engineering survey and laboratory analysis of drill hole samples  the recovery and timing factors are influenced by the size of the ore under leach crushed verses run of mine and the particular mineralogy of a deposit being mined 
we base our estimates on laboratory leaching models  which approximate the recovery from gold ore under leach on the heap 
from this data  we estimate the amount of gold that can be recovered and the time it will take for recovery 
we continually monitor the actual monthly and cumulative recovery from the heap as a check against the laboratory models  however  ultimate recovery will not be known with certainty until active leaching has stopped and pad rinsing is completed 
because it is impossible to physically measure the exact amount of gold remaining under leach  we calculate  or derive the amount  by taking the difference between the cumulative estimated recoverable gold placed on the heap and the known amount of gold cumulatively produced as dor 
impairments of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of its mine development  mineral interest and mining properties when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the properties may be impaired 
for these assets  an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest expected to result from the use of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on discounted cash flows 
intangible assets subject to impairment are assessed for impairment at least annually or more frequently when changes in market conditions or other events occur 
impairments are measured based on estimated fair value 
fair value with respect to such mineral interests  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective january   would generally be assessed with reference to comparable property sales transactions in the market place 

table of contents during the second quarter of in connection with the montana supreme court decision affirming the termination of the mcdonald gold project s state mineral leases  the company wrote off their carrying value of million 
asset retirement obligations accounting for asset retirement obligations is based on the guidance of sfas no 
which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
fair value is determined by estimating the retirement obligations in the period an asset is first placed in service and then adjusting the amount for estimated inflation and market risk contingencies to the projected settlement date of the liability 
the result is then discounted to a present value from the projected settlement date to the date the asset was first placed in service or to the change in estimate timing 
the present value of the asset retirement obligation is recorded as an additional property cost and as an asset retirement liability 
the amortization of the additional property cost using the units of production method is included in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the accretion of the discounted liability is recorded as a separate operating expense in the company s statement of operations 
when a mine is shut down and begins the final reclamation  the company may decide to record the reclamation liability on an undiscounted basis depending on the time frame and materiality of the expenditures 
the asset retirement obligations of the kendall mine and the seven up pete venture are recorded on an undiscounted basis 
derivative instruments and hedging activities beginning in  the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities has been guided by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment to sfas no 
that guidance requires entities to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or a hedge of the foreign currency exposure 
during  we had used derivative financial instruments to manage well defined market risks associated with fluctuating gold prices 
floating rate forward sales contracts were used to manage our exposure to gold prices on a portion of future gold production 
these derivative instruments were not designated as hedges and were recognized as assets or liabilities and marked to market quarterly with changes recorded in earnings 
on settlement of a contract  against which we have delivered gold production  the contract price is recognized as revenue from the gold sale 
if financially settled  the resulting gain or loss is included in revenue if we had sufficient gold production to otherwise settle the contract by delivery 
gains or losses resulting from all other financially settled contracts are recorded as other income expense 
as of december   we did not have any open derivative contracts nor did we enter into any during the year

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices our future revenues  earnings and cash flow may be strongly influenced by changes in gold prices  which fluctuate widely and over which we have no control 
we may  if market conditions justify  enter into gold price protection arrangements in the future  if necessary  to ensure that we generate enough cash flows to support our growth and exploration plans and any debt related to the potential briggs mine financing 
we had no gold related derivatives outstanding as of december  and all gold sold during was sold at spot prices 

table of contents the risks associated with price protection arrangements include opportunity risk by limiting unilateral participation in upward prices  production risk associated with the requirement to deliver physical ounces against a forward commitment  and credit risk associated with counterparties to the hedged transaction 
as of december  we were not at risk related to gold related derivative instruments 
our future earnings and cash flow may be significantly impacted by changes in the market price of gold  uranium and other commodities 
gold prices can fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors  such as demand  inflation  interest rates  and economic policies of central banks  producer hedging  and the strength of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
during the last five years  the london pm fix gold price has fluctuated between a low of per ounce in december and a high of over per ounce in may we expect gold to be our primary product in the future  but we cannot currently reasonably estimate our future production and therefore we cannot comment on the impact that changes in gold prices could have on our projected pre tax earnings and cash flows during interest rates at december   our convertible debentures balance was approximately million at a fixed interest rate of 
currently  we believe our interest rate risk is minimal except to the extent we might incur new debt 
foreign currency the price of gold is denominated in us dollars  and our current gold production operations and significant properties are located primarily in the us we own foreign mineral rights primarily in the form of royalties which may create foreign currency exposure in the future when  and if  these foreign properties are placed in production
