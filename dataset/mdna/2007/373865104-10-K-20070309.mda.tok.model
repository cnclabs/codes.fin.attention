management overview the company s net income increased in compared with the company s net income totaled  or per share  compared with  or per share  for current year earnings were positively affected by increases within the company s net interest income and non interest income as well as a reduced level of provision for loan losses 
the improvement in the level of net interest income was largely attributable to strong loan growth 
loans outstanding grew by million or during the increase in non interest income was primarily credited to the gain derived from the sale of the company s portfolio of agency issued preferred stock during the third quarter of and an increased level of insurance revenues 
an offsetting factor to these positive earnings contributors was an increased level of non interest related operating expenses due in large part to the inclusion of the recent banking and insurance acquisitions 
effective january   the company completed the acquisition of stone city bancshares  inc which was in an adjacent market to its primary market area and effective october   the company completed the in market acquisition of pcb holding company 
in addition to these acquisitions  during the three year period ended december   the company invested in non controlling interests in the common stocks of four separate banking companies that operate in the indianapolis  evansville  louisville  and terre haute lafayette indiana banking markets 
as a result of making these four non controlling investments  the company has the opportunity to bid to purchase participations in loans that may be originated by these other banking companies from time to time  if and to the extent that the banking company desires to sell participations in such loans to third parties 
during the fourth quarter of  the company expanded its agricultural lending business by acquiring the southern indiana based agricultural loan portfolio of a regional banking company 
finally  effective october   the company completed the acquisition of the insurance agency business of keach and grove insurance  inc of bedford  indiana which was in the market of the company s recent banking acquisition of stone city bancshares  inc these acquisitions  purchases and investments have been undertaken to supplement organic growth within the company s primary markets 
management expects to continue to pursue similar strategic acquisition and investing opportunities should opportunities become available 
effective september   the company combined the charters of its six subsidiary banks into a single bank charter in order to simplify its corporate structure and better serve its customers  while retaining local direction of affiliate bank operations under the existing distinctive bank trade names in each of the markets served by the company

this merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
critical accounting policies and estimates the financial condition and results of operations for german american bancorp  inc presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection of and application of these policies involve estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are subject to change 
the critical accounting policies and estimates that the company has determined to be the most susceptible to change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of securities available for sale  and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and loss contingencies related to exposure from tax examinations 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the necessary allowance balance 
evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more often if deemed necessary 
the ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the company s control 
the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on other classified loans and pools of homogeneous loans  and consideration of past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance consists of two components of allocations  specific and general 
these two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
commercial and agricultural loans are subject to a standardized grading process administered by an internal loan review function 
the need for specific reserves is considered for credits when graded substandard or special mention  or when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicates the loan is impaired 
specific allocations on impaired loans are determined by comparing the loan balance to the present value of expected cash flows or expected collateral proceeds 
allocations are also applied to categories of loans not considered individually impaired but for which the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical averages  including those graded substandard or special mention and non performing consumer or residential real estate loans 
such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values 
general allocations are made for other pools of loans  including non classified loans  homogeneous portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans  and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss 
general allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a five year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios  judgmentally adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends 
due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses  the company s allowance for loan losses includes a minor unallocated component 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as economic uncertainties  lending staff quality  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  and broad portfolio quality trends 
therefore  the ratio of allocated to unallocated components within the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
mortgage servicing rights valuation mortgage servicing rights msrs were recognized and included with other assets for the allocated value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
servicing rights were expensed in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
impairment was evaluated based on the fair value of the rights  using groupings of the underlying loans as to type and age 
fair value was determined based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
to determine the fair value of msrs  the company used a valuation model that calculated the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
in using this valuation method  the company incorporated assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income  which included estimates of prepayment speeds  discount rate  cost to service  escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  ancillary income  late fees  and float income 
the company sold its mortgage servicing rights portfolio during the second quarter of currently  all residential loans that are sold in the secondary market are sold on a servicing released basis 
securities valuation securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported separately in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the company obtains market values from a third party on a monthly basis in order to adjust the securities to fair value 
additionally  all securities are required to be written down to fair value when a decline in fair value is other than temporary  therefore  future changes in the fair value of securities could have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
in determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary  management considers the reason for the decline  the extent of the decline and the duration of the decline 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding unrealized losses on the securities 
income tax expense income tax expense involves estimates related to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and loss contingencies related to exposure from tax examinations 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers the likelihood that sufficient taxable income of appropriate character will be generated within carryback and carryforward periods  including consideration of available tax planning strategies 
as of december   the company had a deferred tax asset of million representing various tax credit carryforwards 
based on the long carryforward periods available  management has assessed it more likely than not that these credits will be realized and no valuation allowance has been established on this asset 
loss contingencies  including assessments arising from tax examinations and tax strategies  are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in considering the likelihood of loss  management considers the nature of the contingency  the progress of any examination or related protest or appeal  the views of legal counsel and other advisors  experience of the company or other enterprises in similar matters  if any  and management s intended response to any assessment 
during the first quarter of  the company received notices of proposed assessments of unpaid financial institutions tax for the years and of approximately   net of federal tax  including interest and penalties of approximately  the company filed a protest with the indiana department of revenue contesting the proposed assessments and vigorously defended its position that the income of the nevada subsidiaries was not subject to the indiana financial institutions tax 
therefore  no tax provision was recognized for the potential assessment of additional financial institutions tax for and or for financial institutions tax with respect to any of the nevada subsidiaries in any period subsequent to  including the year ended december  during the first quarter of  the company and the indiana department of revenue entered into an agreement regarding the proposed assessment for tax years and as a result of this agreement the company was not required to pay any tax liability as assessed by the indiana department of revenue for tax years and in addition  tax years and are closed to further examination 
results of operations net income net income increased  or to  or per share in compared to  or per share during the increase in net income during compared with was attributable principally to an increase in net interest income of  a reduction in provision for loan losses of  and a gain on the sale of the company s portfolio of agency preferred stock of  which were partially mitigated by an increase of  in non interest expense 
the increases in net interest income and non interest expenses were largely attributable to acquisitions of pcb holding company and stone city bancshares  inc  which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
net income increased  or to  or per share in compared to  or per share during the earnings increase was largely attributable to the inclusion in s results of an after tax charge of  or per share  related to other than temporary impairment of the company s portfolio of federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and federal national mortgage association fnma preferred stocks 
in addition to the effect of the securities impairment charge  the earnings comparison of to was positively impacted by improvements in net interest income of  as well as increases in the level of other non interest income 
non interest income  excluding the impairment charge on equity securities in  increased by approximately  in compared to those increases were partially mitigated by increased non interest expense of  a significant portion of which related to increased employee health insurance costs  and increased income tax expense of   excluding the tax effect of the impairment charge in 
net interest income net interest income is the company s single largest source of earnings  and represents the difference between interest and fees realized on earning assets  less interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
several factors contribute to the determination of net interest income and net interest margin  including the volume and mix of earning assets  interest rates  and income taxes 
many factors affecting net interest income are subject to control by management policies and actions 
factors beyond the control of management include the general level of credit and deposit demand  federal reserve board monetary policy  and changes in tax laws 
net interest income increased  or an increase of  or on a tax equivalent basis for the year ended compared with the increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to an increased level of average earning assets and an increased net interest margin for the year ended compared with the higher level of earning assets was primarily attributable to an increase in the average level of loans outstanding that resulted from new loan activity and from the previously discussed banking acquisitions completed effective october  and effective january  average earning assets totaled million during compared with million during for  the net interest margin increased to compared to during net interest margin is tax equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets

provisions for loan losses totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the company s provision for loan losses declined during in conjunction with a decline in the company s level of non performing loans 
the largest factor in the company s ability to recognize the reduced level of provision for loan losses was the finalization of settlement of a previously identified large nonperforming credit in the second quarter of the company recognized a charge off of approximately  on this individual credit facility 
the specific allocation as of year end was for considerably more than the level of charge off allowing the company to recover the balance of the specific allocation assigned to this credit

the company s level of obligations of state and political subdivisions declined million or during and million or during the decline in obligations of state and political subdivisions has been primarily the result of the company s strategy to not invest in these traditionally longer term securities during periods of relatively low longer term interest rates 
the company continues to believe that at the proper time  investment in tax advantaged obligations of state and political subdivisions is prudent 
however  in the relatively low longer term interest rate environment  investments in these types of securities have not been undertaken 
the company s equity securities portfolio at year end consisted of non controlling common stock investments in five unaffiliated banking companies 
in prior years the equity securities also included the company s portfolio of floating rate preferred stock issued by fhlmc and fnma

management believes that core deposits continue to represent a stable and viable funding source for the company s operations 
demand  savings and money market deposits have provided a growing source of funding for the company in each of the periods reported

average borrowed funds increased million or during following a decline of million or in borrowings comprised approximately of total funding sources in   and the increase in average borrowed funds during was largely attributable to parent company borrowings that resulted from the banking acquisition activity during late and early certificates of deposits in denominations of  or more and brokered deposits are an additional source of other funding for the company s bank subsidiary 
large denomination certificates and brokered deposits increased million or during following an increase of million or in large certificates and brokered deposits comprised approximately of total funding sources in  in and in this type of funding is used as both long term and short term funding sources 
the bank subsidiary of the company also utilizes short term funding sources from time to time 
these sources consist of overnight federal funds purchased from other financial institutions  secured repurchase agreements that generally mature within one day of the transaction date  and secured overnight variable rate borrowings from the fhlb 
these borrowings represent an important source of short term liquidity for the company s bank subsidiary 
long term debt at the company s bank subsidiary is in the form of fhlb advances  which are secured by the pledge of certain investment securities and residential mortgage loans

for information regarding the financial condition  result of operations  and cash flows of the company  presented on a parent company only basis  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the company uses funds at the parent company level to pay dividends to its shareholders  to acquire or make other investments in other businesses or their securities or assets  to repurchase its stock from time to time  and for other general corporate purposes 
the parent company does not have access at the parent company level to the deposits and certain other sources of funds that are available to its bank subsidiary to support its operations 
instead  the parent company has historically derived most of its revenues from dividends paid to the parent company by its bank subsidiary 
the company s banking subsidiary is subject to statutory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the parent company 
the parent company has in recent years supplemented the dividends received from its subsidiaries with borrowings  which are discussed in detail below 
on december   the company and jpmorgan chase bank  na the lender executed and delivered to each other a second amended and restated loan and subordinated debenture purchase agreement restated agreement  and the company executed and delivered to the lender a million subordinated debenture  a million term note and a million revolving note pursuant to the restated agreement to evidence its obligations for amounts that may from time to time be borrowed thereunder 
the company s obligations under the term note and revolving note are secured by a pledge of all of the company s stock in its sole depository institution subsidiary  german american bancorp  pursuant to a pledge agreement 
the restated agreement established new credit facilities that replace the company s prior credit facilities with the lender 
among other changes  the restated agreement a continued through january  the company s ability under the prior agreement to access a million revolving credit line in order to support parent company liquidity needs from time to time  all of which was available for borrowing as of december   b restructured million of the prior million term loan as a new subordinated seven year loan that is intended to qualify as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes  and c lengthened the maturity schedule for repaying another million of the prior million term loan 
the remaining million of the million that was outstanding under the term loan with this lender was prepaid by the company on december   from parent company working capital 
the new term loan established under the restated agreement is evidenced by a new term note in the principal amount of million  which matures on the following schedule million principal amount payable on january  and million payable on january of each of the years through  inclusive 
interest is payable quarterly on the outstanding principal balance 
the new subordinated loan established under the restated agreement is evidenced by a subordinated debenture in the principal amount of million  and matures in a single installment of principal on january  interest is payable quarterly on the outstanding principal balance 
the new revolving loan established under the restated agreement is evidenced by a new revolving note in the principal amount of million  and matures on january   at which time all amounts borrowed under the revolving loan will become due and payable 
interest is payable quarterly on the outstanding principal balance 
pursuant to the restated agreement  the company made certain representations and warranties to the lender  and agreed to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants with the lender  which are substantially the same as the representations  warranties  and covenants that were included in the prior agreement 
among the affirmative covenants are provisions requiring that a the company maintain the capital ratios of the company and of its subsidiary bank s at levels that would be considered well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations of the federal banking agencies  and b the company maintain a consolidated ratio of i the sum of its non performing loans plus other real estate owned real estate that is neither used in the ordinary course of the business of the company or its subsidiaries nor held for future use oreo to ii the sum of the company s loans plus oreo  of not greater than 
at december   this ratio was 
among the company s negative covenants are provisions that generally prohibit the company and its subsidiaries  without the consent of the lender  from a becoming liable in respect of any indebtedness for borrowed money  other than in the ordinary course of business of the bank subsidiaries  b incurring liens on their assets  other than to secure borrowings in the ordinary course of business of the bank subsidiaries  c issuing trust preferred securities  and d acquiring other businesses in acquisition transactions that would be significant when measured by certain size restrictions described by the restated agreement 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the restated agreement  the lender may terminate the availability of future credit under the revolving loan facility and declare all amounts outstanding under the revolving loan and term loan to be due and payable in full 
in addition  in certain limited circumstances defined by the restated agreement  an event of default may entitle the lender to declare all amounts outstanding under the subordinated loan to be due and payable in full

risk management the company is exposed to various types of business risk on an on going basis 
these risks include credit risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
various procedures are employed at the company s affiliate banks to monitor and mitigate risk in the loan and investment portfolios  as well as risks associated with changes in interest rates 
following is a discussion of the company s philosophies and procedures to address these risks 
lending and loan administration primary responsibility and accountability for day to day lending activities rests with the company s subsidiary bank 
loan personnel at the subsidiary bank have the authority to extend credit under guidelines approved by the bank s board of directors 
the executive loan committee serves as a vehicle for communication and for the pooling of knowledge  judgment and experience of its members 
the committee provides valuable input to lending personnel  acts as an approval body  and monitors the overall quality of the bank s loan portfolio 
the corporate risk management committee  comprised of members of the company s and its subsidiary bank s executive officers and board of directors  strives to ensure a consistent application of the company s lending policies 
the company also maintains a comprehensive risk grading and loan review program  which includes quarterly reviews of problem loans  delinquencies and charge offs 
the purpose of this program is to evaluate loan administration  credit quality  loan documentation and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable  incurred credit losses identified during its loan review process 
management estimates the required level of allowance for loan losses using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgement  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of a specific reserves on individual credits  b general reserves for certain loan categories and industries  and overall historical loss experience  and c unallocated reserves based on performance trends in the loan portfolios  current economic conditions  and other factors that influence the level of estimated probable losses 
the need for specific reserves are considered for credits when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring 
allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands years ended december  balance of allowance for possible losses at beginning of period loans charged off residential mortgage loans agricultural loans commercial and industrial loans consumer loans total loans charged off recoveries of previously charged off loans residential mortgage loans agricultural loans commercial and industrial loans consumer loans total recoveries net loans recovered charged off additions to allowance charged to expense allowance from acquired subsidiary balance at end of period net charge offs to average loans outstanding provision for loan losses to average loans outstanding allowance for loan losses to total loans at year end the following table indicates the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated dollars in thousands residential mortgage loans agricultural loans commercial and industrial loans consumer loans unallocated total loans the allowance for loan losses at year end declined to million or of total loans compared to million or of total loans at year end and million or at year end the decline in the allowance for loan losses was largely attributable to a higher level of net charge offs  primarily related to commercial and industrial loans  during as compared with previous years 
net charge offs increased to million or of average loans outstanding during this level compares to million or of average loans outstanding in and million or of average loans outstanding during the increase in the level of net charge offs during was primarily attributable to three commercial credit facilities 
the increased level of net charge offs during and to a lesser degree in had been provided for during and therefore  the provision for loan loss declined by  in compared with while the loan loss provision remained relatively stable during compared with the charge off on the three previously mentioned credit facilities totaled approximately million or approximately of average loans outstanding 
as of year end  the specific allocations on these credits totaled approximately million or of average loans outstanding while at year end there were only nominal allocations for these credits due to the charge off activity during these credit facilities are discussed in additional detail in the following section of this report titled non performing assets 
the company continues to monitor trends and patterns in loan charge offs by various product types 
through use of migration analysis for commercial loans and continued analysis of charge off information for homogenous loan pools  data as of and for the relevant time periods ended december   suggested a lower level of allowance was needed to support probable incurred loan losses 
this  along with the previously discussed charge offs  resulted in a lower level of allowance at year end please see results of operations provision for loan losses and critical accounting policies and estimates allowance for loan losses for additional information regarding the allowance 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of a non accrual loans  b loans which have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  c loans past due days or more as to principal or interest  and  d other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more or when the borrower s ability to repay becomes doubtful 
uncollected interest accrued in the current year is reversed against income at the time a loan is placed on non accrual 
loans are charged off at days past due  or earlier if deemed uncollectible 
exceptions to the non accrual and charge off policies are made when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table presents an analysis of the company s non performing assets 
non performing assets december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans past due loans days or more restructured loans total non performing loans other real estate total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans the company s level of overall non performing assets declined by approximately million and non performing loans declined by approximately million during compared with year end the decline in the level of non accrual loans largely resulted from the resolution of an approximately million credit facility  which was extended to a borrower operating a retail grocery store chain 
under an approved bankruptcy plan  the company was paid approximately of the amount owed to it during april the remaining decline in non accrual loans was principally the result of partial charge offs that totaled million on two other commercial credit facilities that remain in work out status and are discussed in detail below 
the level of non performing loans remains at higher than historic levels  but is largely attributable to two specific credit facilities that were placed on non accrual status during the first of these credits is an approximately  loan after a partial charge off during to a manufacturing entity which has ceased operations 
during the third quarter of  the real estate and equipment of the manufacturing entity were sold at auction to an unrelated third party 
the closing of this auction sale has been delayed on a number of instances as various covenants and conditions included in the sales agreement have not been fully performed or satisfied 
based on current information available  the company expects that this sale will be completed by the end of the third quarter of the indebtedness owed the company on this credit is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the borrower s assets  including those sold at auction 
the second of these specific credits  which totals approximately million after a partial charge off during  was extended to a borrower operating two hotel facilities 
this credit is secured by a first priority lien on the hotel facilities 
the company has initiated foreclosure action and taken steps to place the properties under control of an independent management company upon receipt of title to the properties 
the company will continue to assess the internal classification of these credits and the level of specific allocation of the loan loss reserve attributable to these credits based upon the best information that is available from time to time  including the status of the sale of the manufacturing facility and the status of the hotel facilities 
during  the company  in accordance with its standard methodology for the identification of potential problem credits  downgraded the internal risk classification on the above mentioned credits and placed them on non accrual status 
the net effect of this activity was to increase the level of non performing loans for the company at year end as compared with year end interest income recognized on non performing loans for was  the gross interest income that would have been recognized in on non performing loans if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was  loans are typically placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
loan impairment is reported when full repayment under the terms of the loan is not expected 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate  or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
commercial and agricultural loans are evaluated individually for impairment 
smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total 
such loans include real estate loans secured by one to four family residences and loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures 
individually evaluated loans on non accrual are generally considered impaired 
impaired loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
the total dollar amount of impaired loans at december  was  for additional detail on impaired loans  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
liquidity and interest rate risk management liquidity is a measure of the ability of the company s subsidiary bank to fund new loan demand  existing loan commitments and deposit withdrawals 
the purpose of liquidity management is to match sources of funds with anticipated customer borrowings and withdrawals and other obligations to ensure a dependable funding base  without unduly penalizing earnings 
failure to properly manage liquidity requirements can result in the need to satisfy customer withdrawals and other obligations on less than desirable terms 
the liquidity of the parent company is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiary  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations explained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  as enhanced by its ability to draw upon term financing arrangements and a line of credit established by the parent company with a correspondent bank lender as described under sources of funds parent company funding sources  above 
the affiliate bank s source of funding is predominately core deposits  maturities of securities  repayments of loan principal and interest  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
the company s asset liability committee monitors compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements other than stand by letters of credit as disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committees and board of directors 
primary market risks  which impact the company s operations  are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the table 
lastly  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment 
the following table provides an assessment of the risk to npv in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the table indicates that as of december  the company s estimated npv might be expected to decrease under both an increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates dollars in thousands 
interest rate sensitivity as of december  changes net portfolio value net portfolio value as a of present value of assets in rates amount change npv ratio change bp bp base bp bp the above discussion  and the portions of management s discussion and analysis in item of this report that are referenced in the above discussion contain statements relating to future results of the company that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements relate to  among other things  simulation of the impact on net interest income from changes in interest rates 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied therein as a result of certain risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties expressed above  those that are described in management s discussion and analysis in item of this report  and those that are described in item of this report  business  under the caption forward looking statements and associated risks  which discussions are incorporated herein by reference
