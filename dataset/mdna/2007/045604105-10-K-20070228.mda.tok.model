overview 
we are engaged primarily in the operation of multifamily residential units that we own 
we also provide asset and property management services to third party owners of multifamily residential units for which we are paid fees 
our primary source of cash and revenue from operations is rents from the leasing of owned apartment units 
approximately of our consolidated revenue was generated from the leasing of these owned units for the twelve months ended december   and approximately of the property revenue generated by these owned properties was related to the market rate properties 
we consider property noi to be an important indicator of our overall performance 
property noi property operating revenue and interest income less property operating and maintenance expenses is a measure of the profitability of our properties  which has the largest impact of all of our sources of income and expense on our financial condition and operating results 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k for additional information regarding property noi and total noi  in addition to a reconciliation of total noi to consolidated net income in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
our four reportable segments are based upon types of property and services and consist of our market rate properties of total revenue  properties we acquired or developed within the prior year and properties that have been sold or are classified as held for sale  which segment is referenced as disposition acquisition of total revenue  our affordable housing properties of total revenue and management and service operations of total revenue  which is primarily derived from third party asset and property management operations 
our same community market rate midwest portfolio  consisting of properties  containing  units  accounts for of our revenue and of our noi 
while we achieved growth in net collected rents of in our midwest markets  we face continuing challenges in achieving growth similar to the growth realized in net collected rents in our mid atlantic and southeast markets  primarily due to a sluggish midwest economy with higher unemployment rates and a lack of job growth  coupled with fewer household formations 
in response to these conditions  our strategy has been to reduce our midwest property exposure by selling certain non core midwest properties and acquiring properties in other markets that have a greater potential for growth 
during  we sold eight properties containing  units  seven of which were located in ohio and one property located in north carolina  which was the only property that we owned or managed in that market 
in  we intend to continue with our strategy of reducing our midwest presence by selling properties 
we will also continue to evaluate potential property acquisitions in higher growth markets that we have identified 
however  strong competition for replacement properties in these markets may hinder our ability to find suitable replacement properties that satisfy our investment criteria 
we may also consider selling assets in any market  including the mid atlantic and southeast markets  where market conditions are such that the reinvestment of cash proceeds derived from a sale are expected to provide a significantly greater return on equity and an increase in cash flow 
we are also focused on reducing overall interest rate charges on our borrowings which  at december   had a weighted average rate of 
we plan to accomplish this goal by using sale proceeds to pay off debt or refinance existing debt with new debt at lower interest rates 
in order to increase property noi  we plan to continue to focus our efforts on improving revenue  controlling costs and realizing operational efficiencies at the asset level  both regionally and portfolio wide 
expectations portfolio performance we expect to increase our market rate property noi by approximately to in we expect our midwest portfolio to deliver noi of to driven by property revenue increases of to 
we also expect our mid atlantic and southeast portfolio to deliver noi increases of to as a result of property revenue increases of to 
property acquisitions and sales we plan to acquire approximately million of properties  while disposing of approximately million to million of properties 
defeasance and other prepayment costs we expect to incur approximately million in costs to defease prepay or refinance debt during federal income taxes 
we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended  commencing with our taxable year ending december  reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that of the income that would otherwise be considered as taxable income be distributed to shareholders 
providing we continue to qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on net income 
however  our service companies are subject to federal income tax 
a reit is precluded from owning more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer  other than a wholly owned subsidiary or another reit  and more than of the value of all securities of any one issuer 
as an exception to this prohibition  a reit is allowed to own up to of the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary trs that can provide non customary services to reit tenants and others without disqualifying the rents that a reit receives from its tenants 
however  no more than of the value of a reit s total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trs s 
the amount of intercompany interest and other expenses between a trs and a reit are subject to arms length allocations 
we have elected trs status for all of our service companies 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and liquidity 
significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows significant cash sources uses for the year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    property acquisition and capital expenditures   property disposition proceeds  net    decreases increases related to debt net    redemption of class a preferred shares  issuance of class b cumulative redeemable preferred shares  cash dividends and operating partnership distributions paid    purchase of treasury shares under repurchase plan   our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by operations  short term borrowings on the lines of credit and proceeds from property sales 
the decrease in cash provided by operations in compared to was primarily due to the payment of million of defeasance and other prepayment costs  which were funded by property sales and secured borrowings 
excluding these costs  cash flow from operations would have increased million primarily due to changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable resulting from the timing of cash payments 
during  funds received from the sale of properties were primarily used to reduce debt  including the payment of associated defeasance and other prepayment costs 
sale proceeds were also used to repurchase our common shares and partially fund capital expenditures 
the decrease in cash provided by operations in compared to was primarily due to an increase in property operating and maintenance expenses  an increase in interest expense and a reduction in net painting service revenue 
these factors were partially offset by increases in property revenue 
see the discussion of our results of operations below for additional information regarding these fluctuations 
additionally  in april  our ceo repaid two notes to us totaling million  which were scheduled to mature may  lines of credit 
we have a million line of credit that is available for regular borrowings and letter of credit transactions 
this line of credit is secured by one of our properties 
there were no regular borrowings outstanding under this line at december  and at december   a letter of credit in the amount of  had been issued against this line 
the interest rate on this line is libor plus or the one month reference rate and it matures december we also have a million secured line of credit that is available for regular borrowings which is secured by one of our properties 
this line was unavailable at december   because the property securing that credit line had been sold 
in february  we identified a replacement property to serve as security for this credit line and amended the loan terms by increasing the credit line to million from million with interest calculated at libor plus 
this line matures march  borrowings under the line may be restricted based upon the operating performance of the property 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this line at december  and shelf availability 
we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission relating to a possible offering  from time to time  of debt securities  preferred shares  depositary shares  common shares and common share warrants 
in december  we issued million of class b series ii cumulative redeemable preferred shares under this registration statement 
the remaining availability under the shelf registration at december  is million 
currently  we do not have access to issue debt securities under this shelf registration 
liquidity normal business operations 
we anticipate that we will meet our business operations and liquidity requirements for the upcoming year generally through net cash provided by operations 
we believe that if net cash provided by operations is below projections  other sources  such as secured borrowings primarily the lines of credit  unsecured borrowings  and property sales proceeds are available and should be sufficient to meet operating requirements  capital additions  mortgage amortization payments and the payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements 
liquidity non operational activities 
sources of cash available for paying down debt  acquiring properties or buying back our shares include the net proceeds from the sale of properties and the issuance of shares 
although we intend to sell between million and million of properties in  market conditions and other factors may adversely impact our ability to execute such sales

additionally  on january   we declared a quarterly dividend of per depositary share on our class b cumulative redeemable preferred shares  which will be paid on march   to shareholders of record on march  capital expenditures 
we anticipate incurring approximately million in capital expenditures for this includes replacement of worn carpet and appliances  parking lots  roofs and similar items in accordance with our current property expenditure plan  as well as commitments for investment revenue enhancing and non recurring expenditures 
these commitments are expected to be funded largely with cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from property sales 
financing and other commitments 
the following table identifies our total debt outstanding and weighted average interest rates as of december  and weighted weighted balance average balance average outstanding interest outstanding interest december  rate december  rate fixed rate debt mortgages payable cmbs   mortgages payable other  unsecured borrowing   total fixed rate debt   variable rate debt mortgages payable   lines of credit borrowings total variable rate debt   total debt   during  we defeased prepaid mortgage loans totaling million 
of these loans  ten fixed rate loans and one variable rate loan were prepaid with the proceeds received from property sales  and five fixed rate loans and three variable rate loans were prepaid with the proceeds of a million mortgage refinancing involving five properties 
the new loans are structured as five separate loans  however  each loan is cross collateralized  cross defaulted  and includes a collateral substitution feature 
at december   we had unencumbered properties  of which are affordable housing properties 
these properties had net income of million for the year ended december   and a net book value of million at december  we believe that we would be able to obtain financing on these properties should the need arise  however  financing may be restricted on ground leased properties and the property subject to a right of reverter because of their finite remaining terms see discussion below 
five of these unencumbered properties are scheduled for disposition during additionally  in january  we unencumbered one additional asset by defeasing prepaying the mortgage secured by that property 
we lease certain equipment and facilities under operating leases 
future minimum lease payments under all noncancellable operating leases in which we are the lessee  principally for ground leases  are included in the previous table of contractual obligations 
the ground lease agreements contain provisions which  upon expiration of the lease  require reversion of the land and building to the lessor 
such provisions exist for seven properties at december  these ground leases expire at various dates from to in september  we sold one property that was subject to a ground lease with a term expiring in total revenue derived from such properties were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
furthermore  at the end of the term of each lease  any remaining replacement reserves revert to the lessor 
such cash reserves included in restricted cash were  and  at december  and  respectively 
with respect to such leases  we paid ground rent of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we own one property which is subject to a right of reverter 
this provision requires that the land and real estate assets revert at expiration back to the original grantor from whom we acquired this property or its successors and assignees  which is in september the net book value of this property was  at december  this property generated revenue and net income of  and  for   and  for   and  for guarantees 
we routinely guaranty mortgage debt of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
additionally  we had one guaranty at december   related to a mortgage loan secured by one of our joint venture properties 
for further information on this guaranty  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
in the normal course of business  we may enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of aerc or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  payments made related to these indemnifications have not been material 
off balance sheet investments and financing commitments 
we have investments in two joint ventures that each own one multifamily apartment community 
one of these properties is a market rate property and the other property is an affordable housing property 
the operations of these properties are similar to the operations of our wholly owned portfolio 
these investments enable us to exercise influence over the operations of the properties and share in their profits  while earning additional fee income 
we account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence  but do not control these entities and are not required to consolidate them in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities or under eitf  investor s accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights 
these investments are initially recorded at cost  as investments in joint ventures and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
the affordable housing joint venture property had negative cash flow during and is expected to have negative cash flow during as a result of operating expenses exceeding the housing assistance payments from hud 
we are pursuing a request for an increase in housing assistance payments in order to address the deficit 
the joint venture partnership that owns this property intends to sell it 
additional cash contributions that may be required of us to pay deficits  if any  are not expected to be material 
we have one guaranty obligation related to our joint ventures which was previously discussed under guarantees 
both of these joint venture properties were encumbered by debt at december  our proportionate share of this debt was million 
for summarized financial information for these joint ventures  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
operating partnership 
as provided in the aerc hp investors limited partnership agreement downreit partnership  we  as general partner  have guaranteed the obligation of the downreit partnership to redeem op units held by the limited partners 
the downreit partnership was formed in under the terms of the downreit partnership agreement  the downreit partnership is obligated to redeem op units for our common shares or cash  at our discretion  at a price per op unit equal to the day trailing price of our common shares for the immediate day period preceding a limited partner s redemption notice 
during  we redeemed  op units 
as of december   there were  op units remaining having a carrying value of million  and  of the original  op units had been redeemed 
these transactions had the effect of increasing our interest in the downreit partnership from to 
in january  we redeemed an additional units 
for additional information regarding the op units  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
acquisitions and development 
we intend to continue to evaluate potential property acquisitions in higher growth markets that we previously identified 
any future property acquisitions or developments would be financed with the most appropriate sources of capital  which may include the assumption of mortgage indebtedness  bank and other institutional borrowings  the exchange of properties  undistributed earnings  secured or unsecured debt financings  or the issuance of shares or units exchangeable into common shares 
during  we acquired a unit market rate property located in atlanta  georgia  and a unit market rate property located in west palm beach  florida 
the purchases were funded primarily by mortgage financing on the acquired properties  mortgage funding on another market rate property  by cash received from property dispositions  and cash previously received through the issuance of trust preferred securities 
dispositions 
during  we sold eight properties seven market rate properties and one affordable housing property for net cash proceeds of million 
these proceeds were used primarily to defease prepay debt  repurchase million of our common shares and partially fund capital expenditures 
the operating results of these properties  along with the gains of million that we recognized  are included in income from discontinued operations 
during  we sold three market rate properties for net cash proceeds of million 
these proceeds were used primarily in the acquisition of two properties in  to repay borrowings on our line of credit and to defease prepay debt during the first quarter of additionally  we classified one property as held for sale at december  this property was sold on february  we tested this property for impairment under sfas and determined that it was not impaired 
the results of operations for this property are included in income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
additionally  the major classes of assets and liabilities related to this property have been reclassified as such in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  management and service operations 
concurrently with the sale of an affordable housing property in september  we entered into a management contract with the buyer of the property to provide property management services for that property 
we anticipate a total of approximately  in annual fee revenue related to this property 
additionally  in january  we entered into a management contract for a property located in pennsylvania for which we anticipate receiving a total of approximately  in annual fee revenue

market rate properties represent wholly owned properties 
acquired disposed properties represent two acquired properties 
the results of operations for the property designated as held for sale at december   have been recorded in income from discontinued operations 
affordable housing properties represent properties subject to hud regulations 
during the to comparison period  operating income increased million primarily as a result of increased property revenue 
interest expense during this comparison period  however  increased due to million in costs recognized related to the defeasement prepayment of debt million of additional prepayments costs were recognized in income from discontinued operations  which was partially offset by reduced mortgage interest costs 
the increased interest expense resulted in an increase in the loss from continuing operations during this comparison period 
during the to comparison period  increases in real estate taxes and insurance expense  utilities expense  and amortization costs related to property acquisitions were greater than increases in property revenue  resulting in a decrease in operating income and an increase in the loss from continuing operations

property revenue is primarily impacted by a combination of rental rates  rent concessions and occupancy levels 
we measure these factors using indicators such as physical occupancy number of units occupied divided by total number of units  and average monthly net collected rent per unit gross potential rents less vacancies and concessions divided by total number of units 
this information is presented in the following table for the years ended december   and information for the years ended december  and reflect results based upon the operating properties and their respective segments as of december  for the year ended december  average monthly physical net collected occupancy rent per unit acquisitions dispositions  market rate affordable housing for the year ended december  average monthly physical net collected occupancy rent per unit acquisitions dispositions market rate affordable housing for the year ended december  average monthly physical net collected occupancy rent per unit acquisitions dispositions market rate affordable housing property revenue increased in compared to primarily as a result of increased rental revenue of million  million of which was contributed by the market rate properties 
the increase in market rate property rental revenue was primarily due to increased occupancy  increased rental rates and a reduction in concessions during additionally  the two properties acquired in contributed million in rental revenue during other property revenue increased million in compared to primarily as a result of our utility and refuse reimbursement programs  which increased a total of million 
these programs were initiated in late and  and provided increasing revenue during their phase in period  leveling off in late other property revenue increased million in compared to primarily as a result of million of increases related to the utility and refuse reimbursement programs 
property revenue for the affordable housing properties increased  in compared to and  in compared to primarily as a result of hud approved rent increases during and the revenue is primarily dependent upon the receipt of rental assistance subsidies from hud via monthly housing assistance payments hap payments 
the amount of each monthly hap payment is equal to the rent amount the contract rent stated in the hap contract with hud  less the amount payable by the eligible resident for such month 
below is a table setting forth the expiration dates of the hap contracts and the hap payments revenue recognized for our affordable housing properties as of december  in thousands final revenue recognized during property expiration date ellet december lakeshore village joint venture july puritas place september st 
james riverview november shaker park gardens ii june state road apartments december statesman ii november sutliff apartments november tallmadge acres march twinsburg apartments june village towers november west high apartments november amounts shown represent payment 
the eleven wholly owned properties shown in the above table had positive cash flow during and are anticipated to have positive cash flow for the remaining contract terms 
therefore  none of these hap contracts are considered to be loss contracts 
lakeshore village had negative cash flow during as a result of increased operating expenditures related to increased repairs and maintenance expenses that exceeded the mark to market modeled expectations 
we intend to continue to pursue a request for a budget based increase in monthly hap payments sufficient to support a positive cash flow at this property 
we anticipate that additional cash requirements resulting from the negative cash flow  if any  will be funded by us and our joint venture partner 
such funding requirements are not expected to be material obligations 
due to the increase in cash requirements resulting from negative cash flow coupled with the uncertainty of increased hap funding  the partnership that owns this property is marketing it for sale 
contract rents may be adjusted at least annually in accordance with the annual adjustment factor method for some of the properties 
generally  these types of adjustments are only permitted if current rents are below the hud published fair market rent fmr threshold 
if current rents exceed fmrs  a rent comparability study must be completed to demonstrate that the property s rents are below market 
contract renewal request forms must be submitted to hud or its corresponding contract agent not less than days prior to the applicable hap anniversary date in order to renew an existing hap contract 
we understand that the following options are available to us for expiring hap contracts i for properties without mortgages  we may renew at current rents plus an operating cost adjustment factor ocaf that is set by hud on an annual basis  ii for properties encumbered by a mortgage  we may renew at the lesser of x current rents plus an ocaf or y comparable market rents  or  iii opt out of the section program 
opting out of the section program requires an additional one year notice to hud or the contract agent and the affected residents 
we believe  that upon expiration of the contracts  the contracts will be renewed  or we will enter into another government subsidized or mortgage restructuring program 
the following represents our current expectations concerning those hap contracts that expire in and shaker park gardens ii 
in april  we requested a renewal of the current contract for a one year term with a budget based rent increase of 
hud denied our request 
subsequently we applied for a increase  as calculated using the ocaf published on october  our request for an ocaf increase was granted and the contract was renewed for a one year term through june  we intend to request a renewal in march for an additional one year period

in july  we requested a renewal of the current contract for a one year term with an increase in rents of  as calculated using the ocaf published on october  our request for an ocaf increase was granted and the contract was renewed for a one year term through november  prior to expiration of the current contract  we intend to request a renewal for an additional one year period 
fees  reimbursements and other 
fee revenue for the management and service operations decreased  during compared to primarily as a result of a reduction in the number of properties that we manage for clients 
in  four managed properties were sold  one property was transferred to another advisor  and we purchased our joint venture partners share of one property 
disposition fees were recognized in related to two of these property sales 
management and advisory fees attributed to properties owned by non affiliated third party owners and advisory clients are earned pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable upon days notice 
painting service revenue and expenses 
painting service revenue and expenses both decreased in compared to primarily as a result of contracts that were entered into by our subsidiary  merit painting services in and work related to these contracts was completed during property operating and maintenance expenses 
property operating and maintenance expenses increased when comparing to primarily as a result of real estate tax expense  personnel expense  and repairs and maintenance expense 
the increase in real estate taxes was primarily due to assessed property value and millage rate increases and a decrease in refunds received related to prior year taxes 
the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was primarily due to increases in maintenance project costs  unit preparation costs  landscaping costs  and trash removal costs 
property operating and maintenance expenses increased when comparing to primarily as a result of real estate tax expense  utilities expense  and personnel expense 
the increase in real estate taxes was primarily due to assessed property value and millage rate increases that resulted in million in additional expense in and an ohio tax law change that resulted in an increase of approximately  in this law was signed june   and became effective july   retroactive to january  utilities increased primarily due to increased consumption and cost per unit of natural gas and an increase in water and sewer rates in compared to interest expense 
interest expense increased in compared to primarily due to million in costs recognized related to the prepayment  primarily through defeasance  of mortgage loans the costs related to four additional loan prepayments are included in income from discontinued operations below 
interest expense increased in compared to primarily due to increased borrowings  primarily the million of unsecured debt obtained in march  and mortgage loans obtained on the two properties acquired during depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased in compared to primarily as a result of the acquisition of one property in july  one property in march  and one property in october and the completion of major renovation work at one of our properties in late general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased when comparing to primarily due to salary  benefit and share based payment costs and an increase of  in directors compensation  primarily as a result of valuation adjustments in deferred compensation based on common share units which are valued using the closing price of our common shares at the end of each period 
additionally  we recorded an estimated loss contingency in connection with the out of court settlement reached with montgomery county  maryland 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
income from discontinued operations 
included in discontinued operations for the years ended december    and  are the operating results and the gains related to eight wholly owned properties that were sold in  three wholly owned properties that were sold in and one wholly owned property that was sold in the decrease in operating income from discontinued operations in compared to was primarily due to costs incurred to defease four loans that were secured by the properties that were sold 
for further details on income from discontinued operations  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
inflation 
it is our belief that the effects of inflation would be minimal on the operational performance of our portfolio as a result of the short term nature of our leases which are typically for terms of one year or less 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include accounts of all subsidiaries  the service companies and the operating partnership structured as a downreit 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have utilized information available including industry practice and our own past history in forming estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome that we anticipated in formulating the estimates inherent in these consolidated financial statements may not materialize 
however  application of the accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
in performing this analysis  we estimate holding periods of the assets  changes in fair market value of the assets and cash flows related to the operations of the assets to determine the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives under consideration by management 
should the estimates used to determine alternatives or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  an impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to review goodwill annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
in performing this analysis  we use a multiple of revenues to the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives we consider 
should estimates used to determine the alternatives considered or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  an impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
sfas no 
r  share based payment  requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options awarded 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options  which requires the use of judgement and or estimates in determining certain of the assumptions used by this model 
if we had used different judgement and or estimates  a different valuation would have been produced that may have resulted in a material change to our results of operations 
sfas no 
r also requires us to estimate future performance results related to certain share based awards 
if the results vary from our estimate it may require us to make a material adjustment to our results of operations 
we estimate the amount of real estate taxes for which we will be liable based upon assumptions relating to possible changes in millage rates and property value reassessments 
in certain circumstances  it is possible that the actual millage rates or reassessment values are not available until the following reporting period and that these rates or values could differ from assumptions and require material adjustments to the liabilities recorded 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of variable rate mortgage debt 
additionally  we have interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity 
we have and will continue to manage interest rate risk as follows i maintain what we believe to be a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  ii consider hedges for certain long term variable and or fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  and iii consider the use of treasury locks where appropriate to hedge rates on anticipated debt transactions 
we use various financial models and advisors to assist us in analyzing opportunities to achieve those objectives
