item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat patients with cancer and adjacent diseases 
we operate in three business segments products  royalties and contract manufacturing 
our hospital and oncology sales forces market abelcet  oncaspar  adagen  and depocyt in the united states 
in addition  we receive royalties on sales of peg intron  marketed by schering plough corporation  and macugen  marketed by osi pharmaceuticals and pfizer inc royalties are derived through others application of our proprietary pegylation technology to their products 
pegylation is a proven means of enabling or enhancing the performance of pharmaceuticals with delivery limitations through the chemical attachment of polyethylene glycol or peg 
our product driven strategy includes an extensive drug development program that leverages our proprietary technologies  including a customized linker technology tm pegylation platform that utilizes customized linkers designed to release compounds at a controlled rate 
we complement our internal research and development efforts with strategic initiatives  such as partnerships designed to broaden our revenue base or provide access to promising new technologies or product development opportunities 
we also engage in opportunities with third parties to improve our efficiency 
effective december   we changed our fiscal year end from june to december accordingly  the discussion that follows relates to the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december   the six months ended december  and the fiscal years ended june  and in order to provide bases for analysis of trends and rates of growth  prior period information for the calendar year and the six months ended december  were compiled from our financial information previously reported on our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended september   december  and march   our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  and our transition report on form k for the six months ended december  quarterly data were not audited 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and  six months ended december  and and fiscal years ended june  and summary level overview twelve months ended december  compared to total revenues rose million for the year ended december  to million from million in the largest component of total revenues is product sales which grew by in the year ended december  from million to million 
total revenues reflect four full quarters of royalties in versus approximately three quarters in contributing to a higher increase than actual growth in royalty activity 
there was a one quarter deferral of royalty revenue recognition in as we improved our estimation process 
net income loss for the year ended december  was million or per share on a diluted per share basis as compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share for our financial results in were significantly impacted by the write down of intangible assets and goodwill  and establishment of allowances against deferred tax assets 
the one quarter deferral in royalty revenue recognition in also affected comparisons of operating results 
further discussion of these revenue and profitability fluctuations is contained in the segment analyses and prior period analyses that follow 
following is a reconciliation of segment profitability to consolidated income loss before income tax millions of dollars

the continued decline in sales of abelcet  our intravenous antifungal product  was more than offset by growth in our other products 
sales of our lead oncology agent  oncaspar  grew to million or for the year ended december  compared to million for the twelve month period ended december  the growth of oncaspar is mainly attributable to its continued adoption in certain protocols by hospitals and cooperative groups 
on july   we announced the approval of oncaspar for the first line treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia all 
adagen  for the treatment of severe combined immuno deficiency disease  experienced growth in sales of from million in to million in the increase was primarily the result of a newly negotiated contract with our distributor and the distributor s establishment during the fourth quarter of of inventory levels in line with industry norms 
sales of depocyt  for treatment of lymphomatous meningitis  increased to million in from million last year due to pricing 
skyepharma  our partner for depocyt  has responsibility for the conduct of post marketing studies for depocyt  the success of which could impact our future sales 
in the second quarter of  skyepharma submitted such a study to the us food and drug administration 
abelcet sales in the us and canada declined for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in the face of continued competition from current and newly launched therapeutics in the anti fungal market 

table of contents for the six months ended december   net product sales decreased by to million over the same period of as growth in the other products could not overcome the decline in us and canadian sales of abelcet 
the abelcet sales decline was due to competitive market conditions from both other lipid amphotericin b products and other classes of antifungal products 
during the six months ended december   us and canadian abelcet sales were down million or as compared to the six months ended december  driven mainly by a reduction in volume 
the million or increase in revenue for oncaspar was related to the adoption of oncaspar in certain protocols by hospitals and cooperative groups resulting in an increase in demand for the product as well as the effect of a price increase in december the growth in adagen sales for the six months ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily driven by an increase in volume over the prior year  as well as a higher weighted average price 
depocyt net sales were slightly higher in the six months ended december  compared to the same prior year period due primarily to increased use by neuro oncologists because of its more convenient dosing schedule as compared to the native forms of l asparaginase 
net product sales for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by to million from the year earlier 
the decrease in net product sales was attributable to a decline in us and canadian sales of abelcet due to continued competitive market conditions 
during the year ended june   us and canadian abelcet sales declined from the prior fiscal year to million 
oncaspar net sales increased to million for the year ended june   from million in the twelve month period ended june  due primarily to a higher weighted average price 
adagen net sales were million  up over the fiscal year ended june  the growth in adagen sales for the fiscal year ended june  was driven in part by an increase in the volume over the prior year  as well as a higher weighted average price 
depocyt net sales were million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  due primarily to increased demand  which reflected more focused sales and marketing efforts  and to a lesser extent a higher weighted average price 
we continue to focus on our four marketed brands  abelcet  oncaspar  adagen and depocyt and expanding their market potential through new initiatives 
despite our efforts  us and canadian sales of abelcet may continue to be negatively affected by the continued competitive conditions in the antifungal market due to the introduction of newer agents from pfizer  merck  astellas and schering plough 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to support our products will be successful or that any particular sales levels of abelcet  oncaspar  adagen or depocyt will be achieved or maintained 
cost of sales cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales of  remained relatively stable overall in the year ended december  on a year over year basis 
oncaspar royalty costs were significantly reduced in resulting in a million reduction due to the january  negotiated lowering of royalties with sanofi aventis 
offsetting this  in part  was a million increase in amortization resulting from the intangible that arose from the million payment made to sanofi aventis in connection with the royalty reduction 
some inventory write offs were also experienced in relation to oncaspar  but other production costs were lower as a percent of sales resulting in a net improvement in margins for the product 
abelcet costs were favorably affected by the december write down of related intangibles and the consequent lowering of amortization expense in as compared to also  abelcet inventory write off losses experienced in were not repeated in these improvements in abelcet cost of sales were largely offset by erosion of margins in adagen due to the write off of certain batch failures 
depocyt margins remained relatively unchanged 
in february  our board of directors approved a plan to consolidate our manufacturing operations in indianapolis  indiana from our south plainfield  new jersey facility 
we expect this consolidation to take approximately one year and that this change will help streamline operations and eliminate certain redundancies 
we expect total charges for this restructuring of between million and million associated with the transition in  and a write off of an estimated million related to the leased facility in cost of sales of marketed products for the six months ended december  was of sales compared to of sales for the comparable six month period of the lower margin earned in the period ended 
table of contents december  was due mainly to an increase in abelcet production costs as a result of negative absorption variances arising from low production volumes 
for the year ended june   cost of sales was of sales 
this was slightly higher  than the of sales experienced for the year ended june  the percentage increase was attributable to inventory write offs as well as increased capacity costs 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our sales and marketing personnel  as well as other commercial expenses and marketing programs to support our sales force 
the aggregate spending on selling and marketing expense of million during the year ended december  remained relatively constant compared to million in the same period of spending in shifted somewhat from traditional advertising and promotion experienced in to more training and education 
a medical science liaison function was established in oncaspar expansion due to the first line approval for all announced in july was a key focus 
we also supported a repositioning of abelcet during the year 
selling and marketing expenses for the six months ended december  decreased to million  as compared to million for the six months ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the timing of our investments in sales and marketing programs  the absence of spending related to the marqibo project cancelled in march and the modified approach to selling in canada 
selling and marketing expenses for the year ended june  increased to million  as compared to million the year earlier 
the increase in sales and marketing costs was attributable to our oncology sales operations  premarketing expenses regarding marqibo and our hospital based sales operations 
research and development expenses our existing marketed products are in the later stages of their respective life cycles 
for this reason  research and development spending related to marketed products has been directed largely towards securing and maintaining a reliable supply of the ingredients used in their production primarily in the production of oncaspar and adagen 
beginning in the latter half of  we accelerated efforts to study the potential of oncaspar in treating solid tumors and lymphomas 
in august  we initiated a phase i clinical trial of oncaspar to assure its safety and potential utility in the treatment of advanced solid tumors and lymphomas in combination therapy 
research and development spending on marketed products is expected to continue 
product specific research and development spending prior to was immaterial 
amortization of acquired intangibles amortization expense is principally related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the abelcet acquisition in november during the quarter ended december   the company recognized an impairment write down of nearly all of these assets amounting to million see below 
this write down significally reduced periodic amortization expense in the year ended december  to million from million in the twelve months ended december  amortization in periods prior to the impairment was relatively consistent approximately million per six month period and million for twelve months 
write down of goodwill and intangibles the majority of our intangible assets prior to had been acquired in november with the acquisition of abelcet 
by late and into  abelcet sales had declined from historical levels and a long term strategic plan completed in november indicated that it was unlikely sales would recover to prior levels 
in light of this impairment indicator  we engaged an independent valuation specialist to determine the fair value of the abelcet asset group and test for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
initial testing disclosed that the future 
table of contents undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset group were insufficient to cover the carrying value of the abelcet related intangibles 
the fair value of these intangible assets was then calculated and a non cash impairment charge was recognized in the products segment for the excess of carrying amount over fair value in the aggregate amount of million during the six months ended december  effective in the quarter ended december   we changed the manner in which we manage and evaluate the performance of our operations which resulted in a change to our business segmentation and the identification of our related reporting units 
this new segmentation necessitated the allocation of our existing goodwill to the newly identified reporting units on a relative fair value basis 
further  we considered the historical declining performance of the abelcet products and the impairment recognized of the related intangible assets to be indicators that our products segment goodwill may be impaired 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to perform a valuation of our reporting units  to assist us with the allocation of our goodwill and estimate the fair value of assets using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the allocation process resulted in the products segment being assigned million of goodwill 
the ensuing testing to estimate the implied fair value of this goodwill disclosed that it was impaired in its entirety 
accordingly  a non cash impairment loss related to goodwill was recorded in the amount of million in the products segment during the six months ended december  royalties segment year ended six months ended fiscal year ended december december december december june june change change change millions of dollars total royalty revenues nm nm nm not meaningful the majority of total royalties is comprised of royalty revenue we receive on sales of peg intron  a peg enhanced version of schering plough s alpha interferon product  intron a  which is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
total royalties also include other royalty revenue and certain license revenues related to the application of our technology to other firms products 
for example  under an agreement we have with nektar therapeutics  inc nektar  osi pharmaceuticals has sublicensed our pegylation technology for use in macugen for the treatment of neovascular wet age related macular degeneration  an eye disease associated with aging that destroys central vision 
we receive a share of the royalties nektar receives from osi pharmaceuticals 
our ability to reasonably estimate our royalty revenue as products are sold by licensees was reevaluated in december as we observed greater volatility that had arisen as a result of expansion in the number of products sold by licensees  the entry of licensees into new geographic territories and the effects of competition on the licensees net sales 
as royalties constitute a material component of our total revenues and as the timeline for reporting of financial information has become shorter  the need for improved estimating procedures became essential 
we concluded in december that we could no longer reasonably estimate royalty income that we have earned but that has not yet been communicated by the third party licensee 
we recognize royalty revenue when it is reasonably determinable and collection is reasonably assured  which beginning with the quarter ended december   was the notification from the third party licensee of the royalties earned under the license agreement 
this information is generally received from the licensees in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the sales occur 
the one quarter deferral of royalty revenue recognition in had no effect on our cash flow 
assessing the year over year rate of growth of royalty revenues between the twelve months ended december  and is difficult due to a one quarter deferral of royalty revenue recognition that took place in december much of the increase is attributable to the fact that we are comparing three quarters of activity in with four quarters in although underlying product sales did rise 
in  peg intron sales continued to grow as a result of its launch in japan 
however  as anticipated  schering plough reported a decline in peg intron sales in japan in the fourth quarter of  as new patient enrollment moderates 
macugen  also as anticipated  experienced significant competition from a newly approved agent 

table of contents because of the royalty revenue recognition change  the six month period ended december  represents essentially just one quarter s royalty revenues 
this is principally the royalty received on the sales that occurred during the quarter ended september  of peg intron 
the amount of total royalties reported in the quarter ended september  was million 
the additional total royalties reported for the six months ended december  of million includes fees associated with the discontinuation of our research collaboration with micromet 
total royalties for the year ended june  increased to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  the improvement in total royalties over the prior year was due to the january launch of macugen in the us and the december launch of peg intron combination therapy in japan 
the future revenues to be received from the use of our technology are dependent upon numerous factors outside of our control such as competition and the effectiveness of marketing by our licensees 
macugen has been experiencing competition in the us and  as noted above  sales of peg intron in japan will face increased competition 
costs and expenses current royalty revenues do not require any material specific maintenance costs 
at some point in the future  costs associated with initiation of new outlicensing agreements that could result in our receipt of a royalty stream and  if necessary  costs necessary to maintain the underlying technology may be charged to the royalties segment 
contract manufacturing segment contract manufacturing revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from the manufacture of myocet and abelcet for the european market  and to a lesser extent  the manufacture of an injectable multivitamin  mvi  for mayne pharma  ltd  a division of hospira  inc our contract manufacturing revenue commenced in november  when we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement for the manufacture of myocet and abelcet for the european market in connection with our acquisition of the us and canadian abelcet business

abelcet international revenues were down  in part  due to declining demand but also due to a billing adjustment related to two contracts that resulted in a reduction of million 
two new contract manufacturing agreements entered into near the end of the year have not yet had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
contract manufacturing revenue for the six months ended december  was million compared to million for the comparable period of the decrease in contract manufacturing revenue was attributable to the timing of sales of mvi offset partially by an increase in sales of abelcet to the european market 
contract manufacturing revenue for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended june  the increase in contract manufacturing revenue in fiscal year june was due to an increase in volume 

table of contents cost of sales cost of sales for contract manufacturing was approximately of sales in the year ended december  compared to in the same period of with the increase due principally to the adverse effect of the above mentioned billing adjustment of million 
cost of sales for contract manufacturing for the six months ended december  was million or of sales 
this compared to million or of sales for the comparable six month period of the increase in cost as a percent of sales was attributable to lower production volumes in which resulted in a proportionate increase in fixed costs being allocated to the units produced 
cost of sales for the contract manufacturing segment  as a percentage of net contract manufacturing revenue  decreased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  the decrease was attributable to reduced capacity costs 
write down of goodwill in the six month period ended december   the contract manufacturing segment was allocated million of goodwill in connection with the redefinition of segments described above in the products segment 
a similar test  as described above  for impairment disclosed that the full amount of goodwill allocated to contract manufacturing was impaired and  accordingly  was written off 
non us revenue we had export sales and royalties recognized on export sales of million for the year ended december   million for the six months ended december   million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  of these amounts  sales in europe and royalties recognized on sales in europe  were million  million  million and million for the year ended december   six months ended december  and the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively

our research and development expense is considered a corporate expense until a product candidate enters phase iii clinical trials at which time related costs would be chargeable to one of our operating segments 
the significant increase in research and development spending during the year ended december  reflects a number of key initiatives undertaken to expand and improve our product pipeline 
expenditures rose from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  included in the amount was a million payment to inex pharmaceuticals corporation related to the termination of our partnership for the development of the oncology product marqibo 
excluding these costs from the comparison  the underlying growth in research and development spending year over year was even more significant 
investigational new drug ind applications were filed during relating to recombinant human mannose binding lectin and the hif alpha antagonist for solid tumors 
the clinical trials underlying these and other research efforts accounted for much of the increased spending in in addition  the ind filing in december related to hif alpha which filing was approved by the fda in january triggered a million license milestone payment to santaris pharma a s 
this amount was recorded in research and development expense in one additional ind was filed during the costs associated with this have been included in the products segment as it relates to oncaspar 
we anticipate filing an additional one or two inds in as well as commencing clinical trials for our hif alpha antagonist and peg sn corporate research and development expenses decreased to million for the six months ended december   as compared to million for the six months ended december  the decrease was attributable to decreased costs related to the march termination of further development of marqibo of approximately million  as well as decreased spending of million related to clinical and preclinical development programs  which was primarily attributable to the termination of our clinical development programs and million related to personnel related expenses 
offsetting these declines  in part  were increased costs of million related to the micromet termination agreement 
corporate research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was attributable to increased costs related to marqibo  which included the impact of a million payment related to the termination of our partnership with inex  as well as increased personnel related expenses 
these increases were offset in part by decreased spending related to clinical and preclinical development programs  which was primarily attributable to the termination of our clinical development program for pegamotecan 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for support functions  outside professional services for accounting  audit  tax  legal  and financing activities  and allocations of facilities costs 
general and administrative expenses rose million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is mainly attributable to million in legal costs incurred in the fourth quarter of in connection with securing the supply of the raw material used to produce oncaspar 
in addition  the earnings impact resulting from the july  adoption of share based compensation rules was felt most heavily in general and administrative expenses due to the recognition of executive and director compensation principally in this classification 
not only were the new accounting rules effective for a full twelve months of versus just six months in  the measure of share based compensation rises each year for the first few years after adoption as amortization of additional grants are layered into the computations 
for the six months ended december   general and administrative expenses amounted to million compared to million for the six months ended december  the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased accounting and related fees associated with our sarbanes oxley act 
table of contents compliance activities related in part to the change in fiscal year 
in addition  there was an increase in personnel related costs  including employee search fees and relocation expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased accounting and related fees associated with our sarbanes oxley act compliance activities  as well as an increase in personnel related costs  including employee search fees and relocation expenses 
write down of carrying value of investment during the year ended june   we recorded a write down of the carrying value of our investment in micromet that resulted in a non cash charge of million 
in april  we entered into an agreement with micromet related to antibody based therapeutics 
in connection with this agreement  we made an million investment in micromet in the form of a note payable to us that was convertible into micromet common stock at the election of either party 
our decision to write down the note was based on a decline in the estimated fair value of this investment that was deemed to be other than temporary 
subsequently  in november  we terminated our research collaboration and converted the note into common shares of micromet 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development for the year ended december  was comprised of payments totaling million to santaris pharma a s for rights to a total of eight rna antagonists based on lna locked nucleic acid technology 
acquired in process research and development of million for the twelve months ended december  as well as for the six months ended december   was attributable to the execution of a license agreement with natimmune in september for the clinical development of recombinant human mannose binding lectin 
acquired in process research and development for the year ended june  was million  attributable to an up front payment that we made to inex related to the execution of a partnership for the clinical development of marqibo 
as each of these technologies were in the developmental stage at the time of acquisition  the payments were charged to operations 
restructuring charge during the year ended june   we incurred charges totaling million pertaining to a realignment of our costs through a restructuring 
this decision was based on the aforementioned increasingly competitive conditions in the intravenous antifungal market affecting abelcet  as well as the discontinuation of certain research and development projects 
the charges were primarily attributable to employee termination benefits 
other income expense other income expense for the year ended december  netted to income of million as compared to net other expense in the comparable period of of million 
the refinancing of a significant portion of our long term debt in affected the year to year comparisons in a number of manners refer to liquidity and capital resources below 
other income expense for the six months ended december   the six months ended december   and the year ended june  was an expense of million  million and million  respectively  as compared to income of million for the year ended june  interest expense rose during the year ended december  due primarily to the write off of million of deferred offering costs in connection with the repurchase of a portion of our notes 
interest expense related to the convertible subordinated notes was million for the six months ended december   million for the six months ended december  and million for each of the years ended june  and net investment income for the year ended december  increased year over year due to a gain of million realized in on the sale of our remaining  shares of nektar common stock 
in addition  we had more investments outstanding in at higher interest rates than in the same period of net investment income for the six months ended december  increased by million to million  as 
table of contents compared to million for the six months ended december  this increase was principally due to the increase in interest income from our interest bearing investments 
net investment income for the year ended june  decreased by million to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  this decrease was principally due to the sale of  shares of nektar therapeutics common stock that resulted in the net gain of approximately million  recorded during the year ended june  this decrease in investment income was partially offset by a million increase in interest income for the year ended june   as compared to the year ended june  concurrent with the issuance of new notes due  we used a portion of the proceeds to repurchase million principal amount of notes due outstanding at a purchase price of million resulting in a gain of million reflected in other  net 
during the twelve months ended december   we realized a loss of million related to the sale of nps pharmaceuticals nps common stock we received under a june merger termination agreement and a financial instrument we entered into to reduce our exposure to the change in fair value associated with such shares  specifically a zero cost protective collar arrangement the collar 
for the six months ended december   other  net was an expense of million compared to an expense of million for the comparable prior year period 
during each of the six month periods ended december  and  we sold  shares of nps common stock and  shares of the collar instrument matured 
this resulted in the recognition of losses of million and million as components of other income expense for each of the six month periods  respectively 
for the year ended june   other  net was an expense of million  as compared to income of million for the year ended june  during the year ended june   we realized a loss of million related to the sale and repurchase of  shares of nps common stock  an unrealized gain of million related to change in the fair value of the collar  and a realized loss of million related to the maturation of a portion of the collar and the sale of the underlying shares 
these amounts were partially offset by other miscellaneous non operating income of million for the year ended june  during the year ended june   we recognized an unrealized gain of million related to the change in the fair value of our nps common stock  a realized gain of million related to the sale and repurchase of million shares of nps common stock  and an unrealized gain of million related to change in the fair value of the collar 
there was million of other miscellaneous non operating income for the year ended june  income taxes income tax expense of million for the year ended december  is comprised of certain state and canadian taxes 
no federal income tax expense was recorded due to the utilization of deferred tax assets 
no state net operating loss carry forwards were purchased or sold during for the twelve months ended december   the net income tax provision was million 
this was almost entirely the result of a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in june based on our assessment that it was not likely we would realize a future benefit from those assets 
for the six months ended december   we recognized a non cash net tax benefit of approximately million for federal and state purposes  as compared to a net tax benefit of million for the six months ended december  income tax benefit for the six months ended december  is primarily the result of the company s write off of goodwill 
a deferred tax liability had been accreting due to goodwill being amortized for tax purposes but not for books 
this deferred tax liability was converted into a deferred tax asset against which a valuation allowance was established 
also  during the six months ended december   we sold approximately million of our state net operating loss carryforwards not expected to be useable by us for proceeds of million which was recorded as a tax benefit and we recorded state tax expense of million and foreign tax expense of million 
during the year ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million  which represents a full reserve against our existing net deferred tax assets of million  a deferred tax liability charge of million associated with our goodwill  as well as a million income tax provision for the twelve months ended june  
table of contents this charge was determined based on our assessment of the likelihood that we will benefit from these assets 
realizing a benefit is ultimately dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax benefits that are recognized as deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
based on an analysis of the continued decline in our abelcet revenues  coupled with projected continuing funding of research and development  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the tax benefits attributable to our deferred tax assets 
income tax expense for the year ended june  of million is comprised of a tax provision for income taxes payable and a charge of million primarily related to an increase in our valuation allowance for certain research and development tax credits and capital losses based on our assessment that it was not more likely than not that we would be able to utilize these assets 
during the year ended june   we sold approximately million of our state net operating loss carryforwards for proceeds of million which was recorded as a tax benefit and we purchased approximately million of gross state net operating loss carryforwards for million 
liquidity and capital resources total cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities  were million as of december  as compared to million as of december  positive operating cash flows for the year ended december  and cash proceeds of million from the sale of nektar common stock contributed to the increase in cash reserves 
partially offsetting these cash inflows was the january payment to sanofi aventis of million relating to a reduction of the oncaspar royalty rate and the million payment to santaris for their technology rights 
not yet reflected as a reduction to the december  cash balance are the million committed payment to ovation under the december supply and license agreement  the million hif alpha antagonist milestone payment to santaris  and the million legal fees incurred in connection with securing the supply of the raw material used to produce oncaspar 
these payments occurred in the first quarter of within the overall rise in total cash reserves  cash and cash equivalents decreased million during the year ended december  while investments rose million 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the twelve months ended december  as compiled from previous reports on forms q and k 
the primary elements in the million improvement year over year were improved operating earnings plus net cash inflows relating to changes in operating assets and liabilities in compared to net cash out flows relating to operating assets in net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in in addition to investments in short term investments and marketable securities  we acquired million of property and equipment  million of in process research and development and million of product rights 
financing activities in provided a source of cash in the amount of million reflecting the net favorable effects of refinancing a portion of our long term debt as described below and million of stock option exercises 
in  the repurchase of notes payable used million of cash 
as of december   we had outstanding million of convertible senior notes payable that bear interest at an annual rate of and million of convertible subordinated notes payable that bear interest at an annual rate of 
interest is payable on june and december for the notes and january and july for the notes 
accrued interest on the notes was million and million  respectively as of december  and the second quarter issuance of the notes generated million of gross financing cash inflows million in may and million in june

for a more detailed description of the terms of our convertible subordinated notes see contractual obligations below 

table of contents our current sources of liquidity are our cash reserves  interest earned on such cash reserves  short term investments  marketable securities  sales of abelcet  oncaspar  adagen and depocyt  royalties earned  and contract manufacturing revenue 
based upon our current planned research and development activities and related costs and our current sources of liquidity  we anticipate our current cash reserves and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital and operational requirements for the near future  however we may refinance or seek new financing to meet the payments due upon maturity of our remaining convertible subordinated notes in we will likely seek additional financing  such as through future offerings of equity or debt securities or agreements with collaborators with respect to the development and commercialization of products  to fund future operations  debt retirement and potential acquisitions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
see risk factors we will need to obtain additional financing to meet our future capital needs and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spe  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes

our convertible notes are payable on july  and our convertible notes are payable on june  critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards effective as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates  to the extent possible  on historical experience 
historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenues revenues from product sales and contract manufacturing revenue are recognized when title passes to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
for product sales we also record a provision at the time of shipment for estimated future credits  chargebacks  sales discounts  rebates and returns 
these sales provision accruals  except for rebates which are recorded as a liability  are presented as a reduction of the accounts receivable balances 
we continually monitor the adequacy of the accruals by comparing the actual payments to the estimates used in establishing the accruals 
effective january   we changed our third party distributor for three of our four products abelcet  oncaspar and depocyt 
for abelcet  our new third party distributor ships product to the same wholesalers as prior to the change 
we continue to recognize revenues for abelcet at the time of sale to the wholesaler 
the distribution process for oncaspar and depocyt has changed 
sales are recorded when oncaspar and depocyt are shipped by our new third party distributor directly to the end user 
we previously sold the products to a specialty distributor and recorded sales at that time 
adagen distribution remains unchanged in terms of timing of revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for adagen upon sale to the specialty distributor 
in addition to the new distributor handling the indicated products on our behalf  it administers certain billing and accounts receivable functions 
we provide chargeback payments to the wholesalers based on their sales to members of buying groups at prices determined under a contract between ourselves and the member 
administrative fees are paid to buying groups based on the total amount of purchases by their members 
we estimate the amount of the chargeback that will be paid using a distribution channel information obtained from certain of our wholesalers  which allows us to determine the amount and expiry of inventory in the distribution channel  and b historical trends  adjusted for current changes 
the settlement of the chargebacks generally occurs within three months after the sale to the wholesaler 
we regularly analyze the historical chargeback trends and make adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends 
in addition  state agencies that administer various programs  such as the us medicaid programs  receive rebates 
medicaid rebates and administrative fees are recorded as a liability and a reduction of gross sales when we record the sale of the product 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we use a channel information obtained from certain of our wholesalers  which allows us to determine the amount and expiry of inventory in the 
table of contents distribution channel  b our historical medicaid rebate and administrative fee payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales  and c as any significant changes in sales trends 
current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  and the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid patients are also evaluated 
factors that complicate the rebate calculations are the timing of the average manufacturer pricing computation  the lag time between sale and payment of a rebate  which can range up to nine months  and the level of reimbursement by state agencies 
the following is a summary of gross to net sales reductions that are accrued on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and in thousands december  december  accounts receivable reductions chargebacks cash discounts other including returns total accrued liabilities medicaid rebates administrative fees total grand total royalties under our license agreements with third parties are recognized when reasonably determinable and earned through the sale of the product by the licensee net of future credits  chargebacks  sales discount rebates and refunds and collection is reasonably assured 
notification from the third party licensee of the royalties earned under the license agreement is the basis for royalty revenue recognition 
this information is generally received from the licensees in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the sales occur 
non refundable milestone payments that represent the completion of a separate earnings process are recognized as revenue when earned  upon the occurrence of contract specified events and when the milestone has substance 
non refundable payments received upon entering into license and other collaborative agreements where we have continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
income taxes under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be not realized 
as of december   we believe that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets  including our net operating losses from operating activities and stock option exercises  will not be realized 
we recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if such tax position is probable of being sustained 
long lived asset impairment analysis long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this testing is performed when impairment indicators are present 
impairment indicators are events or circumstances that may be 
table of contents indicative of possible impairment such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  a current period operating loss combined with a history of operating losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
sfas no 
testing for the recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is performed initially by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the assets 
if the undiscounted net cash flow stream exceeds the carrying amount  no further analysis is required 
however  if this test shows a negative relationship  the fair value of the assets within the asset group must be determined and we would record an impairment charge for any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value 
these evaluations involve amounts and forecasts that are based on management s best estimates and judgment 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
share based payments effective july   we adopted sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements  measured by the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
until we have developed sufficient reliable information  we are using a peer group average for purposes of estimating forfeitures of share based payments 
as stratified data are developed  they will be compared to the initial average and the rate will be adjusted to actual 
the new rules had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share and we expect them to continue to have a material effect in future periods as future share based payments are charged to operating expense 
the impact such payments will have on our results of operations will be a function of the number of shares awarded  vesting and the trading price of our stock at date of grant 
in april  the board of directors accelerated the vesting of all of our out of the money unvested stock options awarded to officers  directors and employees and  in june  the board of directors accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options granted in may and june to company officers 
this acceleration may have resulted in our not having to recognize compensation expense in the year ended december  and the six months ended december  in the amounts of million and million  respectively  or in subsequent years through in the aggregate amount of million 
we have elected the modified prospective transition method which requires that compensation costs be recorded  as earned  for all unvested stock options and restricted stock awards outstanding at june  as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of months 
options or stock awards issued to non employees and consultants are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and recognized over the related vesting or service period 
fair value of share based payments is determined using the black scholes valuation model which employs weighted average assumptions for expected volatility of the company s stock  expected term until exercise of the options  the risk free interest rate  and dividends  if any 
expected volatility is based on historical enzon stock price information 
recently issued accounting standards the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  in september the new standard provides guidance on the use of fair value in such measurements 
it also prescribes expanded disclosures about fair value measurements contained in the financial statements 
we are in the process of evaluating the new standard which is not expected to have any effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations although financial statement disclosures will be revised to conform to the new guidance 
the pronouncement  including the new disclosures  is effective for us as of the first quarter of 
table of contents in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation establishes criteria for recognizing and measuring the financial statement tax effects of positions taken on a company s tax returns 
a two step process is prescribed whereby the threshold for recognition is a more likely than not test that the tax position will be sustained upon examination and the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we currently recognize a tax position if it is probable of being sustained 
the interpretation is effective for us beginning january  and will be applicable to all tax positions upon initial adoption 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may continue to be recognized upon adoption 
we are evaluating the potential effects the interpretation may have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations  but we do not expect there to be any material consequence 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and amongst other things  sfas no 
permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments beginning after september  we are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
 but believe it will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those described 

table of contents our holdings of available for sale securities are comprised of equity and debt securities  time deposits and auction rate securities 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest the majority of our investments in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum  and at december  all of our holdings were in instruments maturing in four years or less 
the table below presents the amortized cost  fair value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our available for sale securities as of december  in thousands 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate our convertible notes payable outstanding have fixed interest rates 
accordingly the fair values of the respective issuances will fluctuate as market rates of interest move up or down 
fair values are also affected by changes in the price of our common stock 
our convertible senior unsecured notes in the principal amount of million at december  are due june  and have a fair value of million at that date 
our convertible subordinated notes in principal amount of million at december  are due july  the fair value of the notes was approximately million at december
