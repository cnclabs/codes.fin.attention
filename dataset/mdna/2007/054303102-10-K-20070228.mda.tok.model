when used in this discussion  the terms avon  company  we or us mean  unless the context otherwise indicates  avon products  inc and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries 
overview we are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products 
our business is conducted worldwide  primarily in the direct selling channel 
we presently have sales operations in approximately countries and territories  including the united states  and distribute products in approximately more 
our reportable segments are based on geographic operations in six regions north america  latin america  western europe  middle east africa  central eastern europe  asia pacific and china 
we centrally manage global brand marketing and supply chain organizations 
product categories include beauty  which consists of cosmetics  fragrances  skin care and toiletries  beauty plus  which consists of fashion jewelry  watches  apparel and accessories  and beyond beauty  which consists of home products and gift and decorative products 
sales from health and wellness products and mark  a global cosmetics brand that focuses on the market for young women  are included among these categories based on product type 
sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through approximately million independent representatives  who are independent contractors and not employees of avon 
the success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting  motivating and retaining representatives 
we view the geographic diversity of our businesses as a strategic advantage 
in developed markets  such as the united states  we seek to achieve growth in line with that of the overall beauty market  while in developing and emerging markets we have higher growth targets 
we have continued to experience strong growth from most developing markets  such as brazil  russia and turkey  and significant contribution from another  colombia  in which we acquired the avon business of our licensee during the fourth quarter of we have also experienced signs of improvement in certain developed markets  such as the united states and united kingdom 
we are taking steps to address continued declines in certain other developed markets  mexico and japan  but challenges remain as these markets require longer term solutions 
during  we experienced growth in all segments  except asia pacific 
in  we launched a comprehensive multi year turnaround plan  described below  which seeks to take cost out of our business and reinvest those savings in initiatives that we expect to generate revenues as well as increase profitability over the long run 
as part of this turnaround plan  in we invested ahead of savings and incurred incremental costs  including costs to implement restructuring initiatives  increased spending on advertising and higher inventory obsolescence expense 
operating profit during was negatively impacted by these costs associated with our turnaround plan 
additionally  higher compensation related expenses and expenses associated with the january   adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r negatively impacted operating profit 
strategic initiatives in november  we launched a comprehensive  multi year turnaround plan to restore sustainable growth 
our four point turnaround plan includes committing to brand competitiveness by focusing research and development resources on product innovation and by increasing our advertising  winning with commercial edge by more effectively utilizing pricing and promotion  expanding our sales leadership program and improving the attractiveness of our representative earnings opportunity as needed  elevating organizational effectiveness by redesigning our structure to eliminate layers of management in order to take full advantage of our global scale and size  and transforming the cost structure so that our costs are aligned to our revenue growth and remain so 
the turnaround plan is starting to deliver results 
we attacked our cost structure  primarily through delayering  and we have reinvested ahead of savings from this and other cost savings initiatives 
our initial investments have focused significantly on advertising and our direct selling channel  where we have increased investments in during  we increased our investment in advertising by from in to in  to support product launches  and in support of avon china s direct selling launch 
in  we expect to increase our investment in advertising by to almost we are also committed to increasing our spending on product and brand innovation 
in  we launched several new innovative products  including anew clinical thermafirm face lifting cream  anew clinical eye lift  superfull mascara  avon solutions ageless results  ultra moisture rich metallic lipstick  avon crystal aura fragrance  avon blue rush fragrance and derek jeter driven fragrance 
in  we expect to implement a comprehensive strategy to reposition and rebrand our color line  including product innovation  upgrading packaging  a significant increase in advertising  improved merchandising and new brochure executions 
we are forging alliances for our color line including alliances with a color make up artist and an international fashion designer 
in  we also plan to launch a global integrated marketing campaign  called hello tomorrow  supporting both the brand and the direct selling channel 
additionally  we expect to continue to reallocate the time our research and development department spends toward innovation and away from promotional items 
we are also investing in our direct selling channel to improve the reward and effort equation for our representatives representative value proposition 
we have accelerated the roll out of our sales leadership program and have undertaken extensive analysis to better understand the drivers of value for our representatives 
in  we will continue to look for ways to improve the earnings opportunity for representatives through various means  including the following evaluating optimum commissions in select markets  continuing to roll out our sales leadership program  which offers representatives an enhanced career opportunity  strategically examining fee structure and brochure costs to enhance representative economics  and recalibrating the frequency of campaigns to maximize representative selling opportunities 
while the earnings and effort equation will be different within our global portfolio of businesses  we expect that web enablement will be a key element to reduce representative effort worldwide 
we will focus on improving internet based tools for our representatives 
we will also focus on enhanced training of representatives and field management 
as part of our focus on brand competitiveness during  we sought to reduce brand and margin dilution from the sale of heavily discounted excess products 
as a result  we incurred higher inventory obsolescence expense of during the first quarter of  as it made more sense to discontinue selling these products rather than sell them at deep discounts and adversely affect sales of more profitable products 
as the year progressed  we also launched our product line simplification program pls  which includes an analysis of our product line to develop a smaller range of better performing  more profitable products 
this program is designed to improve the shopping experience  our brand image and representative experiences by reducing the number of sku s overall  which is expected to have significant savings implications 
over time we expect this initiative will improve customer service  reduce complexity and confusion of our offering to customers and representatives  simplify our product line for effectiveness and efficiency  impact the new product development decision making process  improve life cycle management procedures  improve inventory management  and drive improved supply chain utilization 
we incurred of costs related to our pls program during  primarily incremental inventory obsolescence expense of depending on the results of additional pls analyses that will be performed to identify the optimal product assortment over the next three years and timing of any resulting decisions  we may incur future costs related to pls in the range of principally in the form of inventory obsolescence charges 
we expect to realize annualized benefits from pls in the range of  with benefits building progressively over the next three years 
additionally  we are embarking on a strategic sourcing initiative ssi to reduce direct and indirect costs of materials  goods and services 
under this initiative  we will shift our purchasing strategy toward a global supplier orientation from one that is more local and component oriented 
beyond lower costs  our goal for this initiative is to improve asset management  service for representatives and vendor relationships 
we expect to realize initial benefits from ssi beginning in the second half of  with annualized benefits from this initiative in the range of by the end of we do not expect to incur any significant costs associated with this initiative 
we have also begun the implementation of a sales and operating planning process that is intended to better align demand plans with our supply capabilities and provide us with earlier visibility to any potential supply issues 
we have begun to institutionalize a zero overhead growth methodology zog in which inflation is offset by improvements in productivity 
these improvements in productivity will come primarily from previously announced initiatives such as our restructuring program  pls and ssi 
restructuring initiatives in connection with our four point turnaround plan  in november we announced a multi year restructuring plan 
we expect to incur total restructuring charges and other costs to implement our restructuring initiatives in the range of before taxes 
we have incurred total costs to implement  net of adjustments  of in and in for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the plan  primarily for employee related costs  including severance  pension and other termination benefits and professional service fees related to these initiatives 
approximately of the restructuring charges incurred in  have and are expected to result in cash expenditures  with a majority of the remaining cash payments expected to be made during approximately of the restructuring charges incurred in resulted in future cash expenditures 
we expect to incur significant additional charges over the next few years 
we expect our restructuring initiatives to deliver in excess of of annualized savings when fully realized 
the actions implemented to date resulted in savings of approximately in  most of which were associated with the delayering program that we completed in we expect that the actions announced to date will result in savings in the range of in specific actions during  and january for this phase of our restructuring initiatives included organization realignment and downsizing in each region and global through a process called delayering  taking out layers to bring senior management closer to operations  the phased outsourcing of certain services  including certain key human resource and customer service processes  and the move of certain services from markets within europe to lower cost shared service centers  the realignment of our north america distribution operations  the exit of certain unprofitable operations  including the closure of the avon salon spa  the closure of our operations in indonesia  the exit of a product line in china and the exit of the becoming product line in the us  and the reorganization of certain functions  primarily sales related organizations 
see note  restructuring initiatives  on pages f through f of this annual report on form k 
outlook we expect that our investments in both the brand and the direct selling channel will drive sustainable growth and revenue growth should average mid single digits over the long term 
our operating margin during will be impacted by incremental investments in advertising and the representative value proposition  as well as continued costs of restructuring and pls 
while operating margin should expand in from s level of  it is expected to be close to s level of in as the savings and benefits from restructuring  pls and ssi begin to exceed the incremental levels of investment in advertising and the representative value proposition  operating margin is then expected to further expand beginning in new accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant 
the impact from the adoption of sfas r during  including restricted stock units granted in connection with design changes to share based compensation plans related to the adoption  decreased income before taxes and minority interest  net income  basic and diluted earnings per share  and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   by   
and respectively  while it increased net cash provided by financing activities by see note  description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  share based compensation plans and other long term incentive plan 
effective december   we adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas 
we adopted sfas as of december  the adoption of sfas resulted in a decrease to our shareholders equity by  on an after tax basis  a decrease to other assets of  an increase in accrued compensation of and a decrease in employee benefit plans liability of the adoption of sfas had no impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   or for any prior period presented  and it will not affect our operating results in future periods 
see note  employee benefit plans 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
fin prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement attribute  as well as criteria for subsequently recognizing  derecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions for financial statement purposes 
fin also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is effective january   for avon 
the impact of adopting fin is not expected to be material based on work performed to date  but we continue to assess the impact of fin along with implementation guidance as it is issued 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective january  for avon 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
key performance indicators within the following discussion and analysis  we utilize the key performance indicators kpis defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business 
kpi definition change in active representatives this indicator is based on the number of representatives submitting an order in a campaign  totaled for all campaigns in the related period 
this amount is divided by the number of billing days in the related period  to exclude the impact of year to year changes in billing days for example  holiday schedules 
to determine the change in active representatives  this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year 
change in units this indicator is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period  as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year 
units sold include samples sold and product contingent upon the purchase of another product for example  gift with purchase or purchase with purchase  but exclude free samples 
inventory days this indicator is equal to the number of days of estimated future months cost of sales covered by the inventory balance at the end of the period 
critical accounting estimates we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
see note  description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies  for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
restructuring reserves we record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
 employer s accounting for post employment benefits for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement 
one time benefit arrangements and disposal costs  primarily contract termination costs  are accounted for under the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we evaluate impairment issues under the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we estimate the expense for these initiatives  when approved by the appropriate corporate authority  by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans 
these expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits  impairment of property  plant and equipment  contract termination payments for leases  and any other qualifying exit costs 
these estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel 
such costs represent management s best estimate  but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time  including attrition rates 
estimates are evaluated periodically to determine if and adjustment is required 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable representatives contact their customers  selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign 
sales campaigns are generally for a two week duration in the us and a two to four week duration outside the us the representative purchases products directly from avon and may or may not sell them to an end user 
in general  the representative  an independent contractor  remits a payment to avon each sales campaign  which relates to the prior campaign cycle 
the representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid  however  there are circumstances where the representative fails to make the required payment 
we record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances 
over the past three years  annual bad debt expense has been approximately to  or approximately of total revenue 
we generally have no detailed information concerning  or any communication with  any end user of our products beyond the representative 
we have no legal recourse against the end user for the collectibility of any accounts receivable balances due from the representative to us 
if the financial condition of our representatives were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowances for sales returns we record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns 
over the past three years  sales returns have been in the range of to  or approximately of total revenue 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns  due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies  or for other reasons  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence  we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle  future marketing sales plans and the disposition process 
we assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision 
if actual sales are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence 
annual obsolescence expense was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as discussed in the overview section  includes inventory obsolescence charges of related to our pls program and related to our decision to discontinue the sale of heavily discounted excess products 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit expense we maintain defined benefit pension plans  which cover substantially all employees in the us and in certain international locations 
additionally  we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for certain current and retired executives see note  employee benefit plans 
our calculations of pension  postretirement and postemployment costs are dependent upon the use of assumptions  including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest cost  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  mortality rates  the number of associate retirements  the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments and other factors 
actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense in future periods 
at december   we had actuarial losses of and for the us and us plans  respectively  that have not yet been charged to expense 
these actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within equity in accordance with sfas  which was adopted december  while we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension  postretirement and postemployment obligations and future expense 
for  the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets  including the us and us plans was 
in determining the long term rates of return  we consider the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies  historical rates of return and current economic forecasts 
we evaluate the expected long term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary 
the majority of our pension plan assets relate to the us pension plan 
the assumed rate of return for for the us plan was  which was based on an asset allocation of approximately in corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term and in equity securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term 
historical rates of return on the assets of the us plan for the most recent year and year periods were and  respectively 
in the us plan  our asset allocation policy has favored us equity securities  which have returned and  respectively  over the year and year periods 
the actual rate of return on plan assets in the us was approximately and in and  respectively 
the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high quality rating from a recognized rating agency 
the discount rates for our more significant plans  including our us plan  were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan 
the weighted average discount rate for us and us plans determined on this basis was at december   and at december  future effects of pension plans on our operating results will depend on economic conditions  employee demographics  mortality rates  the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments  investment performance and funding decisions  among other factors 
however  given current assumptions including those noted above  pension expense related to the us plan is expected to increase in the range of to a basis point change in either direction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases  would have had the following effect on pension expense increase decrease in pension expense basis point increase basis point decrease rate of return on assets discount rate rate of compensation increase taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future  in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease earnings in the period such determination was made 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
we file income tax returns in many jurisdictions 
in  a number of income tax returns are scheduled to close by statute and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed 
if avon s filing positions are ultimately upheld  it is possible that the provision for income taxes may reflect adjustments 
depending on the number of filing positions ultimately upheld  the impact of the adjustments could be significant to net income 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options 
this model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
loss contingencies in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable 
our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation  which  by its nature is unpredictable 
we believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact the consolidated financial statements

other expenses interest expense increased in and  mainly due to higher borrowings to support our share repurchase programs  as well as increases in domestic interest rates 
at december  and  we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding long term  fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on libor 
our total exposure to floating interest rates at december  was approximately 
interest income increased in both and  primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances invested offshore at higher interest rates 
other expense  net increased in  primarily because included a net gain of million on the sale of investments in equity securities and a gain of on a treasury lock agreement that was no longer designated as a hedge

effective tax rate the effective tax rate for was  compared to for during  the tax rate was favorably impacted by approximately points due to the closure of tax years by expiration of the statute of limitations and audit settlements as well as points due to tax refunds 
these benefits were partially offset by the repatriation of international earnings  which increased the rate by approximately points  and the tax impact associated with our restructuring charges due to the lower weighted average effective tax rate of subsidiaries incurring the charges

north america compared to point change us local currency total revenue operating profit operating margin units sold active representatives total revenue increased in  as the larger average order received from representatives more than offset a decline in active representatives 
revenue in benefited from new product launches  supported by significant advertising 
the increase in average order was driven by strong sales of products in the beauty plus category  which has a higher price point 
the primary contributor to the decline in active representatives was a decrease in the number of orders placed 
while active representatives declined overall for  we noted an improvement in the second half of the year  turning to slight growth in the fourth quarter 
we believe this improvement was primarily driven by a variety of representative value enhancing initiatives we implemented during the second half of in our us business designed to increase representative ordering activity  combined with our increased consumer investments and some easing in the negative impact from higher fuel prices 
in the us  these representative value enhancing initiatives included re indexing of certain earnings thresholds in our sales leadership program  distributing bonus brochures to higher performing representatives and strengthening sales incentives 
we expect this improvement to continue as we implement our representative value proposition 
the decrease in operating margin in north america was primarily driven by incremental costs to implement restructuring initiatives  including costs associated with our decision to realign north america distribution operations  delayering and the closure of the avon salon spa 
these incremental costs negatively impacted operating margin by points 
the decrease in operating margin was also due to substantially higher spending on advertising  higher performance based compensation expenses  higher allocation of global expenses  and incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives  partially offset by expense reduction efforts 
north america compared to point change us local currency total revenue operating profit operating margin units sold active representatives total revenue declined in as compared to primarily due to a decline in beauty sales 
the decline in beauty sales was due to decreases in units sold and active representatives  reflecting lower customer purchase frequency and ongoing competitive intensity 
beauty plus sales increased and beyond beauty sales decreased  partially reflecting the shift in product mix in these two categories which occurred as part of our planned repositioning strategy 
beauty plus sales increased primarily due to the national roll out of an intimate apparel line  during  in the us during  the us business exited the toy category  which was part of beyond beauty and which contributed to decreased sales in this category 
north american operating margin declined primarily due to declines in the us  reflecting the unfavorable impacts of pricing and product mix  including the roll out of the intimate apparel line

the region benefited from the fourth quarter acquisition of our licensee in colombia  as that market contributed points to the region s revenue growth 
the region benefited from continued strength in brazil  where revenues increased due to larger average order and increased active representatives  reflecting new product launches supported by significant advertising and promotional activities 
the increase in revenue in brazil and the acquisition and growth of colombia more than compensated for continued declines in mexico  where revenues decreased  mainly due to a decline in active representatives 
the decline in active representatives reflected  in part  challenges related to field execution caused by a change in the attractiveness of incentives  including ineffective performance management for our zone managers 
in  we have commenced a number of initiatives to improve performance in mexico  including an upgrade of field talent and investments in incentives and motivation programs  and we may see improvement by the end of  as we continue to increase advertising and focus on field execution through the representative value proposition 
we also plan to continue to focus on our supply chain transition in mexico 
the decrease in operating margin in latin america during was most significantly impacted by increased spending on advertising  incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives  higher allocation of global expenses  and a gain on the sale of property in mexico  partially offset by operating efficiencies due to the revenue increase 
additionally  incremental costs to implement our restructuring initiatives negatively impacted operating margin by points 
currency restrictions enacted by the venezuelan government in have become more restrictive and have further impacted the ability of our subsidiary in venezuela avon venezuela to obtain foreign currency at the official rate to pay for imported products 
as a result of this increased difficulty  during  avon venezuela purchased approximately in the parallel market that resulted in a foreign exchange loss of unless official foreign exchange is made more readily available  avon venezuela s operations will continue to be negatively impacted as it will need to obtain more of its foreign currency needs from the parallel market

revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in russia due to strong active representative growth and increased advertising  partially offset by a decline in other countries  principally poland 
this decline was mainly due to underperformance in color cosmetics during the first three quarters of  primarily as a result of ineffective merchandising 
the declines were also due to increased competition in beauty 
color cosmetics sales grew during the fourth quarter  including in poland  following changes made to color merchandising and increased advertising 
operating margin was negatively impacted by higher spending for advertising  higher allocation of global expenses and incremental inventory obsolescence expense related to our inventory initiatives

asia pacific compared to point change us local currency total revenue operating profit operating margin units sold active representatives the region s revenue decline during was primarily attributable to decreases in units sold and active representatives  reflecting continued declines in these measures in japan  as well as the closing of our indonesian operations in early japan s revenue declined  driven by declines in the direct mail business  reflecting the ongoing rebalancing of our efforts between direct selling fundamentals and the number of direct mailings 
while revenue declined in japan during  the decline in the second half was to a lesser extent than in the first half  as the business responded to actions we took to improve representative economics  as well as a decision to restore some direct mailings 
while our business in japan has responded positively to our early actions  our long term objective continues to be to stabilize this business

china compared to point change us local currency total revenue operating profit operating margin units sold active representatives calculation not meaningful our business in china continues to evolve with the opening of direct selling 
in late february  avon received the first national license to commence direct selling under directives issued by the chinese government in late since then  we have been actively recruiting a direct selling force  called sales promoters  throughout the country 
these sales promoters must be trained and certified according to government regulations 
as of december   we had over  certified sales promoters  approximately  of whom fit our standard definition of active representatives 
we have been and continue to be engaged in comprehensive training of these sales promoters to help them build their business by developing their customer base and product knowledge 
in  we plan to initiate a removal program  consistent with removal programs in our other markets  to eliminate inactive certified sales promoters after a period of time 
since we received our license  other companies have received direct selling licenses  with two large multi national competitors receiving regional licenses in late prior to the reopening of direct selling we had sold our products in china through a network of licensed beauty boutiques  as well as dealer owned and company owned store counters 
the company owned store counters were exited as part of our restructuring initiatives 
in addition to being a retail boutique  a beauty boutique can now participate in direct selling by operating as a service center to the sales promoters  an essential element of the direct selling model stipulated in the direct selling regulations  for which they can earn service fees from avon 
china s revenue is now generated through sales promoters  beauty boutiques and dealer owned counters 
total revenue increased in  as significant growth in direct selling more than offset the lower revenue from beauty boutiques  as they reduced their order sizes in connection with the resumption of direct selling  as well as the unfavorable impact of the exit of company owned counters  which had a negative nine point impact on revenue growth 
total revenue in also benefited from the favorable effects of foreign exchange 
due to the significant growth of direct selling since our march launch  direct selling is becoming a greater portion of our business and is expected to continue as it is built up 
at the same time that we have been building on direct selling  we have stabilized our beauty boutiques 
during  we have not experienced a significant decline in the number of beauty boutiques  and we ended with a similar number of active beauty boutiques as compared to the beginning of the operating margin decrease was primarily driven by significantly higher spending on advertising  fees paid to registered service centers for providing services to our active representatives  and other costs associated with the launch of direct selling 
china compared to point change us local currency total revenue operating profit operating margin units sold active representatives calculation not meaningful revenue in china declined as the beauty boutique owners reduced the size of their orders as compared to the prior year in connection with the anticipated resumption of direct selling discussed above 
operating margin decreased driven by incremental costs to prepare for direct selling and the cost of maintaining our consumer investment  primarily through advertising  against a significantly lower revenue base 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations  commercial paper and borrowings under lines of credit 
we currently believe that existing cash  cash from operations including the impacts of cash required for restructuring initiatives and available sources of public and private financing are adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  dividends  capital expenditures  the stock repurchase program  possible acquisitions and other cash needs 
balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents total debt working capital cash flows net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased by during  primarily due to cash payments of approximately associated with restructuring charges  and additional cash payments associated with other costs to implement restructuring initiatives 
to a lesser extent  unfavorable working capital levels in inventory and accounts receivable contributed to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities 
these decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset by favorable working capital levels in accounts payable and lower payments associated with incentive compensation as compared to inventory levels have continued to increase during from at december  to at december   reflecting an increase in inventory coverage  partially driven by decisions to protect service levels in the first quarter of  higher sales volume and the impacts of foreign exchange 
as previously mentioned  our turnaround plan includes initiatives such as pls and sales and operations planning process that are expected to improve inventory levels 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans see note  employee benefit plans 
our funding policy for these plans is based on legal requirements and cash flows 
the amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in critical accounting estimates 
the future funding for these plans will depend on economic conditions  employee demographics  mortality rates  the number of associates electing to take lump sum distributions  investment performance and funding decisions 
based on current assumptions  we expect to contribute approximately and to our us and international pension plans  respectively  in net cash provided by operating activities in was favorable to principally reflecting higher net income adjusted for non cash items and lower income tax audit settlement payments in versus in offset by increased inventory levels 
additionally  operating cash flow was favorably impacted by the timing of accounts payable payments and unfavorably affected by higher contributions of approximately to the us and international pension plans in approximately in versus in and lower accruals for performance based compensation 
net cash used by investing activities net cash used by investing activities in was lower than in resulting from lower capital expenditures due to fewer major construction projects during  and the purchase of the avon direct selling business from our licensee in colombia for  partially offset by the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in our two joint venture subsidiaries in china for approximately capital expenditures during were compared with in the decrease in capital spending was primarily driven by spending in for our global research and development facility  capacity expansion and an enterprise resource planning erp system 
plant construction  expansion and modernization projects were in progress at december   with an estimated cost to complete of approximately capital expenditures in are currently expected to be in the range of to and will be funded by cash from operations 
these expenditures will include investments for capacity expansion  the construction of a new distribution facility in north america and information systems including the continued development of the erp system 
net cash used by investing activities in was higher than in resulting primarily from the purchase of the avon direct selling business from our licensee in colombia for  partially offset by the purchase of a portion of the ownership interest in our subsidiary in china for and lower capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during were compared with in the decrease in capital spending was primarily driven by investments in for a new manufacturing facility in russia and the construction of a global research and development facility  partially offset by spending in for an erp system 
net cash used by financing activities net cash used by financing activities in was higher than in  mainly driven by higher borrowings during and lower proceeds from stock option exercises during  partially offset by lower repurchases of common stock during net cash used by financing activities in was lower than in  mainly driven by higher commercial paper borrowings  partially offset by higher repurchases of common stock  lower proceeds from stock option exercises  and higher dividend payments 
we purchased approximately million shares of avon common stock for during  as compared to approximately million shares of avon common stock for during and approximately million shares of avon common stock for during  under our previously announced share repurchase programs and through acquisition of stock from employees in connection with tax payments upon vesting of restricted stock 
during  we increased sequentially the purchases under our program as we have been accelerating the pace of our repurchase program 
dividends of

debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments at december   our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments by due dates were as follows and beyond total short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations total debt debt related interest total debt related operating leases purchase obligations benefit obligations total debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments the amount of debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments excludes amounts due pursuant to derivative transactions 
the table also excludes information on recurring purchases of inventory as these purchase orders are non binding  are generally consistent from year to year  and are short term in nature 
amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans  as well as expected contributions for to our funded pension benefit plans 
see note  debt and other financing  and note  leases and commitments  for further information on our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments 
additionally  as disclosed in note  restructuring initiatives  we have a remaining liability of associated with the restructuring charges recorded to date  and we also expect to record additional restructuring expenses of in future periods to implement the actions for which charges were recorded during the significant majority of these liabilities will require cash payments during off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
capital resources total debt at december  increased to  from  at december   primarily due to the principal amount of notes payable issued in january see note  debt and other financing  partially offset by lower commercial paper borrowings 
we have a five year   revolving credit and competitive advance facility the credit facility  which expires in january the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes 
the interest rate on borrowings under the new credit facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime or plus the federal funds rate 
the credit facility has an annual fee of  payable quarterly  based on our current credit ratings 
the credit facility contains various covenants  including a financial covenant which requires avon s interest coverage ratio determined in relation to our consolidated pretax income and interest expense to equal or exceed the credit facility also provides for a possible extension of the term by up to two years and possible increases by up to an aggregate incremental principal amount of  subject to the consent of the affected lenders under the credit facility 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
we have a  commercial paper program 
under this program  we may issue from time to time unsecured promissory notes in the commercial paper market in private placements exempt from registration under federal and state securities laws  for a cumulative face amount not to exceed  outstanding at any one time and with maturities not exceeding days from the date of issue 
the commercial paper short term notes issued under the program are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to voluntary prepayment 
the commercial paper program is supported by our credit facility 
outstanding commercial paper effectively reduces the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility 
at december   we had commercial paper outstanding of in august  we entered into a one year japanese yen billion at the exchange rate on december  uncommitted credit facility yen credit facility with the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj  ltd 
borrowings under the yen credit facility bear interest at the yen libor rate plus an applicable margin 
the yen credit facility is available for general corporate purposes  including working capital and the repayment of outstanding indebtedness 
the yen credit facility was used to repay the japanese yen billion note which came due in september  as well as for other general corporate purposes 
the yen credit facility is designated as a hedge of our net investment in our japanese subsidiary 
at december   japanese yen billion was outstanding under the yen credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants in our indentures see note  debt and other financing 
such indentures do not contain any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to reduce the potential negative effects from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates arising from our business activities 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments and through operational means 
since we use foreign currency rate sensitive and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of our existing and forecasted transactions  we expect that any loss in value for the hedge instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives 
the master agreements governing our derivative contracts generally contain standard provisions that could trigger early termination of the contracts in certain circumstances  including if we were to merge with another entity and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity were to be materially weaker than that of avon prior to the merger 
interest rate risk our long term  fixed rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
we use interest rate swaps  which effectively convert the fixed rate on the debt to a floating interest rate  to manage our interest rate exposure 
at december  and  we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding long term  fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on libor 
avon s total exposure to floating interest rates at december  and december  was approximately and  respectively 
our long term borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at december   a hypothetical basis point change either an increase or a decrease in interest rates prevailing at that date  sustained for one year  would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change was calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates comparable to our current cost of debt 
foreign currency risk we operate globally  with operations in various locations around the world 
over the past three years  approximately to of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the us the functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency 
we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of our operations  primarily due to international businesses and transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the use of various financial instruments to fund ongoing activities 
at december   the primary currencies for which we had net underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposures were the argentine peso  brazilian real  british pound  canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  colombian peso  the euro  japanese yen  mexican peso  polish zloty  russian ruble  turkish lira and venezuelan bolivar 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our hedges of our foreign currency exposure are not designed to  and  therefore  cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our foreign currency financial instruments were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes 
based on our foreign exchange contracts at december   the impact of a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against our foreign exchange contracts would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 
the hypothetical impact was calculated on the open positions using forward rates at december   adjusted for an assumed appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against these hedging contracts 
credit risk of financial instruments we attempt to minimize our credit exposure to counterparties by entering into derivative transactions and similar agreements only with major international financial institutions with a or higher credit ratings as issued by standard poor s corporation 
our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts  swaps or options with major international financial institutions 
although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments  we believe that the risk of incurring credit risk losses is remote and that such losses  if any  would not be material 
non performance of the counterparties on the balance of all the foreign exchange and interest rate agreements would result in a net write off of at december  in addition  in the event of non performance by such counterparties  we would be exposed to market risk on the underlying items being hedged as a result of changes in foreign exchange and interest rates
