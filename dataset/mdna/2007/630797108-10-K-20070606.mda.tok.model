table of contents until december   napster was known as roxio  inc  and we operated our business in two divisions  the consumer software division csd and the online music distribution division  also known as the napster division 
on december   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of csd to sonic solutions  a california corporation sonic  including all of the capital stock of certain international subsidiaries 
since the sale of csd  we have focused exclusively on our online music distribution business under the napster brand and  since january   have been traded on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol naps 
napster was incorporated in delaware in august napster is headquartered in los angeles 
we derive our primary revenues from online subscriptions and permanent music downloads 
the paid napster service offers subscribers on demand access to a wide variety of music that can be streamed or downloaded as well as the ability to purchase individual tracks or albums on an a la carte basis 
subscription and permanent download fees are paid by end user customers in advance either via credit card  online payment systems or redemption of pre paid cards  gift certificates or promotional codes 
napster also periodically licenses merchandising rights and resells hardware that our end users may utilize to store and replay their digital music content 
since the acquisition of pressplay on may   our digital music distribution business has operated at a loss and negative cash flow 
we expect to continue to operate at a loss and net negative cash flow due to our significant investments to enhance service capabilities  market our products and grow worldwide 
the market for digital music is rapidly growing and we expect our digital music distribution business to continue to grow as the industry expands 
this market is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to increase in the future as the market expands 
we believe that our unique technology and feature set positions us ahead of many of our competitors 
our overall strategy is to continue to pursue and execute strategic partnerships  continue to innovate by investing in new services and technologies  and continue to reduce our subscriber customer acquisition cost and churn 
significant transactions strategic partnership with aol on january   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with aol music now  llc and aol  llc  collectively referred to as aol and an advertising agreement with aol  llc  collectively the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  all of the subscribers to the aol music now service  together with certain related assets and liabilities  were transferred to napster on march  additionally  we were granted certain exclusive advertising rights throughout the aol music channel for one year  subject to renewal upon the achievement of certain milestones  and aol guaranteed to deliver a minimum amount of advertising impressions to the company 
under the terms of the agreement  we will pay a total of approximately million to aol 
we paid million in cash to aol in january investment in unconsolidated entity on october   we entered into a joint venture operating agreement with tower records japan  inc tower japan  relating to the formation and operation of a japan based joint venture company the joint venture for the purpose of operating the napster music service in japan 
during  we contributed million japanese yen million as of the dates of the contributions in exchange for a ownership interest and tower japan contributed a total of million japanese yen for a ownership interest 
tower japan is obligated to arrange or provide debt or equity funding  including through an unsecured revolving line of credit 
napster has no obligation to fund future losses or make additional contributions other than the investment described above 
napster and tower japan have customary shareholder rights in the joint venture  including veto rights  rights to appoint directors and officers and rights of first refusal 

table of contents under the terms of this agreement  we licensed intellectual property rights to the joint venture  including platform technology and trademarks  in exchange for certain guaranteed royalties 
tower japan is also obligated to support the joint venture s marketing and advertising activities 
the joint venture has exclusive rights to operate the napster service in japan  and launched its service during october issuance of common stock on january   we issued  shares of common stock in a private placement to certain accredited investors 
the shares were sold at a price of per share with gross proceeds of million 
the gross proceeds were reduced by placement fees and legal fees totaling approximately million 
sale of consumer software division on december   we sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of csd  including all of the capital stock of certain international subsidiaries historically included in csd  to sonic 
the remaining international subsidiaries historically included in csd were substantially liquidated as of december  sonic paid us a total of million in cash and  shares of sonic common stock  valued at approximately million as of the closing date 
the transaction was structured as an asset sale 
the disposition is accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
therefore  the results of operations of csd have been reclassified to results of operations from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies 
certain of these policies require substantial judgment on the part of management 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including those related to revenue recognition  music publishing rights and music royalty accruals  capitalized software development costs  income taxes  contingencies  and equity instruments actual results could differ from these estimates 
these critical accounting policies and the effect that changes in management s estimates could have on our consolidated financial statements are further described below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements  eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  and eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
in general  we recognize revenue  net of sales related taxes  when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  the product or services have been delivered and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents music subscriptions are paid in advance  typically for monthly or annual periods 
music subscription revenues are recognized ratably on a daily basis over the subscription period 
revenues from sales of individual songs or albums by download are recognized at the time the music is delivered  digitally  to the end user 
revenues from pre paid cards and promotions are deferred and then generally recognized as i tracks are downloaded by the end users  or ii if redeemed for a subscription  over the subscription period 
in cases where prepaid promotions are not expected to be redeemed  revenue is recognized when we have no further obligation to provide services or refund the associated prepayments breakage 
effective in october  revenue from prepaid cards is recognized ratably over the usage period  including estimated breakage based on historical experience 
prior to october we did not have sufficient historical experience to estimate prepaid card breakage rates  and recognized prepaid card breakage only when our obligation to honor the redemption of the prepaid card had legally expired 
revenues from licensing of napster trademarks are recognized upon receipt of royalty reports from the licensee or  for prepaid royalties  when we provide or have no further obligation to provide services 
we have arrangements whereby customers pay one price for multiple products and services 
in some cases  these arrangements involve a combination of hardware and services 
in other cases  the customer pays a single price for multiple music downloads and months of music subscriptions 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate units in accordance with eitf consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values 
in the event that there is no objective and reliable evidence of fair value  the revenue recognized upon delivery is the total arrangement consideration less the fair value of the undelivered items 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
we have arrangements with certain customers whereby the customer provides goods or services to us 
our revenue and the charges for the goods or services provided by a customer are accounted for in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  including subsequent interpretations 
the costs of separately identifiable goods or services received by us from a customer are valued at the cost we would incur to procure the same goods or services from a non customer third party 
if the goods or services cannot be separated  the total consideration is recorded as a reduction of revenues 
consideration paid to customers under these arrangements that exceeds the separately identifiable value of the goods or services provided would be reflected as a reduction of the customer s revenue 
we recognize revenue gross or net in accordance with eitf in most arrangements  we contract directly with the end user customers  are the primary obligor and carry all collectibility risk 
revenue in these arrangements is recorded on a gross basis 
in some cases  we utilize third party distributors to sell products or services directly to end user customers  and we carry no collectibility risk 
in some cases  we pay operating expenses for the distributor and are reimbursed at cost plus a small mark up 
in both of those instances  we report the revenue net of the amount paid to the distributor 
management exercises significant judgment in determining the fair value of multiple elements within revenue arrangements or separately identified goods or services  in assessing when prepaid promotions or royalties no longer involve a future obligation and in estimating future breakage rates 
these estimates represent our best estimates  but changes in circumstances relating to the products and services sold in these arrangements may result in one time expense or revenue charges 

table of contents music publishing rights and music royalty accruals under copyright law we are required to pay licensing fees for compositions embodied in digital sound recordings and for the sound recordings themselves that we deliver in our napster service 
copyright law generally does not specify the rate and terms of the licenses  which are determined by voluntary negotiations among the parties or  for certain compulsory publishing licenses where voluntary negotiations are unsuccessful  by arbitration 
there are certain geographies and agencies for which we have not yet completed negotiations with regard to the royalty rate to be applied to the current or historic sales of our digital music offerings 
we accrue for the cost of these fees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 based on contracted or statutory rates  when established  or management s best estimates based on facts and circumstances regarding the specific music services and agreements in similar geographies or with similar agencies 
while napster bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and  as a result  could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
capitalized software development costs internal use software 
software development costs incurred as part of an approved project plan that result in additional functionality to internal use software are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software  generally three years 
software held for sale 
development costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers 
we have not capitalized any such software development costs as technological feasibility is generally not established until a working model is completed  at which time substantially all development is complete 
management applies significant judgment when determining whether products under development are technologically feasible or whether it is probable that they will result in additional functionality 
these judgments include assessments of our development progress and expected performance 
additionally  the future realizability of capitalized software costs is subject to regular review by management  who consider expected future benefits 
the estimates of expected future benefits include judgments about growth in demand for our products  performance by our strategic partners and fair values for related services 
changes in these estimates could require us to write down the carrying value of these capitalized amounts and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves determining our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from various means  including future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
the above process is computed separately for each of continuing operations  the discontinued operation and elements of other comprehensive income 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of march   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  net of reversing deferred tax liabilities  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses and accrued liabilities and other provisions not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the timing of the reversal of the remaining deferred tax liability related to the election to step up the tax basis of the pressplay goodwill is indefinite 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
contingencies we account for contingent liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 pursuant to which contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
management applies significant judgment when estimating probable amounts of contingent liabilities 
future negotiations regarding the contingent obligations could cause the ultimate obligation to be less than or greater than the amount estimated 
changes in these estimates could require us to take additional charges or benefits in future periods and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
equity instruments effective april   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards issued to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
under sfas no 
r  compensation expense for all share based compensation awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the period the employee performs the related services  generally the vesting period  net of estimated forfeitures 
napster estimates forfeitures based on historical experience and revises the rates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from previous estimates 
management applies significant judgment when determining estimated forfeiture rates 
while napster bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and  as a result  could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

table of contents service revenues service revenues increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to growth in our subscriber base  international expansion and new revenue streams  offset by a decrease in revenue from music downloads 
paid subscribers grew from  at march  to  at march  and  at march  during fiscal we had a full year revenue benefit from the fiscal paid subscriber growth 
additionally  the napster music service was launched in germany during december and in japan during october this increase in our subscriber base and international expansion drove an million increase in subscription service revenues 
we also began marketing new revenue streams such as advertising during may and our napster mobile music service during august new revenue streams contributed million of net revenue during fiscal the service revenues in fiscal also include a approximately million of non recurring revenues related to prepaid cards that were sold previously and that we estimate will never be redeemed and for which we have no further obligation prepaid card breakage and b a decrease of approximately million in download revenue  because our growing base of subscription customers do not need to purchase individual song tracks 
for the purpose of paid subscriber calculations  we include university subscribers  japanese subscribers  napster mobile subscribers and the over  aol music now subscribers as of their march  transition date 
we anticipate that service revenues will continue to increase in the future as we get the full year revenue benefit in fiscal from the fiscal paid subscriber growth 
near term  service revenues will be impacted by normal summer seasonality 
product and license revenues product and license revenues for fiscal decreased million as compared to fiscal primarily due to the timing of hardware promotional programs 
fiscal included a single hardware promotion that resulted in million of revenue  which was not continued in we expect that product and license revenues will continue to be a small portion of net revenues and fluctuate depending on our product promotions and licenses 
geographic revenues the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the summary of our revenues from continuing operations by geography year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended march  in thousands revenues north america europe net revenues the revenue increase in north america for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to a million increase in subscriber revenue  the million in prepaid card breakage  the million of revenue from new revenue streams  offset by the million decrease in product revenue and a million decrease in download revenue 
the increase in service revenue is primarily due to the paid subscriber increase in the past two years 

table of contents the increase in revenue in europe for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily related to the launch of music service in germany in december we anticipate that the proportion of revenue outside of the united states will fluctuate as a result of continued marketing activities and initiatives focused on world wide customer growth and international expansion 
gross margin the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our gross margin from continuing operations year ended march  as a percentage of related revenues for the year ended march  in thousands gross margin service product and license total gross margin service gross margin is the profit from revenues after deducting the cost of royalties to content providers and publishers  technical support  bandwidth and hosting costs  depreciation and amortization of infrastructure and certain identifiable intangible assets related to the delivery of the services  and any other direct costs of providing the services 
product and license gross margin is the profit from revenues after deducting the cost of product sold  order fulfillment services  product shipping costs and any other direct expenses to deliver the product or licenses 
service gross margin as a percentage of related revenue improved in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the non recurring prepaid card breakage revenues  which had no associated direct costs 
excluding non recurring revenues  service gross margin for fiscal decreased one percentage point from fiscal this change is primarily due to increased license fees and additional ongoing expenditures for service infrastructure  offset in part by a change in revenue mix from download revenues to subscription revenues  which have a higher gross margin 
product and license gross margin dollars decreased for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the terms of hardware promotions 
service headcount dedicated to maintaining content and providing customer care was and at march  and  respectively 
near term  gross margins will decline because the million of prepaid card breakage revenues will not recur in fiscal excluding non recurring items and low margin hardware promotions  we expect gross margins to remain steady 
operating expenses we classify operating expenses as research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
each category includes related expenses for salaries  employee benefits  incentive compensation  stock based compensation  travel  telephone  communications  facility costs and professional fees 
our sales and marketing expenses include additional expenditures specific to the marketing group  such as public relations  advertising  trade shows  marketing collateral materials and subscriber acquisition costs  as well as expenditures specific to the sales group  such as commissions and referral fees paid to marketing partners 
in addition  we include amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets as operating expenses 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our operating expenses from continuing operations year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended march  in thousands research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits including stock based compensation and contractors fees for our development and other costs associated with the minor enhancements of existing products  development of new services or development of new features for existing services 
research and development expenses decreased for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to net lower headcount costs and lower depreciation 
headcount and contractor costs decreased in fiscal following the release of new products in mid fiscal  and because we dedicated a portion of our research and development efforts in on reimbursable projects for napster japan 
the reduction in headcount costs was offset by the increase in stock based compensation expense 
depreciation decreased because capital assets were fully depreciated in mid fiscal research and development headcount was at march  and at march  fiscal research and development expenditures are expected to remain flat in  and will focus on improved mobile delivery and other product enhancements 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits including stock based compensation for sales and marketing personnel  referral fees paid to marketing partners  other subscriber acquisition costs  as well as costs associated with advertising and promotions 
sales and marketing expenses decreased for fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to the reduction in marketing programs 
we have substantially reduced our spend and our subscriber acquisition cost sac over the last year as we have moved away from offline advertising to targeted online spend where we can achieve very low cost per trialer as per our internal targets 
we have also increased our focus on our strategic distribution partners where we have moved from our original model of giving advances and guaranteed market development funds to a more variable cost model where we pay bounties only when we acquire subscribers 
sales and marketing headcount was at march  and at march  we expect sales and marketing expenses to remain steady near term as we trade fixed marketing program costs for variable fees that we expect we will pay as we add new subscribers through our strategic partnerships 
with this partner based variable cost model we expect to continue to keep our sac at the low levels we have recently achieved and keep the overall marketing spend at the reduced run rate 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits including stock based compensation for executive and administrative personnel  professional services  administrative outsources and other general corporate activities 
general and administrative expenses increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to approximately million higher professional and administrative outsource fees and million of stock based compensation  offset by an approximately  decrease in personnel related expense 
general and administrative headcount  including all corporate general and administrative employees  was at march  and march  general and administrative expenses may increase in the near term as certain administrative outsource fees increase when revenues increase  and we continue to incur costs to evaluate and defend against recent legal and other claims 
excluding those items  we plan to control general and administrative expense growth 
amortization of intangible assets beginning march  we had amortization expense related to the customer intangible acquired through the asset purchase agreement with aol 
amortization of intangible assets for fiscal consisted of amortization expense related to the intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of napster s name in december and napster  llc  formerly known as pressplay  in may those intangible assets were fully amortized as of march  future amortization expense will reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the aol customer intangible asset are consumed 
loss from unconsolidated entity the loss from unconsolidated entity represents our portion of the loss incurred by napster japan during the periods presented  limited to the extent of our cumulative equity contributions 
we do not expect to record further losses from napster japan unless we contribute additional capital in the future 
napster  llc has no obligation to fund future losses or provide additional capital contributions to napster japan 
in the event that napster japan issues additional equity ownership in the future and we do not participate in the financing  our ownership interest in napster japan would be diluted 
other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of interest income on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  realized gains losses due to foreign currency fluctuations  interest expense  change in the fair value of the hedge and other miscellaneous income 
other income  net  increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to million higher investment income due to higher interest rates  approximately  lower hedge discount expense in fiscal following the sale of our shares of sonic common stock in fiscal  an approximately  increase in foreign currency gains and a  decrease in interest expense following pay down and termination of our line of credit  offset by the million gain on the sale of the sonic common stock in fiscal  which did not recur in fiscal we expect other income  net  to decrease in the future as investments are used to fund operations 
we also expect other income  net  to fluctuate due to foreign currency fluctuations 

table of contents income tax benefit we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event that deferred tax assets would be realizable in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
during january  following the divestiture of csd  which utilized substantially all of our tax operating losses  napster made a tax election to step up the basis in the pressplay goodwill for tax purposes 
as a result  the pressplay goodwill is deductible for tax purposes  which creates a tax timing difference that is presented as a deferred tax liability and deferred tax expense 
as realization of this taxable temporary difference is not assured  a net tax expense related to this item is recorded 
the tax provisions for fiscal and represent primarily state franchise taxes  foreign taxes and the timing difference related to the pressplay goodwill 
the tax benefit in continuing operations in fiscal included a million tax benefit corresponding to the tax provision for the discontinued operations million gain on divestiture 
in the near term  we expect to continue to incur minimal income taxes as we are anticipating operating losses from operations 
we are subject to various tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
our tax provision does not take into account any future benefit from loss carryforwards  which may be realized if we again achieve profitability and begin generating taxable income 
income from discontinued operations napster had no ongoing activity in the discontinued operations during fiscal and the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal is comprised of an additional charge related to adjustments to stock based compensation on options issued primarily from fiscal to offset by the net tax benefit from the favorable resolution of previously provided tax contingencies related to csd 
during march  napster and sonic settled all adjustments described in the divestiture agreement and napster recognized an additional million gain on the divestiture  net of taxes

product and license gross margin is the profit from revenues after deducting the cost of product sold  order fulfillment services  product shipping costs and any other direct expenses to deliver the product or licenses 
the improvement in service gross margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the change in revenue mix from download revenues to subscription revenues  which have a higher margin  offset by additional ongoing expenditures for infrastructure to support our digital music distribution services 
product and license gross margins fluctuate based on the nature of the hardware promotions and the volume of trademark licenses in each period 
we also offer several product bundles  the revenues from which are allocated between service revenues and product and license revenues on a pro rata basis in accordance with eitf product and license gross margin decreased in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to more negative margin hardware promotions in fiscal as compared to fiscal online service headcount dedicated to maintaining content and providing customer care was at march  and at march

table of contents during january  following the divestiture of csd  which utilized substantially all of our tax operating losses  napster made a tax election to step up the basis in pressplay goodwill for tax purposes 
as a result  the pressplay goodwill is deductible for tax purposes  which creates a tax timing difference that is presented as a deferred tax liability and deferred tax expense 
as realization of this taxable temporary difference is not assured  a net tax expense related to this item is recorded 
income tax benefit decreased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the significant decrease in the tax benefit was due to the fiscal utilization of losses from continuing operations to offset income from the discontinued operations 
the fiscal expense represents primarily foreign taxes and the timing difference related to the pressplay goodwill 
income from discontinued operations the income from discontinued operations in fiscal primarily reflects the after tax impact of the purchase price settlement with sonic for the sale of csd in december the income from discontinued operations in fiscal primarily included the million after tax gain on the divestiture 
liquidity and capital resources we ended fiscal with million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
these amounts consist principally of commercial paper  corporate bonds  asset backed securities  money market funds and us government securities 
this balance represents a million decrease as compared to march  our primary ongoing source of cash is receipts from revenues 
the primary uses of cash are payroll salaries and related benefits  general operating expenses marketing  travel and office rent  payments to content providers  payments for products held for resale  and purchases of property and equipment  including software development costs 
in addition  we paid million in the th quarter of fiscal pursuant to the aol agreement 
our working capital was million at march  line of credit during part of fiscal we had a revolving line of credit  collateralized by substantially all of our assets  with silicon valley bank 
we had no borrowings under the line during fiscal  and terminated the line in october we were in compliance with all covenants under the line of credit at all times 
financial position we believe that the liquidity provided by existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next months 
napster operates and will continue to operate in the near term at a loss and with net negative cash flow  due to investments required to continuingly expand our subscriber base 

table of contents cash flow changes the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the components of cash flow activities in thousands for the year ended march  net loss gain on sale of businesses non cash expenses changes in operating assets and liabilities deferred revenue other working capital changes net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash used by operating activities is driven by our net loss  adjusted for non cash items  and change in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash adjustments include non cash gain  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  deferred income taxes and loss in unconsolidated entities 
cash provided by used in investing activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures  purchases and sales of short term investments  investment in return on investment from unconsolidated entity and proceeds from divestitures 
cash provided by used in financing activities is driven by our financing activities relating to employee stock plans  principal payments of long term debts and equity financing 
fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal is primarily due to a lower net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal additionally  the decrease in deferred revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the non recurring prepaid card breakage recognized during fiscal changes in other working capital items are primarily related to timing of receipts and payments 
the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the fact that we liquidated approximately million of investments to fund operating cash flows during fiscal and had invested approximately million of proceeds from the divestiture of csd in fiscal other than investment liquidation or new investments  the fiscal change in investing cash flows included a million cash receipt from sonic related to the divestiture of csd  offset by an million payment to aol pursuant to the aol agreement 
fiscal investing cash flows also included our million usd equivalent investment in our japan joint venture and million more capital expenditures than in fiscal the only financing activities in fiscal were related to employee stock plans and principal payments on capital lease obligations 
in fiscal we repaid the million outstanding balance under our million line of credit 

table of contents fiscal as compared to fiscal operating cash flows in fiscal were negatively impacted by an increase in net loss  and by the million non cash gains on the sale of csd and the sale of sonic common stock 
such items were partially offset by million in non cash expenses and million of changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the decrease of million in cash flows from deferred revenue in fiscal from million in fiscal is primarily due to the relative reduction in the subscriber growth from that experienced in fiscal  which was impacted by a full year s growth following the launch of the online music service in october changes in other working capital items are primarily related to timing of payments and receipts 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal is primarily because we invested proceeds from the sale of businesses during fiscal as of march  we had received over million from the sale of businesses  but much of the balance had not yet been invested 
fiscal was a use of cash for financing activities because we repaid our million line of credit  whereas fiscal was a source of cash from financing activities because we raised over million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock through a private equity financing and to employees 
contractual obligations at march   we had fixed non cancellable contractual obligations including capital leases  operating leases and other non cancelable contractual obligations as follows in thousands year ending march  non cancelable capital leases non cancelable operating leases other non cancelable contractual obligations total total we also have fixed rate commitments to pay fees and royalties on music delivered to our customers  as well as various arrangements with product vendors and other marketing partners to pay fees when new customers from their sites subscribe to our services 
at march  we had no indebtedness for borrowed money 
we expect that as our existing capital leases and operating leases terminate over the next few years  we will enter into new agreements which will result in new obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions and  as part of our cash management process  we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions 
amounts deposited with these institutions may exceed federal depository insurance limits 
in addition  the portfolio of investments conforms to our policy regarding concentration of investments  maximum maturity and quality of investment 
some of the securities in which we have invested may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to reduce this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  corporate bonds  us agencies securities  asset backed securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
all of our short term investments mature in less than one year 
the following table presents the amounts of our short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of march  our cash equivalents are invested in money market funds  commercial paper and corporate securities  which are not included in the table because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities in thousands  except interest rates 
less than one year more than one year total estimated fair value short term investments weighted average interest rate we do not currently hold any variable interest rate debt 
accordingly  we have not been exposed to near term adverse changes in interest rates or other market prices 
we may  however  experience such adverse changes if we incur debt or hold other derivative financial instruments in the future 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
exchange rate risk we market our napster service in north america  japan and parts of europe  resulting in transactions denominated in us dollars  canadian dollars  united kingdom pounds  euro and japanese yen 
as such  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity are remeasured to the functional currency of the legal entity at the period end exchange rates 
any associated currency re measurement gains and losses are recognized in current operations 

table of contents for our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency  we translate assets and liabilities to us dollars using period end exchange rates and translate revenues and expenses using average exchange rates during the period 
exchange gains and losses arising from translation of foreign entity financial statements are included as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
cash and cash equivalents are predominantly denominated in us dollars 
as of march  we held the equivalent of million us dollar of cash and cash equivalents in united kingdom pounds  million in euro and  in other foreign currencies
