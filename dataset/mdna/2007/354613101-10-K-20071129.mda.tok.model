overview we derive the majority of our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management  fund administration  shareholder services  transfer agency  underwriting  distribution  custodial  trustee and other fiduciary services collectively investment management and related services to retail mutual funds  and to institutional  high net worth  and separately managed accounts and other investment products 
this is our primary business activity and operating segment 
the mutual funds and other products that we offer collectively sponsored investment products are distributed or marketed to the public globally under six distinct names franklin templeton mutual series bissett fiduciary trust darby we offer a broad range of sponsored investment products under equity  hybrid  fixed income and money market categories that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individual and institutional investors 
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management 
to a lesser degree  our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts 
the fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients 
these arrangements could change in the future 
our secondary business and operating segment is banking finance 
our banking finance group offers selected private banking services to high net worth clients  and retail banking  consumer lending and trust services 
our consumer lending activities include automobile lending related to the purchase  securitization  and servicing of retail installment sales contracts originated by independent automobile dealerships  consumer credit and debit cards  real estate equity lines  home equity mortgage lending and other consumer lending 

table of contents in the fiscal year ended september  fiscal year  our investment management and related services operating segment continued to experience record levels of assets under management 
in addition to market appreciation  which reflected  among other things  the positive performance of many equity markets globally  this growth resulted from excess sales over redemptions 
in part  we attribute the continued positive trend in excess sales over redemptions to the strong relative performance of our product offerings  the successful marketing to and diversification of our client base  and our focus on customer service 
consistent with the increase in our assets under management  we experienced growth in net income and higher diluted earnings per share in fiscal year  as compared to the fiscal years ended september  fiscal year and september  fiscal year 
we expect to continue focusing on our core strategies of expanding our assets under management and related operations internationally  seeking positive investment performance  protecting and furthering our brand recognition  developing and maintaining broker dealer and client loyalties  providing a high level of customer service and closely monitoring costs  while also developing our human capital base and our systems and technology 
the continued success of these strategies in the future is dependent on various factors  including the relative performance of our sponsored investment products  product innovations by our competitors  and changes in consumer preferences

net income earnings per common share basic diluted operating margin defined as operating income divided by total operating revenues 
net income increased in fiscal year this was primarily due to increased fees for providing investment management and fund administration services investment management fees reflecting a increase in our simple monthly average assets under management  and a increase in other income  net primarily due to an increase in realized gains on sale of investments and higher gains from our consolidated sponsored investment products 
these increases were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses 
diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal year consistent with the increase in net income and a decrease in diluted weighted average common stock outstanding 
diluted weighted average common stock outstanding was higher in fiscal year than in fiscal year primarily due to the repurchases of shares of our common stock and the conversion of liquid yield notes zero coupon convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock during fiscal year net income and diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year these increases were primarily due to increased investment management fees and underwriting and distribution fees  each consistent with a increase in our simple monthly average assets under management and higher gross sales on which commissions are earned 
these increases were partially offset

our effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management was for fiscal years and the effective investment management fee rate remained unchanged primarily due to the favorable change in the mix of assets under management  resulting from higher excess sales over redemptions and greater appreciation of equity and hybrid products as compared to fixed income products  which was offset by a decrease in performance fees resulting from the divestiture of assets under management of a former subsidiary at october  generally  investment management fees earned on equity and hybrid products are higher than fees earned on fixed income products

annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided 

table of contents investment management fees increased in fiscal year consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a relatively unchanged effective investment management fee rate 
investment management fees increased in fiscal year consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management and an increase in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in simple monthly average mix of assets under management from fixed income products towards equity products  which generally carry higher investment management fees than fixed income products  and an increase in performance fees 
underwriting and distribution fees we earn underwriting fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase 
sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor 
therefore  underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales  the size of individual transactions  and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors 
globally  our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay distribution fees in return for sales  marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf 
specifically  the majority of us registered mutual funds  with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds  have adopted distribution plans the plans under rule b promulgated under the investment company act of  as amended rule b 
the plans permit the mutual funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares  such as expenses for marketing  advertising  printing and sales promotion  subject to the plans limitations on amounts 
the individual plans set a percentage limit for rule b expenses based on average daily net assets under management of the mutual fund 
similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non us funds and where  generally  the distributor of the funds in the local market arranges for and pays commissions 
we pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf 
see the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below 
overall  underwriting and distribution fees increased in fiscal year underwriting fees increased primarily due to a increase in gross product sales  including product sales that do not generate underwriting and distribution revenues 
distribution fees increased consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management and an increase in equity products as compared to fixed income products in the simple monthly average mix of assets under management 
distribution fees are generally higher for equity products  as compared to fixed income products 
underwriting and distribution fees increased in fiscal year underwriting fees increased consistent with a increase in gross product sales 
distribution fees increased consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a change in the asset and share class mix 
shareholder servicing fees shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered 
in some instances  sponsored investment products are charged these fees based on the level of assets under management 
we receive fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services  which include providing customer statements  transaction processing  
table of contents customer service  and tax reporting 
in the united states  transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year 
in canada  such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year 
accordingly  the level of fees will vary with the growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable 
approximately thousand accounts closed in canada during calendar year and were no longer billable effective may   as compared to approximately thousand accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective may  approximately million accounts closed in the us during calendar year and were no longer billable effective july   as compared to approximately million accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective july  shareholder servicing fees increased in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increases reflect a increase and a increase  respectively  in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts  partially offset by a shift to shareholder accounts that are billable at a lower rate  including shareholder accounts originated in asia

underwriting and distribution expenses increased in fiscal year and in fiscal year consistent with similar trends in underwriting and distribution revenues 
underwriting and distribution expenses for fiscal year included a one time distribution charge of million related to the termination of certain limited partnerships in canada 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefit expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in bonus expense  including bonus expense under the amended and restated annual incentive compensation plan the aip  pursuant to which bonus awards have been made  based  in part  on our performance 
the increase also reflected our annual merit salary adjustments that were effective december  and higher staffing levels 
in fiscal year  we recorded additional charges to compensation and benefits for the repurchase of stock based compensation awards that previously had been recognized as a charge to capital in excess of par value  and for certain employee costs incurred in a business combination that previously had been recognized as goodwill  partially offset by a reduction to compensation and benefit expenses for a previously unrecognized receivable for the estimated refundable portion of workers compensation premiums 
the impact of these adjustments resulted in an additional non cash charge of million pre tax to compensation and benefits in fiscal year we continued to experience a decrease in stock option expense in fiscal year  as compared to prior fiscal year as no new awards have been granted since november compensation and benefit expenses increased in fiscal year primarily as a result of our annual merit salary adjustments that were effective december  and higher staffing levels 
compensation and benefit expenses for fiscal year also included additional expenses related to stock options and the employee stock investment plan resulting from our adoption of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  as well as an increase in other 
table of contents employee benefits 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in expense related to certain performance based bonus plans outside of our amended and restated annual incentive compensation plan 
we continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy 
as such  any changes in the underlying performance of our sponsored investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits going forward 
however  in order to attract and retain talented individuals  our level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue 
we employed approximately  people at september  as compared to approximately  at september  information systems  technology and occupancy information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in external data services costs  technology supplies and software  and higher occupancy costs related to our existing offices worldwide as well as global expansion 
information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal year primarily due to higher occupancy costs related to global expansion and an increase in external data services costs  software and technology consulting 
these increases were partially offset by a continued decrease in depreciation levels associated with a decline in the number and scope of technology projects that were completed and that were therefore subject to amortization 
details of capitalized information systems and technology costs  which exclude occupancy costs  are shown below 
in millions for the fiscal years ended september  net carrying amount at beginning of period additions during period  net of disposals and other adjustments amortization during period net carrying amount at end of period advertising and promotion advertising and promotion expenses increased in fiscal year and in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in marketing support payments made to intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf in the united states 
we are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions  and in order to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities  which means that the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly  or decrease more slowly  than our revenues 
in addition to potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns  advertising and promotion may also be impacted by changes in levels of sales and assets under management that affect marketing support payments made to the distributors of our sponsored investment products 
amortization of deferred sales commissions certain fund share classes sold globally  including class c and class r shares marketed in the united states  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders  although our distribution subsidiaries pay a 
table of contents commission on the sale 
in addition  certain share classes  such as class a shares sold in the united states  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met although our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on these sales 
we defer all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries and amortize them over months to years depending on share class or financing arrangements 
the us funds that had offered class b shares and carried a deferred sales charge arrangement ceased offering these shares to new investors and existing shareholders effective during the quarter ended march  existing class b shareholders may continue to exchange shares into class b shares of different funds and they may also continue to reinvest dividends on class b shares in additional class b shares 
historically  class b and certain of our class c deferred commission assets dca arising from our us  canadian and european operations have been financed through transfers to or other arrangements with lightning finance company limited lfl  a company registered in ireland in which we hold a ownership interest 
in december  lfl transferred substantially all of its dca to lightning asset finance limited lafl  an irish special purpose vehicle formed in december  in which we also hold a ownership interest 
lafl was formed for the sole purpose of acquiring and holding substantially all of the dca owned by lfl as of december  the holder of the ownership interests in both lfl and lafl is a subsidiary of an international banking institution which is not affiliated with the company 
as of december  our dca have been financed generally by an independent third party 
under the u 
s arrangements  the funds contract with our us distributor  which in turn contracted with lfl 
as a result  we maintain a significant interest in both lfl and lafl and continue to carry the dca on our consolidated balance sheets until these assets are amortized or sold by lafl 
neither we nor our distribution subsidiaries retain any direct ownership interest in the dca  and  therefore  the dca are not available to satisfy claims of our creditors or those of our distribution subsidiaries 
in contrast to the us arrangements  the arrangements outside the united states are  in most cases  direct agreements with our canadian and european sponsored investment products  and  as a result  we do not record dca from these sources in our consolidated financial statements 
amortization of deferred sales commissions increased in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increases were consistent with increases in product sales that carry deferred commission charges primarily related to the us and canadian funds 
impairment of intangible assets during the quarter ended december   we completed our most recent annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under the guidance set out in fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and we determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of october  no impairment loss in the fair value of intangible assets subject to amortization was recognized during fiscal year during the quarter ended march   fiduciary trust implemented a plan of reorganization designed to emphasize its distinct high net worth brand and to pursue further integration opportunities within franklin templeton investments for its institutional business line 
these changes to fiduciary trust s business required us to review the carrying value of acquired customer base intangible assets of fiduciary trust 
as a result of these changes  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge to customer base definite lived intangible assets of fiduciary trust in the quarter ended march  
table of contents provision for governmental investigations  proceedings and actions  net in fiscal year  we recognized charges to income aggregating to million million  net of taxes and we received million from our insurance provider for certain legal costs we incurred associated with previously disclosed governmental investigations  proceedings and actions 
other operating expenses other operating expenses primarily consist of professional fees  fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties  corporate travel and entertainment  and other miscellaneous expenses 
other operating expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to higher litigation costs  an increase in fund administration services fees payable to external parties and an increase in consulting and professional fees  including additional costs related to the distribution of market timing settlements 
other operating expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in fund administration services fees payable to external parties  an increase in corporate travel and entertainment  higher costs associated with the resolution of nominal transaction or operational claims  and higher consulting and professional fees 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees  partially due to a decline in costs incurred and reimbursements from our insurance carrier related to governmental investigations  proceedings and actions 
other income expenses other income expenses includes net realized and unrealized investment gains losses on consolidated sponsored investment products  investment and other income  net and interest expense 
investment and other income  net is comprised primarily of income related to our investments  including dividends  interest income  realized gains and losses and income from investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting  as well as minority interest in less than wholly owned subsidiaries and sponsored investments products that we consolidate and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other income expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in realized gains on sale of investments  higher gains on our consolidated sponsored investment products and an increase in income from investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
other income expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in interest income  dividends and realized gains from our investments  as well as a decline in interest expense on our debt 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in minority interest in less than wholly owned subsidiaries  net realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses from our non us operations  and an other than temporary decline in value in certain of our long term investments 
taxes on income as a multi national corporation  we provide investment management and related services to a wide range of international sponsored investment products  often managed from locations outside the united states 
some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the united states 
the mix of pre tax income primarily from our investment management and related services business subject to these lower rates  when aggregated with income originating in the united states  produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing us federal and state income tax rates 

table of contents our effective income tax rate for fiscal year decreased to  as compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to absence of an income tax charge of million related to repatriated earnings of our non us subsidiaries under the jobs act recorded in fiscal year  partially offset by increases in income tax liabilities in certain us state and local tax jurisdictions 
income taxes were provided at a reduced rate for fiscal year primarily due to a favorable us state tax ruling  obtained in fiscal year  which resulted in a refund of tax from multiple prior years 
the effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non us earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity  and sources and uses of capital in millions as of and for the fiscal years ended september  balance sheet data assets liquid assets cash and cash equivalents liabilities commercial paper medium term notes variable funding notes convertible notes other long term debt total debt cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents  current receivables  and current investments trading  available for sale and other 
cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand  debt instruments with maturities of three months or less at the purchase date and other highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash  including money market funds 
cash and cash equivalents at september  decreased from september  primarily due to net cash usage in financing and investing activities  partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows 
at september   the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by our us and us operations were approximately and as compared to approximately and at september  the decrease in total debt outstanding from september  primarily relates to the repayment of commercial paper with a face value of million at maturity in fiscal year and the decline in the other long term liability recognized in relation to the us dca originally financed by lfl 
we experienced higher operating cash flows in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  primarily due to higher net income and higher proceeds from the securitization of loans held for sale  partially offset by higher origination of loans held for sale 
in fiscal year  we experienced net cash outflows in investing activities  as compared to net cash inflows in fiscal year  primarily due to acquisition transactions relating to certain indian subsidiaries as well as an excess purchase of investments 
table of contents over liquidations 
net cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in common stock repurchases  an increase in repayments of debt  net of origination  and a decrease in bank deposits 
capital resources we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity under current credit facilities and the ability to issue debt or equity securities 
in particular  we expect to finance future investment in our banking finance activities through operating cash flows  debt  increased deposit base  and the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities 
at september   we had million available under a five year facility credit agreement with certain banks and financial institutions expiring in the fiscal year ending september  and million of commercial paper also available for issuance 
in addition  at september   our banking finance operating segment had million in available uncommitted short term bank lines of credit under the federal reserve funds system and an aggregate of million in available secured line of credit with the federal reserve bank discount window and federal home loan bank short term borrowing capacity 
our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating  the condition of the global economy  investors willingness to purchase our securities  interest rates  credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets 
in extreme circumstances  we might not be able to access this liquidity readily 
our banking finance operating segment finances its automobile lending business primarily by issuing variable funding notes the variable funding notes under a one year revolving million variable funding note warehouse credit facility and with inter segment loans 
this facility was originally entered into in march  and subsequently extended for additional one year terms in march and march the variable funding notes issued under this facility are payable to certain administered conduits and are secured by cash and a pool of automobile loans that meet or are expected to meet certain eligibility requirements 
credit enhancements for the variable funding notes require us to provide  as collateral  loans held for sale with a fair value in excess of the principal amount of the variable funding notes  as well as to hold in trust additional cash balances to cover certain shortfalls 
in addition  we provide a payment provider commitment in an amount not to exceed of the pool balance 
we also enter into interest rate swap agreements  accounted for as freestanding derivatives  intended to mitigate the interest rate risk between the fixed interest rate on the pool of automobile loans and the floating interest rate being paid on the variable funding notes 
we currently expect to renew or replace the variable funding warehouse credit facility upon its expiration 
our ability to access the securitization and capital markets will directly affect our plans to finance the automobile loan portfolio in the future 
in april  we sold templeton funds annuity company  a wholly owned subsidiary and a life insurance company  for approximately million in cash and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million 
approximately million of the cash proceeds was recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows in fiscal year uses of capital we expect that the main uses of cash will be to expand our core business  make strategic acquisitions  acquire shares of our common stock  fund property and equipment purchases  pay operating expenses of the

our estimated total cost to complete the campus at september  was million  of which million had been incurred as of this date 
we inaugurated the opening of the campus in january and expect to complete the construction of an additional building in fiscal year in april  we acquired the remaining interest in our joint ventures in india  franklin templeton asset management india private limited and franklin templeton trustee services private limited  from an unrelated third party for approximately million 
during fiscal year  we paid regular cash dividends of million

the five year senior notes due april  totaling million medium term notes were reclassified from long term debt to current maturities of long term debt as the contractual maturity of the notes is less than one year from the balance sheet date 
we currently expect to repay the medium term notes at the scheduled maturity date 
we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value 
our stock repurchase program is affected through regular open market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
during fiscal year  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of  million 
the common stock repurchases made as of september  reduced our capital in excess of par value to nil and the excess amount was recognized as a reduction to retained earnings

in particular  under an agreement to outsource the operations of our data centers including responsibility for processing data and managing the centers  which we can terminate at any time  we estimated that the termination fee payable in october  not including costs associated with assuming equipment leases  would approximate million and would decrease each month thereafter  reaching a minimum termination charge of approximately million in july capital contribution commitments relate to our contractual commitments to fund certain of our sponsored investment products 
contingent obligations in relation to the automobile loan securitization transactions that we have entered into with a number of qualified special purpose entities  we are obligated to cover shortfalls in amounts due to note holders up to certain levels as specified in the related agreements 
at september   the maximum potential amount of future payments related to these obligations was million and the fair value of obligations arising from automobile securitization transactions entered into subsequent to december  reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at september  were not significant 
at september   the banking finance operating segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers  primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers 
these standby letters of credit were secured by marketable securities with a fair value of million at september  off balance sheet arrangements as discussed above  we hold a ownership interest in lfl and lafl and we account for the ownership interest in these companies using the equity method of accounting 
as of september   lfl had approximately million in total assets and our exposure to loss related to lfl was limited to the carrying value of our investment  and interest and fees receivable totaling approximately million

neither we nor our distribution subsidiaries retain any direct ownership interest in the dca  and  therefore  the dca are not available to satisfy claims of our creditors or those of our distribution subsidiaries 
as discussed above  our banking finance operating segment periodically enters into automobile loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities  which then issue asset backed securities to private investors see note securitization of loans held for sale in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k

critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
for additional information about our accounting policies  please refer to note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
goodwill and other intangible assets we make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
sfas also requires indefinite lived intangible assets to be tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired 
we perform annual impairment tests in the first quarter of each fiscal year 
goodwill is tested for impairment utilizing a two step process 
the first step requires the identification of the reporting units  and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value is less than the fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is 
table of contents not performed 
if the carrying value is higher than the fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow projections and models similar to those employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
indefinite lived intangible asset impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets  we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow projections to be derived from these assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we test definite lived intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment when there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
in estimating the fair value of intangible assets subject to amortization  we use valuation techniques based on undiscounted cash flow projections  without interest charges  to be derived from these assets 
in performing our impairment analyses  we use certain assumptions and estimates  including those related to discount rates and the expected future period of cash flows to be derived from the assets  based on  among other factors  historical trends and the characteristics of the assets 
while we believe that our testing was appropriate  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise increase amortization expense 
income taxes income taxes are provided for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements  using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as a multinational corporation  we operate in various locations outside the united states and generate earnings from our non us subsidiaries 
at september   and based on tax laws then in effect  it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries  except for previously taxed foreign subsidiary subpart f income and the earnings of material consolidated non us subsidiaries taxed at higher local jurisdiction rates than the us income tax rate 
as a result  we have not made a provision for us taxes and have not recorded a deferred tax liability on billion of cumulative undistributed earnings recorded by non us subsidiaries at september  changes to our policy of reinvesting non us earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of investments we record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
where available  we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do 
table of contents not have readily determinable fair values  we estimate the value of the securities based upon available information 
however  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  some assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for example  we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current carrying value 
we evaluate our investments for other than temporary decline in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the carrying value for an extended period of time 
as most of our investments are carried at fair value  if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist in available for sale securities  the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined 
we classify securities as trading when it is management s intent at the time of purchase to sell the security within a short period of time 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized as gains and losses currently in earnings 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements 
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of september  to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount 
see also note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
consolidation of variable interest entities under fin r  a variable interest entity vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment 
fin r requires consolidation of a vie by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership  referred to as the primary beneficiary 
we evaluate whether related entities are vies and determine if we qualify as the primary beneficiary of these vies 
these evaluations are highly complex and involve judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions 
to determine our interest in the expected losses or residual returns of vies  we utilize expected cash flow scenarios that include discount rate and volatility assumptions that are based on available historical information and management s estimates 
based on our analysis  we determined that we have no vies to consolidate in our financial statements as of september  while we believe that our testing and approach are appropriate  future changes in estimates and assumptions may affect whether certain related entities are consolidated in our financial statements under fin r

table of contents our banking finance operating segment is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its loans receivable  debt securities held  and deposit liabilities 
in our banking finance operating segment  we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets  as well as funding sources and  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate interest rate exposure see note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
our investment management and related services operating segment is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily through its investment in debt securities and its outstanding debt 
we minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities  and through diversification 
in addition  we seek to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our outstanding debt by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates 
at september   we have considered the potential impact of a movement in market interest rates in relation to the banking finance segment interest earning assets  net of interest bearing liabilities  total debt outstanding and our portfolio of debt securities  individually and in the aggregate 
based on our analysis  we do not expect that this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations 
we operate primarily in the united states  but also provide services and earn revenues in the bahamas  asia  canada  europe  latin america  africa and australia 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is minimized since a significant portion of these revenues and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the united states 
we are exposed to market valuation risks related to securities we hold that are carried at fair value and investments held by majority owned sponsored investment products that we consolidate  which are also carried at fair value 
to mitigate this risk  we maintain a diversified investment portfolio and  from time to time  we may enter into derivative agreements see note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
our exposure to market valuation risks are also minimized as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions
