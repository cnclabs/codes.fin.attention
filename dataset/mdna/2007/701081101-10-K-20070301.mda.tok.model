item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview our us gulf of mexico operations and rental tools business shouldered our percent increase in operating results for over giving us the opportunity to provide improved performance even as we transition our international operations to new long term contracts 
demand for our services continued to be robust in spite of the wide fluctuation in energy commodity prices experienced throughout we expect to have continued strong results in as well 
drilling and rental operating income was up million  even though overall drilling operations utilization was percent  down from percent in dayrates in the us gulf of mexico market increased percent  and we moved two land rigs into the us land market from mexico at significantly higher dayrates 
utilization in the us markets was down slightly at percent in from percent in  as we had downtime for barge rig while we upgraded it from workover to deep drilling status and completed planned maintenance and improvements for three other barge rigs 
our new ultra deep drilling barge  rig which is capable of drilling in both ultra shallow and open water commenced operation in december under two consecutive three month terms 
rental tools revenues also improved providing a million increase in operating profit 
in international markets  we had percent utilization in percent in as rigs mexico  kazakhstan and turkmenistan in our existing fleet completed long term contracts and experienced downtime as the rigs were repositioned to new markets 
in addition we sold our two nigerian barge rigs in august four land rigs transitioned from mexico to new contracts  two to the us and two to colombia  all of which commenced in rig  released from our tengiz chevroil tco contract and rig  released in turkmenistan  both returned to work under new contracts in rig in mexico had no downtime as we negotiated a new  nine month contract in june and subsequently a new two year contract effective in march at current market rates 
we also had strong results in papua new guinea and bangladesh and on our operations and maintenance o m contracts in russia as all of these operations were in place all year 
benefits from our debt reduction program initiative continued to pay off in as interest expense declined by million and debt extinguishment costs by million during versus on debt reductions of million in  following the million and million reductions accomplished during and  respectively 
gains on sales of assets declined as sales reflect primarily our corporate strategy to exit nigeria 
sales in included the wrap up of our asset sales program that was an integral part of our debt reduction program 
outlook strong results are anticipated in as our us operations are expected to be steady throughout drilling barge rig completed its refurbishment program in november and began operating under a six month contract  and rig will begin a month contract in april 
we will also have the benefit of our new rental tool facility that will open in texarkana in march to serve the barnett and fayetteville shale areas in east texas and oklahoma  respectively 
in addition to the benefit of a full year of long term international contracts negotiated in  we expect our working rig count in the cis region to grow by three rigs during the third quarter 
once upgrades are completed on rig  a fourth rig could re enter that market by the second quarter of we expect both rigs in papua new guinea to operate all of rig contract terms were extended for two years to drill in new zealand 
we are pursuing several projects in mexico and our africa middle east region  including expansion into libya 
we will have grown our fleet by over percent over with newly constructed rigs and rigs under joint venture projects 
two of our four new  hp rigs were delivered to algeria in early and are expected to commence operations in the first and second quarters 
our joint venture in saudi arabia  which 
table of contents results of operations continued outlook continued has a drilling contract for three years with a one year extension option  has expanded from four rigs to six 
expected spud dates for these rigs range from the second quarter of through the end of in august  we were awarded a technical service project to provide the conceptual design for a drilling rig for use in bp s liberty field in the alaskan beaufort sea 
in january  we expanded this contract with bp to design and procure long lead time equipment for the rig 
this rig will initially be located on a satellite drilling island and will be capable of drilling extended reach wells in excess of  feet 
oil and gas price levels significantly impact exploration and production activity which in turn  impact both our contract drilling and rental tools revenues 
in us markets  drilling contracts are generally short term  which has allowed us to benefit from rising prices over the last three years 
to mitigate the risks from future changes in market conditions  we have been negotiating longer term contracts in us markets where possible 
in international markets  contracts are generally longer term and insulate us somewhat from short term price fluctuations 
over extended periods  however  international market conditions typically follow the demand for oil 
under our strategic plan  we have embarked on a construction program to build preferred rigs that will remain in demand regardless of business cycle that should help us maintain high utilization in periods of lower drilling activity 
we also leverage ourselves with our significant international experience and our safety record  which continues to be one of the lowest total incident rates in our industry from a safety  training and preventive maintenance perspective 
our safety record continues to be one of the best in our industry 
international markets also present the challenges of foreign regulation and civil unrest  which we continually monitor and apply risk management strategies to minimize 
our rigs are also subject to a range of potential incidents 
although we insure against these risks  the cost and availability of insurance are subject to significant change that is not subject to our control 
we continuously refine our quality assurance  health  safety and environmental programs to help prevent future well control incidents 
our operating margins must also cover interest expense and income taxes 
we have significantly reduced our interest and financial costs with approximately million of debt reduction and subsequent lowering of interest expense over the last three years 
we are currently completing a worldwide corporate reorganization that is designed to help us more efficiently manage our operations 
the reorganization will also help us achieve greater tax efficiencies through the establishment of a holding company structure based in the netherlands 
laws in various jurisdictions will continue to evolve  and the company will continue to review and adapt as necessary 
while many of our current rig construction projects are coming into fruition early in  we do face delay  cost overrun and quality risks with regard to our rig construction projects 
we manage these risks through contractual provisions and project management strategies 
all major components have detailed specifications and construction standards that must be met before we accept delivery 
retaining qualified  trained crews to operate our rigs has been challenging globally  with the increase in the number of rigs operating  creating competing job opportunities for our personnel 
we have responded with competitive compensation programs designed to reduce attrition for critical personnel 
in addition  with our training programs and facilities  we are able to promote from within and will continue to emphasize these training programs and our safety record to attract the necessary personnel 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the results reflect a reversal of a million valuation allowance and the current year utilization of million of nol s  both related to louisiana state net operating loss carryforwards nol

the gross margin amounts excluding depreciation and amortization and gross margin percentages should not be used as a substitute for those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
however  we monitor our business segments based on several criteria  including drilling and rental gross margin 
management believes that this information is useful to our investors because it more accurately reflects cash generated by segment 
such gross margin amounts are reconciled to our most comparable gaap measure as follows international us drilling drilling rental tools dollars in thousands year ended december  drilling and rental operating income depreciation and amortization drilling and rental gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization year ended december  drilling and rental operating income depreciation and amortization drilling and rental gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization drilling and rental operating income drilling and rental revenues less direct drilling and rental operating expenses  including depreciation and amortization expense 

table of contents results of operations continued us drilling segment revenues for the us drilling segment increased million to million as compared to the year ended december  the increased revenues were primarily due to a million increase for our barge drilling operations where we had higher dayrates  that more than offset lower utilization 
barge rig was undergoing an upgrade from workover to deep drilling status until late may and we also had maintenance and upgrade time for barge rigs  and newly constructed barge rig also began operations in december during the last half of we also repositioned two international land rigs into the us market which contributed million to the increase in us drilling segment revenues 
as of december  this segment consisted of barge rigs ten deep drilling barge rigs  four intermediate drilling barge rigs and five workover barge rigs  and two land rigs 
two of the workover barge rigs are reflected as assets held for sale as of december  and were sold in early january see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
average dayrates for the deep drilling barge rigs increased approximately  per day in as compared to as a result of approximately percent higher dayrates on all barge rigs  the addition of two land rigs and effective operating cost controls  gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization increased million to million 
gross margin percentages excluding depreciation and amortization increased from percent during the year ended to percent during the year ended of this increase includes million from the two land rigs discussed above as compared to which included start up costs for the barge rig transition from nigeria 
international drilling segment international drilling revenues decreased million to million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to the completion of long term contracts and the transition to new contracts throughout the year 
international land drilling revenues decreased million and offshore operations declined million 
the international land drilling revenues decrease is attributable primarily to completion of contracts in mexico million  kazakhstan tco contract million  and the partial completion of our contracts in turkmenistan million  resulting in the release of two of three rigs  and new zealand million due to downtime for rig in the second quarter of the sale in of rigs in colombia and peru also caused a decline of million in revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by increases from new international land contracts  a portion of which are attributable to release of above mentioned rigs that were re located to other operating areas 
in the cis region  the overall decline in land drilling revenues during the year ended was million 
declines included the kazakhstan tco project completion million  the completion of wells for two rigs in turkmenistan million  mentioned above and a decline of million in russia as the result of contract completion in mid revenues increased million in the cis region for our o m contracts 
our orlan project contributed million to the increase as the contract was fully operational for the entire year in and our rig sakhalin island project contributed million  as both dayrates and services provided increased 
in the karachaganak area of kazakhstan  revenues increased by million due to the addition of rig which was transitioned from the tco project  which began drilling in late march an increase in revenue of million in papua new guinea is the result of the operation of two full o m contracts for the year ended in  whereas they were only labor contracts in with full o m operations not commencing until late in the third quarter of also  rig drilled all of  whereas it did not drill in  and we negotiated a rate increase on rig effective june in indonesia  increased revenues were due to higher utilization as two rigs operated most of  whereas the rigs were on reduced rates until june in revenues in bangladesh increased million due to operation of rig in  whereas operations were suspended due to a well control incident in late june revenues were down 
table of contents results of operations continued international drilling segment continued million in new zealand due primarily to lower operating and reimbursable revenues relating to rig which was idle during the second quarter of international offshore revenues declined million to million during as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to the reduced force majeure rates applicable to our nigerian barge rigs during the first half of and the sale of these rigs in the third quarter of and lower revenues on rig in the caspian sea areas due to maintenance days 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in revenues for our barge rig in mexico due to higher dayrates 
gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization for our international operations decreased by million due to the completion of contracts in mexico  tco  and in turkmenistan  and as a result of the sale of rigs in peru and colombia in the second and third quarters of these decreases were partially offset by increases on our o m contracts in the russian and the cis regions and increases in papua new guinea  where we had higher dayrates for rig  increased contributions from o m contracts and operation of rig in rental tools segment rental tools revenues increased million or percent to million during the year ended december  as compared to revenues increased at all us locations as we added new customers and increased rentals from our existing customers and achieved higher rental rates 
rental tools gross margins excluding depreciation and amortization increased million or percent to million for the current period as compared to other financial data general and administration expense increased approximately million in due primarily to additional stock based compensation expense 
gain on disposition of assets in was million relating primarily to a gain on the sale of our two barge rigs in nigeria and final insurance recoveries relating to damage on rig in bangladesh and rig in the us gulf of mexico which occurred in during  gain on disposition of assets was million  including million from our asset sales program that was completed in the third quarter of and million from insurance proceeds on the loss of rig interest expense declined million during as compared to due primarily to the reduction of outstanding debt throughout of million and further reduction of million during in addition  we capitalized million of interest related to new rig construction in loss on extinguishment of debt declined by million as a result of the significant reduction of debt in interest income increased million due to a higher cash balance in as compared to  due primarily to proceeds from our stock offering in january  higher cash flow from operations  and higher interest rates 
in  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements  which are still outstanding 
the swap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  we are reporting the mark to market change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives currently in earnings 
for  there was no significant change in the fair value of the derivative positions and for  there was a million increase in fair value during the year

table of contents results of operations continued other financial data continued the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate of percent is lower than the us federal and state statutory rates due primarily to the benefit of million related to the state net operating loss nol carryforwards and the current year utilization of million of state nol s 
our effective tax rate of in is primarily due to the reversal of the million valuation allowance related to federal nol carryforwards 
foreign taxes decreased million in due primarily to a reduction of taxes in kazakhstan  south america and nigeria offset by an increase in taxes associated with continuing operations in new zealand  mexico and russia

us drilling segment us drilling revenues increased million in to million due to higher utilization and dayrates 
despite the destruction caused by hurricanes katrina and rita  our us gulf of mexico rigs sustained no material damage or downtime 
barge rigs and returned to service in late november after undergoing minor repairs and scheduled maintenance 
barge rig  which turned over during a move from the path of hurricane dennis in july  sustained additional damage during hurricanes katrina and rita 
equipment on the rig was impaired by million  in the fourth quarter of average utilization for the barge rigs increased to percent from an average utilization during of percent 
average dayrates for the deep drilling barge rigs increased approximately  per day as compared to overall  rate increases on all barge rigs accounted for million of the revenue increase  and increased utilization accounted for approximately million of the increase 
as a result of higher dayrates and utilization  gross margins excluding depreciation and amortization in the us drilling segment increased million to million 
international drilling segment international drilling revenues increased million to million in as compared to international land drilling revenues increased million to million and international offshore drilling revenues increased by million to million 
international drilling gross margins excluding depreciation and amortization increased by million to million due to a million increase for international offshore and million for international land operations 
international land drilling results in improved primarily due to our operations in mexico  the asia pacific countries of new zealand  papua new guinea and indonesia and on our sakhalin island o m contracts in the cis region 
we completed our sale of certain latin america assets previously operating in colombia  bolivia and peru in the third quarter of the remaining seven latin american land rigs were moved to mexico in the second and third quarters of and worked throughout under contract with halliburton de mexico halliburton 
revenues for these rigs increased by million to million due to the full year of operation in the asset sales and move of rigs  combined for a decrease in revenues for the referenced latin america countries of million 

table of contents results of operations continued international drilling segment continued in our asia pacific region  revenues increased by million as a result of percent utilization for all three rigs in new zealand compared to percent in and higher dayrates in  and utilization of percent in as compared to percent in for the two rigs in papua new guinea and higher dayrates in  partially offset by a million decline in bangladesh in as compared to due to the loss of our rig in a late june well control incident

construction on this rig was completed in the second quarter of and full crews under our contract began in late september o m revenues under our five year service contract on rig  sakhalin island  increased by million to million 
revenues also increased million in turkmenistan due to the addition of a third rig that began drilling in the third quarter of  offset partially by a decrease in revenues on rig which suffered a well control incident in november due to the move of rig to turkmenistan in  revenues in russia declined by million in as the rig worked approximately six months in revenues also declined million on our tco contract as the scope of work under that contract was cut back with one tco owned rig released in late  one in the third quarter of and rates reduced on rig  which was released in early january international land gross margins excluding depreciation and amortization increased million in when compared to the increase is primarily the result of a full year of operations in mexico million and increased activity  as noted previously  related to our orlan project in the cis region million and in new zealand million  papua new guinea million and indonesia million in the asia pacific region  offset partially by a decline related to our tco contract of million as previously discussed 
international offshore drilling revenues increased million to million in as compared to the increase in revenues is attributable to a million increase in the caspian sea operation reflecting activation of barge rig in late  whereas it had been stacked during most of and a million increase for our offshore rig in mexico as a result of a full year of operation in our nigerian operations had a million increase in revenues due to less downtime in international offshore gross margins excluding depreciation and amortization increased million in as compared to the increase is due to the operation of our rig in the caspian sea million as mentioned above  whereas the rig was stacked in costs to maintain the rig in a stacked condition were approximately million per quarter in and we also settled an assessment of duties  taxes and penalties for this rig with the customs control in mangistau  kazakhstan  in the third quarter of for million 
in nigeria  the gross margin before depreciation and amortization increased million as our two rigs operated most of the year versus lower utilization in and costs to maintain the barges in stacked condition and increased insurance costs caused by losses incurred 
in addition  nigerian tax authorities assessed additional value added tax vat  resulting in a charge of million in the second quarter of mexico offshore gross margin before depreciation and amortization increased by million in due to a full year of operations as compared to seven months in rental tools segment rental tools revenues increased million to million in the increase in revenues was attributable to a percent increase in rentals  a percent increase in rental tools sales  a percent increase in transportation revenues and a percent increase in repair revenues 
increases were achieved at all locations  including a million increase from our operations in new iberia  louisiana  million in victoria  texas  million in odessa  texas  million in evanston  wyoming and million from international sources 
gross margins excluding depreciation and amortization increased million due to the increased volume of business and granting of fewer discounts off listed rental prices 

table of contents results of operations continued other financial data depreciation and amortization expense decreased million to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to asset sales completed during the year 
general and administrative expense increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the increase is due to the accelerated vesting of certain restricted stock in including our portion of payroll related taxes  amortization on the issuance of additional restricted stock in the second quarter  higher compensation costs and higher staffing levels related to increased operating levels 
during  we recognized a provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets of million as compared to million in damage to barge rig in a july towing incident in preparation for a hurricane totaled approximately million 
we also wrote off the remaining million relating to premiums paid on a life insurance policy for robert l 
parker sr  former chairman of the board and director 
during  we impaired two domestic workover barge rigs that were not marketable for million  impaired two rigs in the amount million in the asia pacific region  and recorded an impairment of million to reduce the carrying value of all assets to net realizable value in latin america in advance of the sale of the assets 
during the second quarter of  we reclassified our latin america assets from discontinued operations to continuing operations as the assets had not sold within a year  or had a sale pending within a year 
we recognized a million charge to adjust the value of these assets to their fair value 
the million represents the depreciation that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used 
in addition  during we reserved million for an asset representing premiums paid in prior years on two split dollar life insurance policies for robert l 
parker 
the value of the asset was reduced and ultimately written off in relation to one of the policies as noted above 
gain on disposition of assets increased to million in as compared to million in the gain in was comprised of a million gain on sale of latin america assets  million gain on the well control insurance proceeds related to rig in bangladesh and other miscellaneous asset sales of million 
in  the million gain was comprised of million gain on the disposal of barge rig in nigeria and million on sale of tubulars and scrap equipment 
interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the decrease in interest expense is attributable to the reduction of million of our outstanding debt balance in  the full year benefit from debt reductions and lower interest rates 
in  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  we are reporting the mark to market change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives currently in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash increase in the fair value of the derivative positions of million  as compared to a decrease in the fair value of the derivative position of million in loss on extinguishment of debt was million in compared to million in  as we reduced outstanding debt and exchanged higher interest rate debt for lower interest rate debt in both years 
in february  we repurchased million of our senior notes with the proceeds received from the sale of jackup rig and cash on hand  recognizing an expense of million for the percent redemption price on the repurchase of the notes and capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the notes 
in april  we issued an additional million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due at a premium 
the offering price of percent of the principal amount resulted in gross proceeds of million 
the million premium is recognized as long term debt and is being amortized over the term of the notes 
the additional notes were issued under an indenture dated october   under which million in aggregate principal amount of notes in the same series were previously issued 
on the same date that we issued the million additional senior notes  we issued a redemption notice for million of our senior notes at the redemption price of percent  resulting in a million loss on the extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of during the third quarter of

foreign taxes decreased million in due primarily to a reduction of taxes in kazakhstan offset by an increase in taxes related to the sale of the latin america rigs and start up of the orlan project in russia 
our effective income tax rates for financial reporting purposes were approximately percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax of percent is lower than due primarily to the reversal of the valuation allowance related to federal nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us the valuation allowance was originally recorded in accordance with gaap as an offset to our deferred tax assets  which consisted primarily of nol carryforwards 
gaap requires us to recognize a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that we could realize the benefit of the nol carryforwards and deferred tax assets in future periods 
having returned to profitability in  we now expect that earnings performance should allow us to benefit from the nol carryforwards  and therefore  the previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required 
the valuation allowance and net deferred tax asset benefit was million resulting from the reversal of the previously established valuation allowance of million and net deferred tax assets and tax benefit from tax return filings 
the reduction in foreign taxes  net of federal benefit  in from relates to a federal tax deduction on actual foreign cash taxes paid versus accrued foreign taxes 
the increase in income tax on foreign corporate income in is due to the increase in earnings on our foreign corporations and the related recognition of us taxes on the earnings

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the 
table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  materials and supplies obsolescence  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  workers compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that such estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they are complex and require significant judgments  assumptions and or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we periodically evaluate our property  plant and equipment to ensure that the net carrying value is not in excess of the net realizable value 
we review our property  plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired 
for example  evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future  or when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we consider a number of factors  including estimated undiscounted future cash flows  appraisals less estimated selling costs and current market value analysis in determining net realizable value 
assets are written down to fair value if the fair value is below net carrying value 
we recorded impairments to our long lived assets of million and million in and  respectively 
we also recorded million of impairments to our discontinued operations assets in asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets 
impairment of goodwill 
we periodically assess whether the excess of cost over net assets acquired goodwill is impaired based generally on the estimated future cash flows of that operation 
if the estimated fair value is in excess of the carrying value of the operation  no further analysis is performed 
if the fair value of each operation to which goodwill has been assigned is less than its carrying value  we deduct the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and compare the residual amount to the carrying value of the goodwill to determine if impairment should be recorded 
changes in dayrate and utilization assumptions used in the fair value calculations could result in fair value estimates that are below carrying value  resulting in an impairment of goodwill 
we also test for impairment based on events or changes in circumstances that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill 
our annual impairment tests of goodwill for  and indicated that the fair value of operations to which goodwill relates exceeded the carrying values as of december   and  accordingly  no impairments were recorded 
insurance reserves 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent to the drilling industry  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of 
table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
based on the risks discussed above  we estimate our liability in excess of insurance coverage and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from the amounts estimated 
we accrue actuarially determined amounts in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation  employers liability  general liability  automobile liability claims and health benefits 
these accruals use historical data based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims to project future losses 
these estimates and accruals have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
as the determination of our liability for insurance claims could be material and is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical 
accounting for income taxes 
we are a us company and we operate through our various foreign branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world 
consequently  our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary 
therefore  as a part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  nonresident withholding taxes or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities  as well as the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income  where rigs will be deployed and other matters 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances  including as discussed below 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of our nol carryforwards 
as a result of our expected earnings performance which should allow us to benefit from the nol carryforwards  we have concluded that no valuation allowance is currently required 
we will reevaluate our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards in future periods and  in compliance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  we will record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
we have provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our us and foreign subsidiaries as the earnings are not permanently reinvested 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues and expenses on dayrate contracts as drilling progresses 
for meterage contracts  which are rare  we recognize the revenues and expenses upon completion of the well 
revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six 
table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued months 
mobilization fees received and related mobilization costs incurred are deferred and amortized over the term of the contract period 
accounting for derivative instruments 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas established accounting and disclosure requirements for most derivative instruments and hedge transactions involving derivatives 
sfas also requires formal documentation procedures for hedging relationships and effectiveness testing when hedge accounting is to be applied 
in  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on our senior floating rate notes 
the interest rate swap agreements provide us with interest rate protection on the senior floating rate notes due we do not use hedge accounting treatment for these interest rate swap agreements as we determined that the hedges would not be highly effective as defined by sfas the ineffectiveness of the hedges is caused by embedded written call options in the interest rate swap agreements that do not exist in the notes 
accordingly  we recognize the volatility of the swap agreements on a mark to market basis in our consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended december   there was no significant change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash increase in the fair value of million 
these non cash items are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as changes in fair value of derivative positions 
the fair market value adjustment of these swap agreements will generally fluctuate based on the implied forward interest rate curve for the three month libor 
if the implied forward interest rate curve decreases  the fair market value of the interest swap agreements will decrease and we will record an additional charge 
if the implied forward interest rate curve increases  the fair market value of the interest swap agreements will increase  and we will record income 
we analyze the position of the swap agreements on a monthly basis and record the mark to market impact based on the analysis
