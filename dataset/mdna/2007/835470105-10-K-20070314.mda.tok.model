references to we  our  and us refer to sonicwall  inc and its subsidiaries 
overview sonicwall provides network security  content security  and business continuity solutions for businesses of all sizes 
our solutions are typically deployed at the edges of  and within small to medium sized local area networks 
these networks are often aggregated into broader distributed deployments to support companies that do business in multiple physical locations  interconnect their networks with trading partners  or support a mobile or remote workforce 
our solutions are sold in over countries worldwide 

table of contents we generate revenue primarily from the sale of four items products  software licenses  subscriptions for services such as content filtering  anti virus protection and intrusion prevention  offsite data backup  email protection  and other services such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
we currently outsource our hardware manufacturing and assembly to contract manufacturers 
flash electronics manufactures and assembles many of our products at facilities in both the us and china 
sercomm corporation of taiwan manufactures and assembles certain of our products at facilities located in taiwan 
outsourcing our manufacturing and assembly enables us to reduce fixed overhead and personnel costs and to provide flexibility in meeting market demand 
we design and develop the key components for the majority of our products 
in addition  we generally determine the components that are incorporated in our products and select the appropriate suppliers of these components 
product testing and burn in are performed by our contract manufacturer using tests that we typically specify 
we sell our solutions primarily through distributors and value added resellers  who in turn sell our products to end users 
some of our resellers are carriers or service providers who provide solutions to the end user customers as managed services 
we seek to provide our channel partners and customers with differentiated solutions that are innovative  easy to use  reliable  and provide good value 
to support this commitment  we dedicate significant resources to developing new products and marketing our products to our channel partners and customers 
key success factors of our business we believe that there are several key success factors of our business  and that we create value in our business by focusing on our execution in these areas 
channel our distributors and resellers provide a valuable service in assisting end users in the design  implementation  and service of our network security  content security  and business continuity solutions 
we support our distribution and channel partners with sales  marketing  and technical support to help them create and fulfill demand for our offerings 
we also focus on helping our channel partners succeed with our solutions by concentrating on comprehensive reseller training and certification  and support for our channel s sales activities 
product and service platform our products serve as a platform for revenue generation for both us and our channel partners 
each product sale can result in additional revenue through the simultaneous or subsequent sale of add on software licenses  such as our global management system  or through the sale of additional value added subscription services  such as content filtering  client anti virus and integrated gateway anti virus  anti spyware and intrusion prevention services  email protection and off site data backup 
we plan to introduce more service options for our platforms  which will allow us to generate additional revenue from both our installed base of platforms as well as from those services coupled to incremental product sales 
distributed architecture our security solutions are based on a distributed architecture  which we believe allows our offerings to be deployed and managed at the most efficient location in the network 
we are providing our customers and their service providers with mechanisms to enforce the networking and security policies they have defined for their business 
we also use the flexibility of a distributed architecture to allow us to enable new functionality in already deployed platforms through the provisioning of an electronic key  which may be distributed through the internet 

table of contents market acceptance we began offering integrated security appliances in  and since that time we have shipped approximately  revenue units 
when measured by units shipped  we are typically among the top three suppliers in the markets in which we compete 
our experience in serving a broad market and our installed base of customers provides us with opportunities to sell our new network security  content security  and business continuity solutions as they become available 
the market acceptance of our current solutions provides our current and prospective channel partners with an increased level of comfort when deciding to offer our new solutions to their customers 
integrated design our platforms utilize a highly integrated design in order to improve ease of use  lower acquisition and operational costs for our customers  and enhance performance 
various models also integrate functionality to support different internet connection alternatives 
every appliance also ships with pre loaded firmware to provide for rapid set up and easy installation 
each of these tasks can be managed through a simple web browser session 
our opportunities  challenges  and risks we serve substantial and growing markets for network security  content security  and business continuity 
our goal is to deliver comprehensive and profitable solutions to our channel partners which address their customers needs 
we pursue the creation of these solutions through a blend of organic and inorganic growth strategies including internal development efforts  licensing and oem opportunities  and acquisition of other companies 
to the extent that these efforts result in solutions which fit well with our channel and end users  we would expect to generate increasing sales 
to the extent that these efforts are not successful  we would expect to see loss of sales and or increased expenses without commensurate return 
international growth we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in the foreseeable future 
our percentage of sales from international territories does not represent the same degree of penetration of those markets as we have achieved domestically 
we believe that a significant opportunity exists to grow our revenue by increasing our international penetration rate to match the current domestic penetration rate 
if we fail to structure our distribution relationships in a manner consistent with marketplace requirements and on favorable terms  the percentage of sales from international territories will decline and the revenue from our international operations may decrease 
license and services revenue we believe that the software license and services component of our revenue has several characteristics that are positive for our business as a whole our license and services revenue is associated with a higher gross profit than our product revenue  the subscription services component of license and services revenue is recognized ratably over the services period  and thus provides  in the aggregate  a more predictable revenue stream than product revenue  which is generally recognized at the time of the sale  and to the extent that we are able to achieve good renewal rates  we have the opportunity to lower our selling and marketing expenses attributable to that segment 
we have increased the rate at which we have been able to license our software and sell our services to both our installed base and in conjunction with our new solution sales 
as a result  we have been able to generate incremental revenue out of each product transaction 
we expect the percentage of our total revenue from license and services to continue to grow 
however  should we not achieve reasonable rates of selling associated services to our installed base or as part of new solution sales  or realize lower subscription service renewal rates  we risk having our revenue concentrated in more unpredictable product and license sales 
macro economic factors affecting it spending we believe that our products and services are subject to the macro economic factors that affect much of the information technology it market 
growing it budgets and an increased funding for projects to provide 
table of contents security  mobility  data protection  and productivity could drive product upgrade cycles and or create demand for new applications of our solutions 
contractions in it spending can affect our revenue by causing projects incorporating our products and services to be delayed and or canceled 
we believe that demand for our solutions correlate with increases or decreases in global it spending 
critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that the judgments  assumptions  and estimates upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these judgments  assumptions  and estimates are made 
however  any differences between these judgments  assumptions  and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our statement of operations and financial condition 
the accounting policies that reflect our most significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates and which we believe are critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  and warranty reserve  valuation of inventory  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and share based compensation 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenue primarily from the sale of the four items product  software licenses  subscriptions for services such as content filtering  anti virus protection  and intrusion prevention  and other services such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting  and engineering services 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
the company may experience material differences in the amount and timing of its revenue for any period if the management makes different judgments or utilize different estimates 
the company recognizes product and service revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
a  sab no 
b  sab  and eitf the company applies provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop no 
 as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop no 
 to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
for hardware transactions where software is incidental  the company does not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
the company applies the provisions of emerging issues task force  applicability of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software eitf  to determine whether the provisions of sop apply to transactions involving the sale of products that include a software component 
the company recognizes revenue for products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
while the company s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
in these cases  interpretation of non standard provisions is required to determine the appropriate accounting for the transaction 
retroactive price protection rights tied to certain specific circumstances are contractually offered to the company s channel partners 
the company evaluates these rights carefully based on stock on hand in the channels that has been purchased within days of the price change with the exception of ingram micro and tech data 
revenue from these two distributors is not recognized until they sell the product to their customers 
as a consequence  any requirement to provide price protection credits to these two distributors does not adversely impact previously recognized revenue 
in general  retroactive price adjustments are infrequent in nature 
at december  and  the company had a reserve for price protection in the amounts of  and  respectively 

table of contents delivery to domestic channel partners and international channel partners is generally deemed to occur when we deliver the product to a common carrier 
however  certain distributor agreements provide for rights of return for stock rotation 
these stock rotation rights are generally limited to to of the distributor s prior to months purchases or other measurable restrictions  and we estimate reserves for these return rights as discussed below 
two of our largest distributors  ingram micro and tech data  have rights of return under certain circumstances that are not limited  therefore  we do not deem delivery to have occurred for any sales to ingram micro and tech data until they sell the product to their customers 
evidence of an arrangement is manifested by a master distribution or oem agreement  an individual binding purchase order  or a signed license agreement 
in most cases  sales through our distributors and oem partners are governed by a master agreement against which individual binding purchase orders are placed on a transaction by transaction basis 
at the time of the transaction  the company assesses whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable  and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the company assesses whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon of the terms of the binding purchase order  including the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due beyond the company s normal payment terms  which are generally to days from invoice date  the company accounts for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  the company recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with  and credit worthiness of  the distributor or reseller 
the company does not request collateral from our distributors or resellers 
if the company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  it defers the fee and recognizes revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  the sale of an appliance which includes maintenance or a subscription based product  the company allocates revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  which is generally the average selling price of each element when sold separately 
this allocation process means that the company defers revenue from the arrangement equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognizes such amounts as revenue when the elements are delivered 
the company s arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  recognition of revenue occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
the company recognizes revenue for subscriptions and services  such as content filtering  anti virus protection and intrusion prevention  and extended warranty and service contracts  ratably over the contract term 
the company s training  consulting and engineering services are generally billed and recognized as revenue as these services are performed 
sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  and warranty reserve the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must make estimates of potential future product returns and price changes related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we may experience material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
in addition  we must make estimates based upon a combination of factors to ensure that our accounts receivable balances are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  the length of time receivables are past due  macroeconomic conditions  deterioration in 
table of contents customer s operating results or financial position  customer concentrations  and customer credit worthiness  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our appliance products are generally covered by a warranty for a one to two year period 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services  including the cost of technical support  product repairs  and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired 
our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
valuation of inventory we continually assess the valuation of our inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are difficult to make since they are based  in part  on estimates of current and future economic conditions 
reviews for excess inventory are done on a quarterly basis and required reserve levels are calculated with reference to our projected ultimate usage of that inventory 
in order to determine the ultimate usage  we take into account forecasted demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycles  projected obsolescence  current inventory levels  and purchase commitments 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand  and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative effect on our gross profit and earnings 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at december  based upon our determination that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized in the foreseeable future due to historical operating losses 
the net operating losses and research and development tax carryovers that make the vast majority of the deferred tax asset will expire at various dates through the year going forward  we will assess the continued need for the valuation allowance 
after we have demonstrated profitability for a period of time and begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  we may reverse the valuation allowance  likely resulting in a significant benefit to the statement of operations in some future period 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate when this reversal might occur  if at all 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill purchased intangibles consist of purchased technology  customer installed base relationships  customer backlog and other intangibles 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from months to six years 
amortization of intangible assets was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash 
table of contents flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired by the company 
goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred 
an impairment charge is recognized if a reporting unit s goodwill carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step approach in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets using one or more of the following fair value measures including present value techniques of estimated future cash flows  or valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue  or a similar performance measure 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
based on the impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill in   and the goodwill recorded as a result of the business combinations in the years presented is not deductible for tax purposes 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we record an impairment charge based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
share based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation revised sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb for periods beginning in fiscal in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was million which consisted of share based compensation expense related to employee stock options in the amount of million and expense related to employee stock purchases in the amount of  the total compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized at december  was million and the weighted average period over which the total compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized is expected to be recognized was years 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december   is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro 
table of contents forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we continued to use the straight line single option method 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in the pro forma information required under sfas for the periods prior to fiscal  we have accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
upon adoption of sfas r  we continued to use the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model which was previously used for the company s pro forma information required under sfas our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in management s opinion  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r and sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction

we expect new products to be a continuing source of additional revenue 
the decrease in product revenue in as compared to was primarily due to the mix of sales in all regions shifting to lower price point products  and a decline in the average sales price per unit of tz and pro product families 
these effects were partially offset by an increase in the number of tz units sold  the introduction of certain bundled product solutions  the introduction of sonicpoint g wireless access points and the csm license and service revenue license and service revenue is derived primarily from licensing of software products  such as our global management system  enhancements to our sonicos operating system  node upgrades  sales of subscription services such as content filtering  email security  client anti virus and integrated gateway anti virus  anti spyware  and intrusion prevention  and extended service contracts 
in addition  we generate license and service revenue from the sale of extended service contracts and professional services related to training  consulting  and engineering services 
we have experienced significant year over year growth in license and services revenue and expect the market opportunity for our license and subscription service offerings  in particular  to grow as customer awareness around the dynamic requirements of unified network threat prevention and management becomes more pervasive 
in addition  there is an opportunity to sell new subscription service offerings in conjunction with new product offerings in continuous data protection and email security and to our installed base of customers in the form of renewals of existing contracts along with additional services

in process research and development year ended december  in thousands expenses percentage of total revenue year over year change in dollars year over year change in percent our methodology for allocating the purchase price for purchase acquisitions to in process research and development ipr d is determined through established valuation techniques and analysis  as applied in the high technology internet security industry 
the ipr d expense  which is from the mailfrontier acquisition  is primarily for the development of mailfrontier s version ipr d is expensed upon acquisition because 
table of contents technological feasibility has not been established and no future alternative uses exist 
total ipr d expense of million was charged to product development expenses on the date the assets were acquired 
the fair value of the existing purchased technology  as well as the technology under development  is determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rate used in the present value calculation was derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
we consider this pricing model for products related to this acquisition to be standard within the high technology internet security industry 
we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include significant anticipated cost savings 
the key assumptions underlying the valuation of our mailfrontier purchase acquisition for which in process research and development was recorded were as follows estimated cost to complete technology at time of acquisition of less than  and risk adjusted discount rate of 
other key assumptions include an expected completion date of less than one year and revenue and expense projections  assuming that the product has entered the market 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from this product will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisition was completed and may result in impairment charge 
actual results from the purchase acquisitions to date did not have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results

provision for income taxes 
year ended december  in thousands provision for income taxes percentage of income loss before taxes percentage of total revenue year over year change in dollars year over year change in percent our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal and state tax rates for the fiscal year ended december  due primarily to the effect of share based compensation related to incentive stock options  goodwill and intangible assets  which are permanent  non deductible book tax differences  and the utilization of million of the deferred tax assets derived from previously acquired companies 
the cumulative effect of these factors resulted in a reduction in goodwill 
we experienced a significant increase in our effective tax rate in  well above the statutory federal and state tax rates  primarily caused by following factors as of december   we had completely utilized the regular net operating losses that were generated by sonicwall  the remaining net operating losses consist of stock option and acquired net operating losses in tax free transactions and the share based compensation expense created permanent and or temporary differences 
at december   we continue to have a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based upon our determination that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets may not be realized in the foreseeable future given historical operating losses 
the net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryovers that comprise the vast majority of the deferred tax assets will expire at various dates through the year our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal and state tax rates for the fiscal year ended december  due primarily to the effect of amortization of stock based compensation  goodwill  and intangible assets  which are permanent  non deductible book tax differences  and the utilization of  of the deferred tax assets

liquidity and capital resource requirements we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the next twelve months

we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our sources of liquidity beyond twelve months  in management s opinion  will be our then current cash balances  funds from operations and whatever long term credit facilities we can arrange 
we have no other agreements or arrangements with third parties to provide us with sources of liquidity and capital resources beyond twelve months

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we classified our short term investments as available for sale 
consequently  investments are recorded on the balance sheet at the fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments included money markets securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds  and commercial paper which are subject to no interest rate risk when held to maturity  but may increase or decrease in value if interest rates change prior to maturity 

table of contents as stated in our investment policy  we are adverse to principal loss and further the goal of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the majority of our short term investments maturing in more than one year are readily tradable in to days 
due to this and the short duration of the balance of our investment portfolio  we believe an immediate change in interest rates would be immaterial to our financial condition or results of operations 
the following table presents the amounts of our short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  maturing in less than more than one year one year total in thousands  except percentage data short term investments weighted average interest rate foreign currency risk we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
we invoice substantially all of our foreign customers from the united states in us dollars and substantially all revenue is collected in us dollars 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from international markets  which in the future may be denominated in various currencies 
because our sales are denominated in us dollars  the weakness of a foreign country s currency against the dollar could increase the price of our products in such country and reduce our product unit sales by making our products more expensive in the local currency 
a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 
additionally  we have exposures to emerging market currencies  which can have extreme currency volatility 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of some currencies in relation to the us dollar and diverging economic conditions in foreign markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not affect adversely our financial results in the future 
in addition  we have minimal cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
