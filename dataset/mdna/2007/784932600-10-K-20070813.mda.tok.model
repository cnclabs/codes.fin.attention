table of contents introduction the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide readers with an understanding of saba 
the following are included in our md a overview  critical accounting policies  results of operations  and liquidity and capital resources 
overview general we help organizations manage their most important asset their people 
we provide the premier software platform for enterprise learning  collaboration  performance  and talent management  as well as license updates and product support  ondemand  implementation  training  and consulting services 
our people management solutions drive organizational excellence by bringing a disciplined approach to aligning  developing  and managing people across the entire organization 
by using saba to manage their extended workforce  our customers achieve demonstrably higher levels of performance through increased productivity  sales and service effectiveness reduced personnel development and training costs improved organizational agility and execution our solutions help our customers through the implementation of a management system for aligning goals  developing and motivating people and measuring results 
by implementing our solutions  organizations are better equipped to align their workforce around the organization s business objectives  effectively manage growing regulatory requirements  increase sales and channel readiness  accelerate the productivity of new people joining the extended enterprise of employees  customers  partners  and suppliers  increase both the speed of customer acquisition and long term customer loyalty  shorten time to market of new products  and improve visibility into organizational performance 
background we commenced operations in april and  through march  focused substantially all of our efforts on research activities  developing our products and building our business infrastructure 
we shipped our first saba enterprise learning products and began to generate revenues from software license fees  implementation and consulting services fees and support fees in april on may   we completed the acquisition of thinq learning solutions  inc thinq  a provider of enterprise learning management solutions which allowed us to expand our customer base and provided greater scale to increase our investment in research and development to accelerate innovation and increase stockholder value 
on january   we completed the acquisition of centra software  inc centra  a provider of online learning and training software and services 
we believe our acquisition of centra strengthened our competitive position in the human capital management market and provided us with a broader and deeper product offering 
in 
table of contents addition  as a result of the acquisition our customer base substantially increased 
the centra acquisition included total purchase consideration of million 
we have included the results of operations of centra in our consolidated financial statements beginning february  in connection with the acquisition of centra  we allocated  of the purchase price to in process research and development  or ipr d  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
we have expensed this amount in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended may  our corporate headquarters are located in redwood shores  california 
we have an international presence in india  france  japan  germany  the united kingdom  canada and australia through which we conduct various operating activities related to our business 
in each of the non us jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries  other than india  we have employees or consultants engaged in sales and services activities 
in the case of our india subsidiary  our employees primarily engage in software development and quality assurance testing activities 
sources of revenue we generate revenues from the sale of software licenses  ondemand services  annual license updates and product support  and professional services 
software licenses we license our software solutions in multi element arrangements that include a combination of our software  license updates and product support and or professional services 
a significant amount of our license sales are for perpetual licenses 
to date  a substantial majority of our software license revenue has been derived from the saba learning product suite 
going forward  we expect the saba enterprise suite and saba centra product suite to generate substantially all of our revenues 
our license revenue is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  as well as customers budgetary cycles and the competitive position of our software products 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is long  typically six to twelve months 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenue 
ondemand ondemand revenue includes revenue derived from term based managed application services 
these services are provided pursuant to customer agreements with terms typically ranging from one to three years 
the associated ondemand revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we believe that ondemand revenue will continue to grow as we anticipate that a substantial majority of our customers will renew their contracts on expiration and that we will continue to add new ondemand customers 
licenses updates and product support license updates and product support includes the right to receive future unspecified updates for the applicable software product and technical support 
we typically sell license updates and product support for an initial period of one year concurrently with the sale of the related software license 
after the initial period  license updates and product support is renewable on an annual basis at the option of the customer 
our license updates and product support revenue depends upon both our sales of additional software licenses and annual renewals of existing license updates and product support agreements 
we believe that license updates and product support revenue will continue to grow as we anticipate that a substantial majority of our customers will renew their annual contracts and the sale of new software licenses will increase the number of customers that purchase license updates and product support 
professional services our professional services business consists of consulting  education and strategic services 
consulting and education services are typically provided to customers that license software directly from us 
these consulting 
table of contents and education services are generally provided over a period of three to nine months after licensing the software 
generally  consulting services related to software implementation are not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
our consulting and education services revenue varies directly with the levels of license revenue generated from our direct sales organization in the preceding three to nine month period 
in addition  our consulting and education services revenue varies following our commercial release of significant software updates as our customers generally engage our services to assist with the implementation of their software update 
although we provide consulting services on a time and materials basis  a portion of these services is provided on a fixed fee basis 
strategic services are less dependent than consulting and education services on the sale of our licenses 
strategic services present additional opportunities that arise at different times throughout a customer life cycle 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue primarily consists of compensation  employee benefits and out of pocket travel related expenses for our employees  including our ondemand and license update and product support personnel  and the fees of third party subcontractors  who provide professional services to our clients 
additionally  costs of revenue also includes external hosting fees and depreciation and amortization charges on the necessary ondemand infrastructure  third party license royalty costs  and overhead allocated based on headcount and reimbursed expenses 
the amortization of acquired developed technology  comprised of the ratable amortization of technological assets acquired in the acquisition of centra software  inc in  is also included in the cost of revenue 
many factors affect our cost of revenue  including changes in the mix of products and services  pricing trends and changes in the amount of reimbursed expenses 
because cost as a percentage of revenues is higher for services than for software licenses  an increase in services  including ondemand services  as a percentage of our total revenue would reduce gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
operating expenses we classify all operating expenses  except amortization of purchased intangible assets and in process research and development  to the research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of the expenses 
each of these three categories includes commonly recurring expenses such as salaries including stock based compensation  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  and allocated communication  rent and depreciation costs 
we allocate communication  rent and depreciation costs to each of the functional areas that derive a benefit from such costs based upon their respective headcounts 
the sales and marketing category of operating expenses also includes sales commissions and expenses related to public relations and advertising  trade shows  and marketing collateral materials 
the general and administrative category of operating expenses also includes allowances for doubtful accounts and administrative and professional services fees 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs 
we have reviewed the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs with the audit committee 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize license revenues addressed below in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  as amended  we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
sop  as amended  requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we have analyzed each element in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to allocate revenues to certain ondemand offerings  license updates and product support and professional services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
license revenues from licenses with a term of three years or more are generally recognized on delivery if the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return and we do not recognize revenue from resellers until an end user has been identified and the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
license revenues from licenses with a term of less than three years are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
license updates and product support revenue is also recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically months 
revenue related to professional services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
although we provide professional services on a time and materials basis  a portion of these services is provided on a fixed fee basis 
for services performed on a fixed fee basis  revenues are generally recognized on the proportional performance of the project  with performance measured based on hours of work performed 
for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and services revenues are recognized over the service delivery period using the percentage of completion method 
revenue from our ondemand offerings is recognized as a service arrangement whereby the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement or on an as used basis if defined in the contract 
certain of our ondemand offerings are integrated offerings pursuant to which the customers ability to access our software is not separable from the services necessary to operate the software and customers are not allowed to take possession of our software  in which case revenue is recognized under the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
our ondemand offerings also include arrangements with customers that have separately licensed and taken possession of our software 
when these ondemand offerings are part of a multiple element arrangement involving licenses  we recognize revenue in accordance with sop allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and totaled million as of may  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which totaled  as of may   is based on our assessment of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on the aging of the accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other assumptions 
past due balances based on purchase order terms and other specific accounts as necessary are reviewed monthly 
account 
table of contents balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we account for goodwill and other intangibles under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill balance at may  was million  including million and million recorded as a result of our acquisitions of centra and thinq  respectively 
amortization of purchased intangible assets  including acquired developed technology  was million for fiscal million for fiscal and  for fiscal as of may   our purchased intangible assets balance was million 
sfas no 
prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we consider saba to be a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
we perform the required impairment analysis of goodwill annually or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate 
any reduction of enterprise fair value below the recorded amount of stockholders equity could require us to write down the value of and record an expense for an impairment loss 
restructuring costs 
the total accrued restructuring balance as of may  was  which was comprised of  for facilities related charges and  for workforce reduction charges 
 of the accrued restructuring charge was recorded as part of the purchase accounting in the centra acquisition 
the assumptions we have made are based on the current market conditions in the various areas where we have vacant space and necessarily entail a high level of management judgment 
market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to factors such as changes in property occupancy rates and rental prices charged for comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges for the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined and may be recorded as a credit to restructuring costs or a decrease of the purchase price 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined 
stock based compensation 
on june   we adopted sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  under the modified prospective method 
sfas r generally requires share based payments to employees to be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
prior to june   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
under apb  we generally did not recognize any compensation expense for stock options granted to employees or outside directors as the exercise price of our options was equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
for pro forma disclosures of stock based compensation prior to june   the estimated fair values for options granted and options assumed were amortized using the accelerated expense attribution method 
in addition  we reduced pro forma stock based compensation expense for actual forfeitures in the periods they occurred 
in march  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
we applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the impact of our adoption of statement r and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share based employee compensation 
upon our adoption of sfas r  we were required to estimate the awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the 
table of contents expense recognition period 
although we estimated forfeitures based on historical experience  forfeitures in the future may differ 
under statement r  the forfeiture rate must be revised if actual forfeitures differ from our original estimates 
also in connection with our adoption of statement r  we elected to recognize awards granted after our adoption date under the straight line amortization method 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes merton bsm pricing model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based upon our historical stock price volatility over the length of the expected term of the 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
beginning in  sfas r required the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax effected compensation that would have been recognized as if we had always accounted for our stock based award activity under sfas r to be reported as a cash flow from financing activities  rather than as a cash flow from operating activities  as was prescribed under accounting rules applicable through may  as we do not expect to realize any of these benefits  due to operating losses  no such amounts have been recorded through may  the accounting guidance under sfas r is relatively new and several interpretations have been released since the pronouncement has been issued 
additional interpretations may be released and the application of these principles may be subject to further refinement over time 
in addition  to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs and refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded during our fiscal reporting periods 
results of operations years ended may   and on january   we completed the acquisition of centra software  inc and have included centra s results of operations from the date of acquisition in our condensed consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our results of operations and the related discussions include centra s operating results for the full year ended may  and for four months of the year ended may   and do not include centra s operating results for any portion of the year ended may  accordingly  the acquisition had a significant impact on our fiscal over fiscal growth rates 
our acquisition of centra did not result in any new reportable segments

we recorded income tax expense of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal income tax expense has consisted primarily of foreign income tax expense incurred as a result of local country profits 
the tax return of one of our subsidiaries is currently under examination 
we have concluded that it is probable that the examination will result in an additional liability 
we believe that adequate tax provisions have been provided for the likely outcome of the ongoing examination 
we will continually review our estimates related to our income tax obligations  including potential assessments of additional taxes  penalties and or 
table of contents interest  and revise our estimates  if deemed necessary 
a revision in our estimates of our tax obligations will be reflected as an adjustment to our income tax provision at the time of the change in our estimates 
such a revision could materially impact our income tax provision and results of operations 
the tax return of another of our subsidiaries was under examination as of may  during june  we settled with the tax authorities agreeing to pay approximately  to settle all outstanding claims 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets  as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth condensed consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended may  this information has been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of management  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read this information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
except for one quarter  we have incurred net losses on a gaap basis in each quarter since inception 
you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter  as quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full fiscal year or any other period

table of contents our results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if revenues fall below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall and operating losses will increase 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience long sales cycles 
therefore  the timing of future customer contracts could be difficult to predict  making it difficult to estimate revenues between quarters 
we are subject to employer payroll taxes  both domestic and foreign  on employee exercises of non qualified stock options 
these taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees  measured by the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
we receive domestic tax deductions for gains realized by domestic employees on the exercise of non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recorded as additional paid in capital when realized

however  we may be required  or could choose  to raise additional funds at any time 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our future revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing and general and administrative activities  the success of our existing and new product and service offerings and competing technological and market developments

table of contents foreign currency risk we do not use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are primarily made in us dollars  and to a lesser but increasing extent  british pounds and euros  however  as we continue to expand our operations  more of our contracts may be denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars and japanese yen 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises in part from inter company accounts with our foreign subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary  and  when re measured and translated in us dollars  have an impact on our operating results depending upon the movement in foreign currency rates 
during fiscal  our total realized and unrealized losses due to movements in foreign currencies  primarily british pounds  european union euros and indian rupees  was  as exchange rates vary  these foreign exchange results may vary and adversely or favorably impact operating results 
an unfavorable change of in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements
