part i item business overview caliper life sciences  inc sells products  services and integrated systems comprised of instruments  software and reagents to life sciences  biomedical and pharmaceutical researchers 
we believe our offerings enable our customers to accelerate drug discovery  enhance the diagnosis of disease and facilitate scientific research 
caliper s strategy is to transform drug discovery and development through technologies and services that are relevant to and predictive of drug effects in humans 
our products and services  assembled from our leading portfolio of microfluidics  automation  liquid handling  and molecular imaging technologies  address key issues along the critical path of pre clinical drug discovery and development 
on august   we completed our acquisition of xenogen corporation 
xenogen develops and markets products  technologies and services for acquiring  analyzing and managing complex image data from live animals 
our acquisition of xenogen provides us entry into the fast growing molecular imaging market  and positions us as one of the first life science instrumentation companies able to provide an integrated portfolio of products and services for both in vitro referring to tests or reactions taking place outside a living organism and in vivo referring to tests or reactions taking place inside a living organism research 
a large majority of drug candidates that seem promising in early in vitro studies fail during pre clinical animal trials 
by tracking this drug attrition  understanding its root causes  and pursuing solutions  we believe we can improve the clinical relevance of early drug discovery and development 
the initial focus of our strategic effort has been to pursue oncology applications  and we are currently seeking new experimental models  techniques and tools that bridge in vitro and in vivo experimentation in this major therapeutic area 
future areas of interest include solutions for cardiovascular  metabolic disease and inflammation immunology therapeutic programs 
our products and services currently address some of the key challenges that face the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  including shrinking drug candidate pipelines  late stage drug failures  and unforeseen side effects coming to light late in the development process  or post commercialization 
using our products and services  researchers are able to increase the speed and efficiency of their screening efforts  make better choices earlier in the drug discovery and development process  and conduct profiling experiments that identify drug side effects well before the human clinical trial stage 
we are pursuing the application of our technology to the diagnostics market and believe that our labchip technologies may be able to provide ease of use  cost and data quality benefits for certain diagnostic tests 
these benefits are the anticipated result of chip based integration  automation and miniaturization of the various workflow steps required to perform these tests 
we are presently working with collaboration partners in this area through our caliper driven program 
although most of these projects are still in the feasibility or early development stages  we believe that one of our caliper driven partners  agilent technologies  expects to commercialize its first diagnostic test based on our labchip technology in caliper was organized under the laws of the state of delaware on july  our principal executive offices are located at elm street  hopkinton  massachusetts  and our telephone number is our web site address is www

market opportunity our worldwide market consists of pharmaceutical  biotechnology and other companies engaged in biopharmaceutical research  and not for profit institutions engaged in biomedical research 
in the united states alone  there are over one thousand biotechnology companies  along with a smaller number of pharmaceutical companies 
although the pharmaceutical companies are fewer in number  they are typically much larger in terms of resources  size and capitalization 
in addition to the foregoing  the united states alone has over academic and not for profit institutions engaged in biomedical research 
as highlighted in the fda critical path initiative  biomarker research and better experimentation models are essential to improve predictability and efficiency along the critical path from laboratory to commercial drug 
we believe that the combination of our proprietary microfluidic and imaging technologies along with our automation expertise addresses these key research needs by creating molecular level solutions that encompass both in vitro and in vivo experimentation 
these technologies offer exceptional data quality and productivity advantages  and we believe that combining them to offer a highly correlated suite of products and services should result in earlier  clinically relevant insights in the drug discovery process 
we refer to the continuum of these solutions as the i i bridge  which stands for in vitro to in vivo testing bridge 
caliper s broad range of products and services are designed to enable biopharmaceutical companies to reduce costs and standardize analytical techniques across four key areas of the pre clinical drug discovery and development chain biological screening  pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics  absorption  distribution  metabolism  excretion and toxicology adme tox  and drug dosage and formulation testing 
our strategy is to provide tools and services that are relevant to and ultimately predictive of clinical results 
we believe we are one of the first life science instrumentation companies able to provide an integrated package of products and services that span both in vitro and in vivo pre clinical research 
our in vitro technologies support a wide range of applications  such as biochemical  gene  protein and cellular assays in order to assess the status of a given biological parameter at a point in time 
our high quality in vitro models are designed to allow researchers to integrate and automate experiments to achieve improved data accuracy and reproducibility at a reduced cost and higher speed  leading to expanded individual researcher capability and improved enterprise wide productivity 
our in vivo technologies allow researchers to validate a hypothesis concerning the effects of a drug on  or the role of a gene or protein in  a biological system by testing the hypothesis in animal models 
in vivo technologies have evolved over time from conventional animal models  to genetically modified animals in which specific genes are altered  and more recently to transgenic animals in which a foreign gene of interest has been inserted  deleted or replaced 
through the use of our in vivo imaging systems  researchers can follow the spread of a disease  or the effects of a drug  in the same animal over time in order to better predict human response 
the graphic below depicts the span of caliper s integrated solutions across the phases of pre clinical drug discovery graphic technologies microfluidics our labchip microfluidic solutions provide significant advances in laboratory experimentation for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
microfluidic chips are the key components of our labchip systems  which also include a labchip instrument and experiment specific reagents and software 
our chips contain a network of miniaturized  microfabricated channels through which fluids and chemicals are moved to perform experiments 
a single type of chip  used with customized reagents and software to perform a particular experiment  comprises one labchip application 
depending on the chip format  reagents are introduced either automatically or by the user 
the instrument and related software control the movement of fluids through the chip via pressure or voltage  and an integrated optical system detects the results of the particular experiment 
because we have great flexibility in channel design  and can exert split second computer control over fluid flow  we have the ability to create chips for numerous applications 
our labchip systems miniaturize  integrate and automate experiments and are designed to provide improved data accuracy and reproducibility  reduced cost and higher speed  leading to expanded individual researcher capability and improved enterprise wide productivity 
features of labchip systems miniaturization 
a conventional laboratory typically uses at least a drop of fluid  or to microliters  to perform each experiment 
in many applications using our labchip systems  the sample volume needed from external sources is reduced to below nanoliter  a reduction of up to  fold over conventional systems 
in some processes within the chip  reagents are dispensed in the microchannels in volumes down to tens of picoliters  another to fold reduction  which speeds analysis times and increases sample throughput 
a microliter is one millionth of a liter  a nanoliter is one billionth of a liter  and a picoliter is one trillionth of a liter 
integration 
integration involves combining multiple processes into a single process  or the inclusion of multiple functions into one device 
today many laboratory systems perform only one or two steps of an experimental protocol 
our labchip systems can integrate complete experiments involving half a dozen or more steps into one continuous process performed on a single chip 
automation 
many laboratory experiments are performed in multiple manual steps 
with our labchip systems  entire experiments can be automated and performed inside a chip using one instrument  freeing up valuable research time and laboratory space and reducing labor requirements 
key benefits of labchip systems improved data quality and accuracy 
our labchip systems are designed to produce more accurate  consistent and reproducible data by reducing human error through increased automation  reducing the variability caused by the use of multiple instruments through integration of an application on a single system  and enabling more analytical approaches to experimentation that are impractical in traditional systems 
for example  biochemical screening assays typically call for fast  bulk measurements of an experimental mixture 
reducing the volume size of the experiment allows for rapid separation and measurement of individual molecular species in the test mixture  which in turn enhances the accuracy of the overall result 
with higher quality data  our customers can make better decisions earlier in the drug discovery and development process 
this enables our customers to avoid the time and expense of performing additional analyses and experiments on false positive results from their primary screening experiments 
improved sensitivity 
when screening against drug targets  such as kinases  the higher quality data from our labchip systems allows customers to detect more subtle drug compound activities than can be detected with traditional microplate well based assays 
this has two advantages an increase in the pool of potential lead compounds  and the possibility that a hit found at lower levels of inhibition will be more selective for the target of interest than a hit found at higher levels of inhibition because compounds that hit at higher levels of inhibition may also produce unacceptable levels of inhibition on other  non target kinases 
reduced reagent and labor cost 
our labchip systems utilize only a small fraction of the usual amount of expensive reagents used in experiments performed in test tubes  well plates  or well plates  and reduce the labor involved in each experiment 
we believe that saving on reagent and labor costs will enable pharmaceutical companies to expand the scale of experimentation in ways that would otherwise not be commercially feasible 
high speed 
we believe our labchip systems can  depending on the application  accelerate some experiments as much as fold or more 
for example  molecular separations such as electrophoresis may take two hours or more using conventional equipment 
using a chip  however  these separations can be performed in less than one minute 
faster assay development 
traditional assays  particularly those used for enzymatic screening  can require complex and time consuming assay development 
for example  some popular assays rely on developing specific antibodies for the assay a process that can take up to six weeks or more 
because our labchip assays eliminate the requirement for assay development steps such as antibody preparation  they are much faster to develop 
in addition  we have exploited the predictable nature of fluid and reagent movement inside microfluidic channels and have developed software tools to facilitate the process of optimizing the experimental conditions necessary for a successful enzymatic assay on a labchip device  such as separating a substrate peptide from its product 
typically  our customers have found that these combined benefits shorten a two to three month assay development process for a traditional assay to just a week or two for a labchip assay 
expanded individual researcher capability 
because our labchip systems can combine a multi step  complex experiment into one step  we believe that individual researchers can perform experiments previously outside their areas of expertise 
by comparison  with conventional  non integrated equipment  researchers need to master the complexities of performing each individual step 
improved enterprise wide productivity 
we believe that our labchip systems improve data quality and reproducibility so much that researchers will be able to utilize data generated outside their laboratory or organization if such data was generated on a labchip system 
this has the potential to greatly improve enterprise wide productivity by supporting data sharing and reducing the need to repeat experiments 
for example  a typical primary screen produces approximate  yes no answers about the activity of library compounds against a particular kinase target  and therefore the information from such primary screens is only useful for one primary screening experiment 
with labchip assays  the primary screening data is more specific in terms of the degree of inhibition  and more reproducible 
this could enable an organization to build a database of primary screening data that could ultimately be mined by other scientists within the organization interested in a particular compound target interaction 
imaging our optical imaging solutions allow researchers to observe disease and molecular mechanisms in living  intact organisms in a non invasive manner 
this process is generally referred to as molecular imaging 
our products and services allow researchers to focus on those stages of disease progression within animal models that are most predictive of human response 
with this information  researchers can follow the spread of a disease  or the effects of a drug  in the same animal over time 
the real time capabilities of biophotonic imaging enable visual observation of mechanisms of action or cascading events within the animal that would not otherwise be detected using conventional animal models 
this capability is particularly important in studies in which genes are altered by environmental determinants and in studies in which drugs are delivered and affect biological pathways of whole tissues in a manner that cellular systems or other in vitro systems do not 
we believe the combination of genetically modified animals and biophotonic imaging has created more reliable animal models 
transgenic animal models developed for biophotonic imaging are disease specific and enable analysis of gene expression  protein activity and disease progression 
in our genetically modified animals  known as lpta animal models  the gene for luciferase is inserted behind the promoter of a particular gene of interest 
relative levels of transcription of the gene of interest can then be monitored directly by light emission 
in addition to genetically modified animals  we have modified cells and microorganisms alone to express the luciferase gene  known as bioware products  for tracking and monitoring these cells within an unmodified laboratory animal 
increasing the throughput of in vivo animal testing and utilizing it earlier in the drug development cycle may substantially reduce the costs of drug development and improve the time to market of successful drug candidates by identifying drug candidate failures earlier in the development process 
we believe that implementation of our molecular imaging technology will allow consolidation and acceleration of the target validation  lead optimization and preclinical stages of the drug development process 
likewise  efficacy and toxicity tests can be performed earlier in the drug development cycle to avoid late stage failures 
for example  the pictures below demonstrate  at left  the biophotonic image of a tumor growing in a live animal over time and  at right  the quantitative measurement of the relative tumor size as time progresses 
this example uses one of our bioware tumor cell lines that has been genetically modified to express the luciferase gene  and ultimately  light  in an ordinary mouse and is imaged using our specially designed camera system  known as the ivis imaging system 
graphic graphic additionally  through our xenogen biosciences corporation subsidiary  we offer to biopharmaceutical companies and biomedical researchers animal production and phenotyping services to create both traditional and bioluminescent transgenic animal models to test the effects of a drug on  or the role of a gene or protein in these relevant model systems 
whereas previously  biopharmaceutical companies tended to perform all research and development in house  there is a trend in recent years to focus in house r d departments on core competencies  and to outsource specific technologies and products to specialized service providers and vendors 
as a consequence  a large industry segment has formed in recent years to deliver various specialized technologies and services to biopharmaceutical companies 
over the past years  xenogen biosciences has offered many of these specialized technologies  including the creation and phenotypic characterization of transgenic and gene knockout animals  in vivo evaluation of compounds at various stages of development  and utilization of biophotonic imaging to perform biodistribution  drug delivery and or biochemical studies 
specifically  the technology most relied upon for target validation within the pharmaceutical industry today is gene knockout technology in concert with comprehensive phenotypic analysis 
genetically engineered mice can be highly informative in the discovery of gene function and pharmaceutical utility of a potential drug target  as well as in the determination of the potential on target side effects associated with a given target 
aside from whether a gene is a good drug target  genetically engineered animals also provide invaluable models to assess the pharmacology  and increasingly the toxicology  of drug candidates  making them well accepted validation models 
xenogen biosciences experience includes creating and characterizing these types of animal models  creating transgenic animal models  and producing thousands of unique genetically modified lines for academic  government and commercial customers

products and services the following discussion summarizes caliper s products and services portfolio as of december  microfluidics systems labchip drug discovery system 
using proprietary sipper chips to automatically sample library compounds from or well plates  the labchip performs unattended  high volume screening  producing high quality data that minimizes false positives and false negatives and detects weak inhibitors with high accuracy  potentially identifying drug candidates that conventional techniques can miss 
each chip has either or sippers  small glass capillary tubes attached to the chip 
once the researcher prepares the chip and places it into a labchip system  minute quantities of sample can be introduced  or sipped  through the capillary tube onto the chip 
this sipping process can be repeated many times with different compounds  enabling a single chip to analyze thousands of samples quickly and without human intervention 
assays are available for the labchip system for enzymatic drug targets such as kinases  proteases  phosphatases  and lipid modifying enzymes  and cell based targets such as g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs 
new system capabilities allow screening against both adherent and non adherent cell types  and the small volumes of cells required enable screening against cells that are in short supply  for example primary cells 
our labchip system is a fast  cost effective way to generate numerous assays to meet the evolving requirements of pharmaceutical companies specific profiling strategies 
desktop profiler kinase profiling system 
the desktop profiler instrument  which was introduced during  with profilerpro reagent kits  provides a convenient  affordable approach to kinase profiling  helping researchers determine the interaction between drug candidates and the many different kinases found in the human body 
kinases are an important class of drug discovery targets since they have been shown to play a role in cancer  and cardiovascular disease  as well as other diseases 
a typical kinase drug development program will focus on finding lead compounds that inhibit a particular kinase thought to play a role in the disease being studied 
as scientists learn more about the human kinome  the collective term for the different kinases found in the human body  they also are becoming increasingly concerned about the interactions of lead compounds on non target kinases  and the potential adverse side effects resulting from these interactions 
as a result  selectivity or profiling screens  where lead compounds are screened against a representative group of human kinases  are increasingly becoming a routine part of drug discovery programs 
our profilerpro kinase panel plate kits consist of a representative kinases that are pre dispensed into a pair of well microplates 
this diverse set of kinases spans the human kinome  and is highly relevant in a variety of therapeutic research areas including oncology  the central nervous system  cardiovascular disease  inflammation and diabetes

affymetrix markets and distributes the co branded gcas system  which was introduced in we serve as the oem supplier of these systems and partner with affymetrix to provide installation  training and field service for these new automated systems 
the complete system includes automation instrumentation  affymetrix s genechip microarrays  optimized assays and reagents  and open software architecture 
agilent technologies 
in june  we entered into a new five year supply agreement to be the exclusive supplier of planar chips to agilent for both research and diagnostic applications 
the planar chips  based on our microfluidic labchip technologies  are utilized on the agilent bioanalyzer which agilent first introduced in september the agilent bioanalyzer is a desktop instrument designed to perform a menu of analyses including dna  rna  protein and cell assays  based on the particular chip utilized 
we believe that agilent is planning to commercialize its first diagnostic test based on the bioanalyzer platform in bio rad laboratories 
in the fall of  bio rad launched the experion automated electrophoresis system as a product of a multi year product development and commercialization agreement we entered into with bio rad in june bio rad is a long established leader in gel electrophoresis separations  particularly protein separations  and the experion product represents its first microfluidics based product for this market 
under the terms of the agreement  we receive royalties on all future sales of co developed instruments  and we are the exclusive manufacturer of labchip devices for use with co developed instrument platforms  such as the experion 
the experion system provides rapid  reproducible analysis of protein and rna samples 
in  we extended bio rad s license rights to include the analysis of dna samples 
in september  we entered into a second collaboration agreement with bio rad under which the companies will study the feasibility of developing a new microfluidics platform 
the details of the platform have not been disclosed 
marketing agreements 
through our acquisition of xenogen  we assumed a long term agreement with taconic farms  one of the largest providers of laboratory animals in the world  for joint marketing and distribution of certain transgenic animals with a single luminescence reporter gene compatible with our ivis imaging technology 
taconic may sell those animals only to licensees of our imaging patents and under limited use agreements 
we granted taconic the right to breed  distribute and sell certain lpta animal models to its customers and we share in profits received from their sale 
customers our current customers include many of the world s leading biomedical and pharmaceutical companies as well as oem providers of complementary life science solutions 
approximately   and of our total revenues for   and  respectively  were derived from customers in the united states 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for revenues from customers and long lived assets attributable to geographic areas outside of the united states 
during  no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenue 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information on concentration of our revenues 
we have typically experienced higher revenues in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the capital spending patterns of our customers although this trend may be affected prospectively as a result of the acquisition of xenogen 
historically  xenogen s revenue was subject to seasonal variations as a result of customer budget cycles 
for example  in the biomedical research community  grant proposals are due in october  february and june with funds delivered the following june  october and march  respectively 
due to the grant cycle  xenogen historically achieved higher revenues in the second and fourth quarters 
backlog for a portion of our sales  we manufacture products based on our forecast of customer demand and maintain inventories in advance of receipt of purchase orders 
our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of orders received in that quarter for shipment in the same quarter  shipments from our backlog of orders from previous quarters  and recognition of revenues that had been previously recorded as deferred revenue pursuant to our revenue recognition policy 
our products are typically shipped within ninety days of purchase order receipt 
as a result  we do not believe that the amount of backlog at any particular date is indicative of our future level of sales in any succeeding quarter 
the level of backlog at december  was million 
in our backlog  we include only the total value of open purchase orders for products and services that management has concluded have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve month period 
this amount specifically excludes deferred revenue  and products and services to be provided in the future pursuant to terms of contractual agreements for which we have not yet received purchase orders 
our backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not include all product sales needed to achieve expected revenues for that quarter 
consequently  we are dependent on obtaining orders for products to be shipped in the same quarter that the order is received 
moreover  customers may reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
accordingly  we have limited visibility into future product shipments  and our results of operations are subject to variability from quarter to quarter 
research and development research and development infrastructure we employ personnel with legal and scientific expertise as part of our in licensing and out licensing programs 
we also have biological scientists that work together with our electromechanical engineers  physicists and tissue optics experts to create scientific applications in oncology  inflammation  and drug metabolism  cardiovascular disease  metabolic disease and toxicology 
we also employ a technical applications group to interact at the scientific level with our customers  in order to understand our customers technological needs  both for future product development purposes and to help our customers understand new applications that we have developed 
technology research today we have ongoing core technology research and applied product development efforts in several areas chip design 
we are investigating the development of new microfluidic chips using a variety of materials including glass  quartz  and plastics 
using the principles of physics and engineering  we create patterns of interconnected channels that permit execution of the various common steps of experimentation 
designs from one chip can be used for other chips needing similar fluidic functions for a different application 
analytical and computer simulation models are employed to minimize the number of iterations necessary to achieve new functional chip designs 
these modeling capabilities are also essential for optimizing assay conditions for specific analytes and reagents  on chip thermal control  and determining quality control parameters for production chips 
we have made substantial investments in lab on a chip research since our inception  and believe that we have established a leading position in lab on a chip technology 
chip manufacturing 
we continue to seek ways to improve the yield and decrease the cost of manufacturing our chips 
we are exploring novel fabrication techniques and the use of new materials that offer functional advantages  such as superior optical features or lower manufacturing costs 
we have development programs exploring manufacturing technology for chips made of plastic 
plastic devices potentially offer cost advantages and can offer favorable surface chemistry or design features for some applications 
one area of continuous improvement is micromachining technology for precisely attaching capillaries to our sipper chips 
in automated experimentation  the number of these capillaries governs the level of throughput 
accordingly  we have developed high yield fabrication methods to enable us to cost effectively manufacture chips with many capillaries 
another important area of development is surface chemistry in particular  controlling the reproducibility of channel surface characteristics in our labchip products 
imaging instrumentation and software 
our physics research and development department  in conjunction with our biology product planning group  is responsible for new imaging product and application development 
new product concepts for instrumentation are evaluated by our physics research and development department  and those chosen are taken from concept through the pre production prototype stage 
this department also works closely with our manufacturing operations to transition the pre production prototype to full production  provides initial user support and any required design modifications  and develops and provides initial support for new applications of our instrumentation until such applications are sufficiently developed for transition to our instrument manufacturing group 
reagents and bioware products 
our biology product planning group is responsible for identifying new animal models to be developed that will provide particularly high value to our customers 
our biology product planning group produces these validated new applications comprising animal models and cell lines from three different sources we in license and perform quality control on reagents that have already been made by others for conventional methodologies that complement our noninvasive imaging methodology  we build and validate proprietary cell lines and models in our research laboratories  and we in license rights to cell lines and animal models made by certain of our customers who have used our technology to create animal models 
through these strategies  we are able to leverage the research and development expenditures of third parties to further our sales and the adoption of our technology 
liquid handling and automation instrument manufacturing and software design 
our skilled electrical engineers  optical engineers  mechanical engineers  product designers and software engineers create new liquid handling and automation instruments and software that are designed to optimize liquid handling and automation of life science laboratory applications  or to control fluid movement  temperature control  and detection functionality for our microfluidic chips 
software engineers write computer programs to manage tasks such as controlling chip functionality  collecting data  communicating between different instrument modules and communicating between caliper s and other manufacturer s instruments 
systems and assay integration 
when developing commercial products  we seek to incorporate functionalities that are necessary to perform a specific experiment  and configure the assay so that it offers tangible benefits to users as compared to existing  traditional technologies 
by carefully characterizing the problems and existing bottlenecks in an end user s workflow  as well as the solution  we are able to define precise product specifications to meet customer needs 
the resulting complete solution often includes a labchip device  liquid handling to manage bulk reagent needs of the chip  instrumentation to control flow and temperature  robotics for automating the handling of sample plates and detection optics  computer software for instrument control and data analysis  and reagents 
our recent development efforts have focused on continuing to increase functional integration on chip  including sample purification  reaction reagent assembly  reaction incubation sometimes with temperature cycling  post reaction separation  and detection 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december    and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and development spending to decrease in the future to the extent that our revenues grow  and as we slow the pace of discretionary spending on research programs by focusing on those opportunities with maximum commercial viability and sharing the funding of r d programs with partners 
in  r d funded by customers and government grants  which we include in our contract revenues  was approximately of our research and development expense 
this percentage could vary significantly in a given year based on our ability to obtain customer funding and on the nature of the development projects chosen for a particular year 
nonetheless  we believe that this shared investment risk model is important  not only because it offsets at least a portion of our r d expense  but also because it provides important customer validation regarding the potential commercial value of a particular r d project 
through these measures  we have been able to reduce our research and development expenses in recent years  and utilize our resources more efficiently 
manufacturing and supply all of our instrument manufacturing is performed in our hopkinton  massachusetts manufacturing facility  which is iso compliant 
the international standards organization  or iso  sets international standards for quality in product design  manufacturing and distribution 
we manufacture some subassemblies ourselves  and other components are made to our specifications by outside vendors 
to ensure the quality and on time delivery of parts and subassemblies  we track our top suppliers and score them on a monthly basis 
the subassemblies are inspected and tested before being placed into final product assemblies 
production cycle times range from several hours to five days for more complex workstations 
systems and workstations are produced from components based on a wide variety of proprietary technologies  including intricate mechanical actuators  precision fluid handling systems  computers and software 
we produce systems by combining certain of our products with third party vendor equipment  primarily detection instrumentation 
the systems are a combination of standard components  assembled in either standard or custom configurations to meet a customer s specific needs 
a typical production cycle ranges from to days from receipt of an order to shipment of a system 
the final products are then put through an extensive testing cycle before being released for shipment 
testing at our factory and or the customer s site establishes that the system is performing to the customer s specifications 
we manufacture all of our chips in a class clean room facility in mountain view  california 
caliper is iso compliant for the development  manufacture and distribution of our chips and reagents 
we contract with third parties to supply raw materials  component parts and sub assemblies used in our chips and reagents kits 
we intend to continue to invest in our infrastructure for the manufacture and distribution of our chips while reviewing outsourcing options for manufacturing at a lower cost 
for a discussion of the methods we use to manufacture our chips see the sections above titled technologies  products and services and research and development 
in august  following our acquisition of xenogen  our hopkinton manufacturing facility took over the engineering design  prototyping  assembly  quality assurance  installation and service for all ivis imaging systems 
we use oem providers for various parts of the imaging systems including the cameras  boxes  certain subassemblies  filters and lenses 
we rely on two primary camera vendors  andor technology  ltd 
and spectral instruments  inc  to provide cameras for all of our ivis imaging systems 
under the andor supply agreement  andor manufactures and sells to xenogen a ccd camera and related equipment for use with the ivis imaging system lumina series 
under the spectral instruments supply agreement  spectral manufactures and sells to us a ccd camera for our other imaging systems 
that agreement was amended in april and automatically renews each october for an additional month period unless explicitly terminated by either party six months prior to the expiration date or unless there is an uncured breach  bankruptcy or insolvency of either party 
we obtain key components of our chips  instruments and reagent based products from a number of suppliers  including  in certain cases  single source or limited source suppliers 
for instance  we receive proprietary dyes  which are used in many of our labchip products  from a single source 
furthermore  we depend on a foreign single source supplier for the glass used in the manufacture of certain types of our chips 
however  the majority of key components for our chips and instruments are available on a short lead time from our suppliers 
the only component requiring any significant lead time to acquire is our glass stock  as our supplier requires a minimum order to cover an entire production run 
we anticipate that current inventories of this material  at current production levels  will be sufficient for the next months 
although we have established licensing arrangements and supply agreements with most of our suppliers  there can be no assurances that these companies could not in some way be adversely affected in the future  and be unable to meet our critical supply needs 
if the supply of components from these suppliers were interrupted  we might not be able to manufacture our products at all or in a timely fashion  which would disrupt our delivery of products to our customers 
we believe our current manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet current and anticipated demand through animal production we maintain separate animal vivaria to prevent the spread of disease  which could cause a loss of valuable strains of animals 
our xenogen biosciences operation in cranbury  new jersey  houses our animal production facility including a large barrier animal vivarium that is accredited by the association for the assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care  or aaalac  and has an assurance of compliance with olaw office of lab animal welfare 
in this specific pathogen free spf facility  we perform genetically modified animal production  characterization of genetically modified animals phenotyping  and in vivo compound profiling 
we ship animals to our clients and provide in vivo research capabilities to our customers from this facility 
we have scientists and animal resources personnel specially trained in animal care  handling  and science who provide services to our customers and are available to collaborate with other divisions of caliper life sciences 
proprietary animal strains that are distributed non exclusively are shipped from the cranbury facility 
in addition  some of the strains most widely used by our customers are also housed and distributed by one of two outside vendors  charles river laboratories or taconic 
our alameda  california facility has one vivarium and a separate animal imaging suite 
we perform breeding and model validation in this facility  which has an animal resources program with personnel specially trained in animal care and handling 
in  one of the animal facilities in alameda was contaminated by a mouse virus introduced through one of xenogen s animal vendors 
that facility was closed for decontamination  and xenogen transferred its most valuable strains to third party breeders for rederivation so that xenogen could continue to provide animals to our customers 
the decontamination process took approximately three months 
xenogen has moved all of these operations to a new barrier facility to reduce the contamination risk 
similar contamination occurred again in neither event represented a loss of revenue  but did affect xenogen s operational costs by increasing its animal support costs 
each facility has individual environmental controls  as well as a veterinary consultant to assist us in monitoring the health of our animal population 
reagents and bioware we maintain laboratory space in our alameda facility to create and maintain stocks of microorganism and cell line reagents 
we have an exclusive supply agreement with biosynth international  inc for the supply of luciferin  a chemical compound that is introduced into cells and organisms in order to produce bioluminescence  and which we  and our customers  use with our bioware products and lpta animal models 
luciferin is stored and shipped out of our mountain view  california facility 
vivofluor fluorescent labeling kits for in vivo imaging  which are custom developed for us by invitrogen  are also stored and shipped out of our mountain view facility 
competition in general  markets for instruments  animal models and reagents and services collectively life science tools and services designed for life sciences applications are very competitive  and we believe these markets will remain competitive in the future 
the competition we face in these markets arises from other companies selling life science tools and services that are directly competitive with us  and from companies selling other types of life science tools and services who are competing for the same  scarce funds in a potential customer s capital budget 
although we believe that we have significant intellectual property protection to prevent others from developing competing integrated products  there are other manufacturers of similar individual technologies 
automation and liquid handling systems 
there are many companies providing competitive liquid handling products  automation products and integration services for applications such as high throughput screening  adme  active pharmaceutical ingredient api and dosage form development and quality assurance 
we believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are productivity enhancement  breadth of applications  accuracy  ease of use  price  performance  product reliability and service support 
direct and indirect competition for these types of products and services comes from many companies  including beckman coulter  biotek instruments  cybio  hamilton  innovodyne  gilson  labcyte  molecular devices  perkinelmer  protodyne  tecan  thermo electron  velocity  symix and sotax 
in vitro compound profiling services 
we compete with other companies that provide in vitro assay development  screening and profiling services to drug discovery and development laboratories 
we believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are cost per compound tested  data quality  innovation  and turn around time 
competition for these types of services comes from many companies  including cerep  mds pharma  millipore  invitrogen  and carna biosciences 
labchip drug discovery 
we compete with established alternative technologies for enzymatic assays such as promega  invitrogen  millipore and cisbio as well as companies developing their own microfluidics or lab on a chip technologies and products  such as fluidigm  gyros  micronics  biotrove  microfluidic systems  nanostream  m  applied biosystems and cepheid 
microfluidic technologies have undergone and are expected to continue to undergo rapid and significant change 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in these and future technologies  which we may not be able to do 
rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete 
products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies 
labchip electrophoresis separations 
we compete with companies that supply both traditional gel technologies  and more contemporary microfluidic technologies  for gel electrophoretic separations for proteins  dna and rna 
we believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are cost per sample analyzed  throughput and productivity enhancement  data quality  ease of use and service support 
competition for these types of products and services comes from many companies  including agilent  bio rad laboratories  beckman coulter  and invitrogen 
in markets where we sell products based on our labchip technology  we not only need to demonstrate the advantages of our products over competing technologies and products  but we must also often overcome a customer s resistance to switching from a well established  traditional technology to a fundamentally new technology 
under the surviving terms of our original collaboration agreement with agilent  agilent has a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to certain of our labchip technologies 
under the terms of this license  agilent is able to develop  make and sell certain labchip devices in the field of our collaboration  although we are their exclusive provider of planar chips 
imaging 
we compete with conventional molecular imaging technologies  including clinical imaging modalities such as pet  mri  x ray  ct and spect  which utilize the penetrating radiation of positrons  radio waves  x rays and gamma rays 
most of these technologies require operation by a highly trained technician 
in addition  some are limited by the need for radioactivity and concomitant shielding  storage and disposal issues 
other of these technologies image anatomy  rather than molecular events 
by comparison  our in vivo bioluminescent and fluorescent imaging technique involves an optical imaging approach that does not require the use of specially trained technicians or radioactive substances 
compared to these other imaging technologies in which one animal is imaged over time  our instruments and imaging methodology allows for relatively high throughput animal imaging and data collection 
our primary competition in the in vivo imaging market is from traditional in vivo animal models 
while numerous technologies for animal analyses exist  we believe we are the only company to offer an integrated system of equipment  software and reagents for the biophotonic imaging of animals 
still  while we believe that our integrated system of instruments and equipment  software and reagents improve the productivity and efficiency of drug discovery and development  the up front costs and licensing fees associated with the use of our systems make their use generally more expensive than conventional technologies for in vivo testing 
light producing animal models 
there are more than light producing animal models currently used in conventional applications  many of which can be used in our ivis imaging systems 
producers of these models  generally biomedical researchers at not for profit institutions  would potentially require one or more licenses from us and third parties to commercialize these models for biophotonic imaging 
consequently  these models comprise a sizable pool of potential in licensing candidates for us 
biophotonic cameras 
several companies sell highly sensitive cameras capable of biophotonic imaging  including eastman kodak company  berthold detection systems gmbh  hamamatsu photonics  visen  kk  olympus corporation  roper scientific  inc  and biospace  in addition to several privately held companies 
while these cameras have similar features and imaging capabilities to our ivis imaging systems  none of those companies have the right to sell their cameras for applications claimed by our patents 
light producing reagents 
we compete with large companies who develop light producing reagents used in animal models such as ge healthcare discovery systems and invitrogen corporation 
we have agreements in place with promega corporation and the regents of the university of california  under which we non exclusively sublicense several patents on a royalty bearing basis for use of a modified firefly luciferase gene in living organisms  such as our lpta animal models and certain of our bioware products 
other companies must obtain similar licenses from those two entities in order to use that gene as a tagging reagent in animal models for commercial purposes 
other companies can  however  create animal models using alternative technologies that do not contain luciferase 
creation of genetically modified animals 
we also compete with companies who produce genetically modified animals ie  transgenics or gene knockouts  including lexicon genetics and deltagen 
lexicon and deltagen both use animal models based on knockout mice technology 
lexicon  however  primarily focuses on developing its own pipeline of therapeutic products  rather than providing in vivo animal products and services to third parties 
other companies that perform in vivo animal production include artemis pharmaceuticals  genoway  ozgene pty ltd 
and ingenious targeting laboratory  inc we believe that  for certain applications  the combination of our genetically modified animal models with our in vivo biophotonic imaging technology provides more predictive data than our competitors can offer 
additionally  none of these companies offers a complete package of instrumentation and reagents for use in accelerating preclinical development 
phenotyping 
although many pharmaceutical companies perform phenotyping services internally  there are only a small number of companies that offer phenotypic analysis of animal models on a fee for service basis  including jackson laboratories  taconic farms  mds  inc  psychogenics  inc  charles river laboratories  and riken yokohama institute genomic sciences center 
however  we believe that xenogen biosciences offers a greater breadth and scope of pharmacologically validated bioassays and challenge assays 
additionally  we believe that the proprietary nature of our phenotyping program offers customers services that use fewer mice  and therefore are more cost efficient  than those offered by competitors or those available to large pharmaceutical companies from internal resources 
in vivo compound profiling analysis 
in addition to those competitors that conduct therapeutically focused or comprehensive phenotypic analysis of genetically modified animal models  there are other companies that have developed scientific platforms for the in vivo characterization of lead compounds  drug development candidates and or clinical development candidates 
this chemical characterization platform is known by various designations  but primarily as compound drug repositioning  repurposing and or indications discovery 
competitors in the in vivo chemical characterization space consist of those that focus primarily in one or a few therapeutic areas  such as sention  inc  vela pharmaceuticals  inc  bionaut pharmaceuticals inc  chemgenex therapeutics inc  and combinatorx inc  and those that have designed and validated comprehensive programs  such as gene logic inc  vanda pharmaceuticals and melior discovery  inc in many instances  our competitors have or may have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than we do 
many of our competitors also have greater name recognition than we do  and may offer more favorable pricing as a competitive tactic 
in addition  given the larger scale of their operations  many of our competitors spend more on research and development than we do 
accordingly  we cannot be sure that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products or that would render our technologies and products obsolete 
also  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies 
intellectual property we consistently seek thorough patent protection for our lab on a chip  imaging and other technologies 
as of december   we owned approximately issued us patents and pending us patent applications  some of which derive from a common parent application 
we are also the exclusive licensee of approximately us patents 
foreign counterparts of many of these patents and applications have been filed and or issued in one or more other countries 
we also rely upon copyright protection  trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive intellectual property position 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes  to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties  and to acquire licenses to enabling technology and products 
in addition  us patents filed since generally have a term of years from the date of filing 
in the life sciences industry  it often takes several years from the date of filing of a patent application to the date of a patent issuance  often resulting in a shortened period of patent protection  which may adversely affect our ability to exclude competitors from our markets 
microfluidics and laboratory automation 
a majority of our patents and applications are directed to various technological areas which we believe are valuable to our microfluidics and laboratory automation business  including control of movement of fluid and other material through interconnected microchannels  continuous flow  high throughput screening assay methods and systems  chip based assay chemistries and methods  chip compatible sample access  software for control of microfluidic based systems and data analysis  chip manufacturing processes  analytical and control instrumentation  analytical system architecture  and automated liquid handling systems 
we are also party to various exclusive and non exclusive license agreements with third parties which give us rights to use certain technologies in our microfluidics and laboratory automation business 
for example  we have exclusive licenses from ut battelle  llc  relating to patents covering inventions by dr 
j 
michael ramsey  and from the trustees of the university of pennsylvania covering microfluidic applications and chip structures 
these licenses extend for the duration of the life of the licensed patents 
a failure to maintain some or all of the rights to these technologies could seriously harm our business 
imaging 
we believe that our patent portfolio relating to in vivo imaging methods presents a significant barrier to entry for the commercial practice of our patented biophotonic imaging methods 
our imaging patent portfolio is built on two foundations methods  applications and materials relating to the biological aspects of biophotonic imaging  and methods and apparatus relating to the instrumentation aspects of biophotonic imaging 
we have also non exclusively licensed patents relating to methods of animal production that add value and accelerate the production of specific types of modified animals 
in addition to our foundational claims for methods of biophotonic imaging  our patent portfolio includes issued and pending patent claims for specific applications of biophotonic imaging and a number of areas that we believe will be valuable to our business  including animal models of disease  transgenic animals useful in drug discovery research  imaging system components and computer implemented methods for image acquisition and analysis 
we license several patents from third parties that are important to our imaging business 
our core imaging patents and related applications are licensed from stanford university on an exclusive basis 
the license is worldwide  royalty bearing and includes the right to grant sublicenses 
the term of this license is for the life of the patents resulting from the applications  which do not begin to expire until one of the patents that we have licensed from stanford covering our method of in vivo biophotonic imaging was subject to a re examination proceeding before the us patent and trademark office 
the re examination concluded in  and the patent and trademark office issued a re examination certificate for that patent with slightly narrowed claims 
such narrowed claims do not affect our current licenses or business 
in connection with our patent infringement lawsuit with anticancer  inc  anticancer is seeking a judgment to have this patent declared invalid 
for a description of our litigation with anticancer  see part i  item  legal proceedings 
on august   stanford university provided xenogen with a copy of an audit report prepared by a third party consultant which asserted certain claims of underpayments under the license agreement between stanford and xenogen during the period from through march   based upon the consultant s interpretation of xenogen s exclusive license with stanford 
upon review of the audit report  caliper determined that additional royalties of  were owed to stanford 
this underpayment was accrued as an assumed obligation as of august   in connection with caliper s acquisition of xenogen 
we are contesting the remaining payment obligation that is claimed in the stanford audit report  and as a result  we have not accrued for any liability beyond the  of royalties that have been accrued and paid 
we are currently discussing with stanford the scope of xenogen products that are subject to the royalty provisions of the stanford license agreement 
as a result of these discussions  the parties may amend the license agreement to change the royalties we pay to stanford for future product sales 
an amendment may also include the payment of back royalties to stanford for products xenogen caliper has already sold 
we have not discussed with stanford the specific terms and conditions of an amendment 
at any time  either party may choose binding arbitration to resolve any dispute over the amount of back royalties owed  if any 
the amount of any remaining contingent obligation  if any  cannot currently be estimated  nor is it probable that a liability exists 
however  we believe that this matter will be resolved within the next twelve months 
the right to use the specific luciferase gene in our lpta animal models and certain of our bioware products is licensed from promega corporation and the regents of the university of california under non exclusive  royalty bearing licenses 
the promega agreement continues for the life of the subject patent  which expires in promega  however  may terminate the agreement for breach of contract 
the regents agreement continues for the life of those subject patents  which expire in  however  the regents may terminate the agreement for breach of contract or failure to sufficiently commercialize luciferase bearing products 
xenogen s patents relating to the production of genetically engineered animals by using gene targeting methods have been licensed from medarex  inc  successor in interest to genpharm international  inc  since this license is non exclusive  royalty bearing and worldwide 
financial terms include a license issue fee  an annual fee that is creditable against earned royalties due  and a milestone fee in the event the fda approves a pharmaceutical product that includes a product produced through practice under the licensed patents 
the term of this license is for the life of the licensed patents  which are set to expire in trademarks 
caliper  including our wholly owned subsidiaries  has registered and applied to register a number of trademarks in the us and in foreign markets where its products are sold 
trademarks currently used by caliper include caliper  the caliper logo  labchip ht  labchip driven  caliper driven  labchip  the labchip logo  discovery alliance and services  zymark  librarycard  allegro  clara  multidose  prelude  rapidplate  rapidtrace  staccato  turbovap  twister  ilink  ilink pro  inl  desktop profiler  desktop profilerpro  profilerpro  zephyr  apw  tpw  sciclone  z  flit  automation certified  multifill  easyfill  presto  autotrace  zymate  easylab  and iblox 
novascreen  and rsmdb are trademarks of novascreen biosciences corporation  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of caliper 
xenogen  the xenogen logo  ivis  living image  lpta  bioware  vivovision  life changing  discovery in the living organism and discovery at the speed of light are trademarks of xenogen corporation  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of caliper 
environmental matters our manufacturing and laboratory sites utilize chemicals and other potentially hazardous materials  and generate both hazardous and non hazardous waste  the transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with state and federal laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed our resources 
we continuously assess the compliance of our operations with applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
our policy is to record liabilities for environmental matters when loss amounts are probable and reasonably determinable 
when needed  we have engaged environmental consultants to assist with our compliance efforts 
we believe we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental permits and are aware of our responsibilities under applicable environmental laws 
any expenditures necessitated by changes in law and permitting requirements cannot be predicted at this time  although we do not expect such costs to be material to our financial position  results of operations or competitive position 
government regulation our products and services are not regulated by any governmental agency 
our subsidiary  xenogen biosciences line of business associated with animal production  however  may  in the future  be subject to various laws and regulations regarding the treatment of animals if the federal animal welfare act  or awa  is amended 
the awa does not currently apply to rats of the genus rattus or mice of the genus mus  bred for use in research  and consequently  we are not currently required to be in compliance with the awa 
where applicable  the awa imposes a wide variety of specific requirements on producers and users of research animals  including requirements related to personnel  facilities  sanitation  cage size  feeding  watering and shipping conditions 
although the awa does not currently apply to our animal production business  we have voluntarily sought and received accreditation by aaalac  which sets industry standards for care and treatment of animals used in research 
in the event that the awa is amended to include mice or rats within the scope of regulated animals  and consequently  our animal production business  we believe compliance with such regulations would require us to modify our current practices and procedures  which could require significant financial and management resources 
we are not currently aware of legislation pending before the us congress to amend the awa to cover the mice or rats used by us 
in addition  some states have their own regulations  including general anti cruelty legislation  which establishes certain standards in handling animals 
with respect to the products and services we provide overseas  we also are required to comply with foreign laws  such as the european convention for the protection of animals during international transport and other anti cruelty laws 
the council of europe is presently considering proposals to more stringently regulate animal research 
many of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology licensees employ our technology to develop preclinical animal data on therapeutic products in development that may be submitted to governmental agencies as part of a regulatory application to commence human clinical testing or to commercialize their products 
it is our belief that preclinical data collected using our technology has been submitted by several of our clients and accepted by the fda to support commencement of clinical trials  and that in several cases regulatory approval has been received for a therapeutic product based  in part  on data collected using our technology 
there can be no assurance that the fda or other regulatory agencies will continue to accept preclinical data collected using our technology and submitted as part of an application to support initiation of clinical trials  or that such data can or will be used to support regulatory approval to commercialize therapeutic products 
additionally  exports of certain products and biological reagents to foreign customers and distributors are governed by the international traffic in arms regulations  the export administration regulations  the patriot act and the bioterrorism safety act 
although these laws and regulations do not restrict our present foreign sales programs  there can be no assurance that future changes to these regulatory regimes will not affect or limit our foreign sales 
other business risks in addition to the risks to our business associated with suppliers  competition and intellectual property discussed above  our business is subject to a number of other significant risks  including the risks that our products may not achieve wide market acceptance and that we may not be successful in developing new and enhanced products

item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our labchip products may not achieve widespread market acceptance  which could cause our revenue to grow slowly or decline and make it more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability 
the commercial success of our labchip products depends upon market acceptance of the merits of our drug discovery and automated electrophoresis separations systems by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic research centers and other companies that rely upon laboratory experimentation 
however  because our microfluidic drug discovery and automated electrophoresis systems have been in operation for only a limited period of time  their accuracy  reliability  ease of use and commercial value have not yet gained widespread commercial acceptance 
if these systems do not continue to gain further market acceptance  our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline 
in addition  our strategy for the labchip system  our microfluidic based screening product  depends upon the early users of these systems buying additional units as they spread the adoption of this technology throughout their organizations worldwide 
new customers for our drug discovery systems may wait for indications from our initial drug discovery system customers that our drug discovery systems work effectively and generate substantial benefits 
if the early users of our labchip systems do not endorse the further adoption of these systems because they fail to generate the expected quantities and quality of data  are too difficult or costly to use  or are otherwise deficient in meeting the screening needs of these customers  further sales of these systems to these early users may be limited  and sales to new users will be more difficult 
because drug screening systems represent substantial capital expenditures  it is important that these systems be capable of performing a wide variety of different types of assays and experiments in order to justify the cost of the systems 
we intend to continue to lower the cost of these systems and to develop new versions of our microfluidic based drug discovery systems with enhanced features that address existing and emerging customer needs  such as offering a broad range of standardized  easy to use assays 
in this regard  we recently launched a new labchip system  the desktop profiler  designed specifically to facilitate secondary kinase screening by providing a more highly automated system and making available our profilerpro reaction ready plates already loaded with required reagents 
if the commercial adoption of our other existing labchip products and this new labchip system is slower than we presently expect  we may experience a decline in revenue or slow revenue growth and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
for all of the foregoing reasons  we cannot assure you that our efforts to increase the adoption of our labchip based drug screening and automated electrophoresis systems  by both existing and new users  will be expeditious or effective 
in summary  market acceptance of our labchip systems will depend on many factors  including our ability to demonstrate the advantages and potential economic value of our labchip drug discovery systems over alternative  well established technologies  our ability to develop a broader range of standard assays and applications that enable customers and potential customers to perform many different types of experiments on a single labchip instrument system  our ability to penetrate the market for secondary kinase screening with our new desktop profiler and profilerpro products  and our ability to market and sell our drug discovery systems and related consumable products through our marketing and sales organization without the involvement of our senior management 
if our in vivo biophotonic imaging products and services do not become widely used by pharmaceutical  biotechnology  biomedical and chemical researchers  our revenue will grow more slowly than expected or decline and make it more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability 
we acquired xenogen corporation on august  in order to add its suite of in vivo biophotonic imaging products and other drug discovery and development services to our existing suite of in vitro products and services 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology  biomedical and chemical researchers have historically conducted in vivo biological assessment using a variety of technologies  including a variety of animal models 
compared to these technologies  xenogen in vivo biophotonic imaging technology is relatively new  and the number of companies and institutions using our technology is relatively limited 
the commercial success of these products will depend upon the widespread adoption of our technology as a preferred method to perform in vivo biological assessment 
in order to be successful  these products must meet the technical and cost requirements for in vivo biological assessment within the life sciences industry 
widespread market acceptance will depend on many factors  including the willingness and ability of researchers and prospective customers to adopt new technologies  our ability to convince prospective strategic partners and customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to other methods of in vivo biological assessment  our customers perception that our products can help accelerate efforts and reduce costs in drug development  and our ability to sell and service sufficient quantities of our products 
because our in vivo biophotonic imaging technology has not yet achieved widespread market adoption  our ability to assist the drug development process in leading to the approval of drugs with commercial potential has yet to be fully proven 
if commercial advantages are not realized from the use of in vivo biophotonic imaging  our existing customers could stop using our products  and we could have difficulty attracting new customers 
because of these and other factors  our biophotonic imaging products may not gain widespread market acceptance or become the industry standard for in vivo biological assessment 
we had no sales of our gcas automated target preparation system to affymetrix during the year ended december   and the future revenue growth of our laboratory automation business depends to a significant extent on additional sales of gcas systems by affymetrix 
if affymetrix discontinues selling the gcas system  or if end user demand for this product is not as strong as anticipated by affymetrix  our revenue targets may not be achieved 
in collaboration with affymetrix  we have developed a new automated system for the preparation of nucleic acid target material to be applied to affymetrix s genechip devices  which system is based on our sciclone liquid handling instrument 
affymetrix began to ship the commercial version of the gcas system during the third quarter of under the terms of the collaboration agreement  we supply the gcas system to affymetrix on an oem basis  and affymetrix markets and sells the gcas system to end user customers 
affymetrix announced in that low initial production yields of its commercial mapping k set array had constrained shipment volumes for this product 
because users of affymetrix s mapping k set array product are also expected to be users of the gcas systems  if affymetrix continues to have low production volumes for this product or experiences difficulties in launching other genechip applications  the demand for gcas systems will be adversely affected 
in addition  affymetrix may experience other difficulties in the marketing  sale  and support of the gcas system 
for these reasons  our revenues from the sale of gcas systems have been less than we originally anticipated  and had no revenue from the sale of gcas systems to affymetrix during we believe that affymetrix is addressing the production and other technical issues associated with its mapping k set assay products  and we presently expect our sales of gcas systems to affymetrix to resume during however  if affymetrix continues to experience production and other technical issues with its products  our revenue from the sale of gcas systems will be less than expected 
in addition  because the gcas system is a relatively new product for which there is limited commercial experience  there can be no assurance that the demand for this product will materialize as expected 
because we receive revenue principally from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and chemical companies and biomedical research institutions  the economic conditions and regulatory requirements faced by those companies and institutions and their capital spending policies may have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
we market our products to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and chemical companies and biomedical research institutions  and the capital spending policies of these entities can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
these policies vary significantly between different customers and are based on a wide variety of factors  including the resources available for purchasing research equipment  the spending priorities among various types of research companies and the policies regarding capital expenditures 
in particular  economic conditions and regulatory requirements faced by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have at certain times directly affected their capital spending budgets 
in addition  continued consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry will likely delay and may potentially reduce capital spending by pharmaceutical companies involved in such consolidations 
during the past several years  many of our customers and potential customers  particularly in the biopharmaceutical industry  have reduced their capital spending budgets because of these generally adverse prevailing economic conditions  consolidation in the industry and increased pressure on the profitability of such companies  due in part to competition from generic drugs 
if our customers and potential customers do not increase their capital spending budgets  because of continuing adverse economic conditions or further consolidation in the industry  we could face weak demand for our products 
similarly  changes in availability of grant moneys may impact our sales to academic customers 
recent developments regarding safety issues for widely used drugs  including actual and or threatened litigation  also may affect capital spending by pharmaceutical companies 
any decrease or delay in capital spending by life sciences or chemical companies or biomedical researchers could cause our revenue to decline and harm our profitability 
in addition  consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry may not only affect demand for our products  but also existing business relationships 
for example  if two or more of our present or future biophotonic imaging customers merge  we may not receive the same aggregate amount of fees under one license agreement with the combined entity that we received under separate license agreements with these customers prior to their merger 
moreover  if one of our biophotonic imaging customers merges with an entity that is not such a customer  the new combined entity may prematurely terminate our license agreement 
any of these developments could materially harm our business or financial condition 
our future revenue is unpredictable and could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
our operating results have been historically stronger in the fourth quarter due to the decision making process of our customer base 
xenogen s operating results have historically been stronger in the second and fourth quarters 
the sale of many of our products typically involves a scientific evaluation and commitment of capital by customers 
accordingly  the initial sales cycles of many of our products are lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews 
as a result of this lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle  our operating results have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter  and we expect this trend to continue 
in addition  a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed 
historically  customer buying patterns and our revenue growth have caused a substantial portion of our revenues to occur in the last month of the quarter 
delays in the receipt of orders  our recognition of product or service revenue or the manufacture of product near the end of the quarter could cause quarterly revenues to fall short of anticipated levels 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  less than anticipated revenues for a quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
accordingly  if our revenue declines or does not increase as we anticipate  we might not be able to correspondingly reduce our operating expenses in a timely enough manner to avoid incurring additional losses 
our failure to achieve our anticipated level of revenue could significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
the following are among additional factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period changes in the demand for  and pricing of  our products and services  the length of our sales cycles and buying patterns of our customers  which may cause a decrease in our operating results for a quarterly period  the nature  pricing and timing of other products and services provided by us or our competitors  changes in our renewable contracts  including licenses  our ability to obtain key components for products and manufacture and install them on a timely basis to meet demand  changes in the research and development budgets of our customers  customer resistance to paying technology licensing fees in conjuction with future ivis imaging system purchases  customer reactions to our recent merger with xenogen  acquisition  licensing and other costs related to the expansion of our operations  expenses related to our patent infringement litigation with anticancer and other litigation in which we are or may become involved  and expenses related to  and the results of  patent filings and other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter or annual comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
our intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful commercial protection for our products  which could enable third parties to use our technology  or very similar technology  and could reduce our ability to compete in the market 
we rely on patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws to limit the ability of others to compete with us using the same or similar technology in the us and other countries 
however  these laws afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights to the extent necessary to sustain any competitive advantage we may have 
in addition  our current and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the us or foreign countries 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights abroad 
these problems can be caused by the absence of adequate rules and methods for defending and enforcing intellectual property rights 
we will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent positions of companies developing tools for pharmaceutical  biotechnology  biomedical and chemical industries  including our patent position  generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions  particularly as to questions concerning the enforceability of such patents against alleged infringement 
the biotechnology patent situation outside the us is even more uncertain  particularly with respect to the patentability of transgenic animals 
changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the us and other countries may therefore diminish the value of our intellectual property 
moreover  our patents and patent applications may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
we also face the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies 
we own  or control through exclusive licenses  a variety of issued patents and pending patent applications 
however  the patents on which we rely may be challenged and invalidated  and our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
for example  in anticancer filed a lawsuit against xenogen alleging infringement of five patents and requesting that the court declare invalid one of our primary patents covering methods of in vivo biophotonic imaging 
for a description of our litigation with anticancer  see part i  item  legal proceedings 
we have taken measures to protect our proprietary information  especially proprietary information that is not covered by patents or patent applications 
these measures  however  may not provide adequate protection of our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
nevertheless  employees  collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information  and we may not be able to protect our trade secrets in a meaningful way 
if we lose employees  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees despite the existence of nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
we are currently involved in patent litigation and we may need to initiate other lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other proprietary rights  which would be expensive and  if we lose  may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights  which would reduce our ability to compete in the market and may cause our stock price to decline 
the patents on which we rely may be challenged and invalidated  and our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
for example  in anticancer filed a lawsuit against xenogen alleging infringement of five patents and requesting that the court declare invalid one of our primary patents covering methods of in vivo biophotonic imaging 
for a description of our litigation with anticancer  see part ii  item legal proceedings 
in addition  in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties  such as infringement suits or interference proceedings 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that those third parties may have access to substantially greater financial resources than we have to conduct such litigation 
these lawsuits could be expensive  take significant time and could divert management s attention from other business concerns 
these lawsuits would put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
additionally  we may suffer reduced instrumentation sales and or license revenue as a result of pending lawsuits or following final resolution of lawsuits 
further  these lawsuits may also provoke these third parties to assert claims against us 
attempts to enforce our patents may trigger third party claims that our patents are invalid 
we may not prevail in any of these suits and any damage or other remedies awarded to us  if any  may not be commercially valuable 
during the course of these suits  there may be public announcements of results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or others perceive any of these results to be negative  it could cause our stock price to decline 
acquisitions may have unexpected consequences or impose additional costs on us 
our business is highly competitive and our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products  introduce new products on a timely basis and offer our customers products that provide a more complete solution 
one of the ways we may address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies  such as our acquisition of zymark in july  our acquisition of novascreen in october  and our acquisition of xenogen in august from time to time  we consider and evaluate potential business combinations involving our acquisition of another company and transactions involving the sale of our company through  among other things  a possible merger or consolidation of our business into that of another entity 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies and products and services of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential cost and disruptions caused by the integration of financial reporting systems and development of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  accounting consequences  including amortization of acquired intangible assets or other required purchase accounting adjustments  resulting in variability or reductions of our reported earnings  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in these markets have stronger market positions  the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired company due to the employment uncertainties inherent in the acquisition process  the assumption of known and potentially unknown liabilities of the acquired company  the risk that we may find that the acquired company or business does not further our business strategy or that we paid more than what the company or business was worth  our relationship with current and new employees and customers could be impaired  the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees or third parties who believe a claim against us would be valuable to pursue  our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture and legal contingencies  among other matters  and there may be insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  or incur other large and immediate write offs 
we cannot assure you that future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business 
we must also maintain our ability to manage growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions that we make could harm our business 
our future revenue growth depends to a significant extent on the revenue growth of our novascreen business  which we acquired in october if novascreen s revenue does not grow as we anticipate  our future revenue targets may not be achieved 
in october we acquired novascreen biosciences corporation  a privately held business which provides in vitro high throughput screening and compound profiling services 
we completed this acquisition  in part  because we believe that the market for these services will grow at a relatively high rate as more pharmaceutical and biotech companies increase their outsourcing of these services 
there can be no assurance  however  that pharmaceutical and biotech companies will continue to increase their demand for these services 
if the trend toward more outsourcing of these services does not continue to grow  our revenues from the novascreen business may not increase as anticipated  making it more difficult for us to achieve our future revenue growth targets 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the xenogen acquisition 
the success of our acquisition of xenogen will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies  cost savings  and growth opportunities from integrating the businesses of xenogen with our business 
while our integration of xenogen is substantially complete  there are risks that could still adversely impact our ability to achieve all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  which include consolidating research and development and manufacturing operations  retaining key employees  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures  coordinating sales and marketing functions  preserving our and xenogen s research and development  distribution  marketing  promotion  and other important relationships  minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  and coordinating geographically separate organizations 
we cannot assure you that the integration of xenogen with us will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the merger 
we expect to incur future operating losses and may not achieve profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses each year since our inception and we expect to incur an operating loss in as of december   caliper had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
as of the effectiveness date of our merger with xenogen  xenogen had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development and product marketing and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
these costs have exceeded our cumulative cash proceeds which  to date  have been generated principally from product sales  collaborative research and development agreements  technology access fees  license fees  litigation settlement proceeds and interest income on cash and investment balances 
to achieve profitability  we will need to generate and sustain substantially higher revenue than we have to date  while achieving reasonable costs and expense levels 
we may not be able to generate enough revenue to achieve profitability 
we may not achieve or maintain reasonable costs and expense levels 
even if we become profitable  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if we fail to achieve profitability within the timeframe expected by securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  together with the revenue to be derived from our commercial partners and from commercial sales of our products and services  will enable us to maintain currently planned operations at least through the year however  we premise this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors  including the prospect of future acquisitions or other investing activities that could require substantial additional financing 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise needed capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
on august   we entered into a credit facility with a bank which permits us to borrow up to million in the form of revolving loan advances including up to million in the form of letters of credit 
this credit facility includes traditional lending and reporting covenants including that certain financial covenants applicable to liquidity and earnings are to be maintained by us and tested as of the last day of each quarter 
the credit facility also includes several potential events of default such as payment default  material adverse change conditions and insolvency conditions that could cause interest to be charged at prime plus two percentage points  or for any uncured events of default result in the bank s right to declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report  we were not incompliance with one financial covenant as of december  such covenant violation was subsequently waived by the bank and the covenant was also amended on a forward basis 
our ability to remain in compliance with applicable loan covenants through the credit facility s maturity in depends upon our results of operations not deteriorating or any other material adverse change occurring with our business  we may become in default of one or more covenants under the credit facility 
if such events were to occur  we currently have no alternative committed sources of capital 
in addition  to the extent that operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
the termination or non renewal of a large contract or the loss of  or a significant reduction in  sales to any of our significant customers could harm our operating results 
we currently derive  and we expect to continue to derive  a significant percentage of our total revenue from a relatively small number of customers 
if any of these customers terminates or substantially diminishes its relationship with us  our revenue could decline significantly 
our newly acquired xenogen business often sells products and provides services pursuant to agreements that are renewable on an annual basis 
failure to renew or the cancellation of these agreements by any one of our larger customers could result in a significant loss of revenue 
we may not fully realize our revenue under long term contracts  which could harm our business and result in higher losses than anticipated 
we have long term contracts for custom animal production and or phenotyping services with two customers that are renewed annually and are expected to generate future revenues 
these two long term contracts may not be renewed annually and may be terminated at any time during their terms 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain our sublicensed rights under certain patents relating to these contracts 
termination of these contracts for any reason would result in the loss of significant revenue would negatively impact our results of operations or limit our ability to execute our strategy 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
this risk is exacerbated because there are numerous issued and pending patents in the life sciences industry and  as described above  the validity and breadth of life sciences patents involve complex legal and factual questions 
our competitors may assert that their us or foreign patents may cover our products and the methods we employ 
for example  we are involved in patent litigation with anticancer in which it has alleged that we have infringed certain of its patents 
we have counterclaimed with allegations that anticancer infringes our imaging patents  as well as allegations that certain anticancer s patents are invalid 
for a description of our litigation with anticancer  see part i  item  legal proceedings 
also  because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products may infringe 
there could also be existing patents of which we are not aware that one or more of our products may inadvertently infringe 
from time to time  we have received  and may receive in the future  letters from third parties asking us to license certain technologies that the third party believes we may be using or would like us to use 
if we do not accept a license  we may be subject to claims of infringement  or may receive letters alleging infringement 
infringement and other intellectual property claims  with or without merit  can be expensive and time consuming to litigate and can divert management s attention from our core business 
if we lose a patent infringement lawsuit  we could be prevented from selling our products unless we can obtain a license to use technology or ideas covered by such patent or are able to redesign the products to avoid infringement 
a license may not be available at all or on terms acceptable to us  or we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid any infringement 
if we are not successful in obtaining a license or redesigning our products  we may be unable to sell our products and our business could suffer 
our rights to the use of technologies licensed to us by third parties are not within our control  and without these technologies  our products and programs may not be successful and our business prospects could be harmed 
we rely on licenses to use various technologies that are material to our business  including licenses  with sublicense rights  to certain microfluidic technologies and in vivo imaging methods  licenses to the use of certain biological materials  and licenses to engineer and commercialize transgenic animals 
we do not own the patents that underlie these licenses 
our rights to use these technologies and employ the inventions claimed in the licensed patents are subject to the negotiation of  continuation of and compliance with the terms of those licenses and the continued validity of these patents 
in some cases  we do not control the prosecution or filing of the patents to which we hold licenses  or the enforcement of these patents against third parties 
for example  under the promega corporation and the regents of the university of california licenses for a patented form of firefly luciferase used in our lpta animal models and certain of our bioware  we do not have the right to enforce the patent  and neither licensor is obligated to do so on our behalf 
certain of our licenses contain diligence obligations  as well as provisions that allow the licensor to terminate the license upon specific conditions 
some of the licenses under which we have rights  such as our licenses from the university of pennsylvania and from ut battele for certain microfluidic technologies and from stanford university for certain biophotonic imaging methods  provide us with exclusive rights in specified fields  including the right to enforce the licensed patents  but the scope of our rights and obligations under these and other licenses may become subject to dispute by our licensors or third parties 
for example  we are currently discussing with stanford the scope of products that we sell which are subject to the royalty provisions of our stanford license agreement 
as a result of these discussions  we may amend the license agreement to change the royalties we pay to stanford for future product sales 
the amendment may also include the payment of back royalties to stanford for products we have already sold 
we have not discussed with stanford the specific terms and conditions of an amendment or the amount of any back royalty payments 
any increase in the royalties we pay to stanford would negatively impact our gross margins 
our tax net operating losses and credit carryforwards may expire if we do not achieve or maintain profitability 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through beginning in the year if not utilized 
state net operating losses of approximately  expired in the current remaining state net operating losses have varying expiration dates through utilization of the federal and state net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
as of december   xenogen had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately and million  respectively 
the acquisition of xenogen resulted in xenogen shareholders owning approximately one third of caliper and will likely result in a change of ownership that will cause pre merger losses of the merged entities to be subject to limitation 
the amount of limitation has not yet been determined 
because of our lack of earnings history and the uncertainty of realizing these net operating losses  the deferred tax assets have been substantially offset by a valuation allowance 
if we are unable to meet customer demand or quality expectations  it would adversely impact our financial results and restrict our sales growth 
upon our acquisition of xenogen  manufacturing of ivis imaging systems was transferred to our manufacturing plant in hopkinton  massachusetts 
while our manufacturing group has considerable expertise with the manufacture of complex systems  we are relatively inexperienced in the manufacture of ivis imaging systems 
to be successful  we must manufacture our ivis imaging systems in substantial quantities at acceptable costs 
if we do not succeed in manufacturing sufficient quantities of our imaging systems to meet customer demand  we could lose customers and fail to acquire new customers if they choose a competitor s product because our imaging system is not available 
we believe our current manufacturing capacity in hopkinton  massachusetts is sufficient to meet our current and forecasted demand over the foreseeable future 
certain components of our ivis systems are specially manufactured by our limited and or single source suppliers and supply of these parts to us requires adequate lead time that can result in production delays 
if we experience unexpected shifts in customer demand that requires alterations to planned manufacturing  we may experience production delays that could restrict our sales growth 
if we are unable to meet customer demand for ivis imaging systems  it would adversely affect our financial results and restrict our sales growth 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components of ivis imaging systems  and we will be unable to manufacture or deliver our products if shipments from these suppliers are interrupted or are not supplied on a timely basis 
we use original equipment manufacturers  or oems  for various parts of our ivis imaging systems  including the cameras  boxes  certain subassemblies  filters and lenses 
we obtain these key components from a small number of sources 
for example  the lens for our ivis system is obtained from a single source on a purchase order basis from coastal optical systems inc  and the ccd cameras for all of our ivis imaging systems are obtained from two sources  spectral instruments  inc and andor technology limited 
we have binding supply agreements with spectral and andor 
from time to time  we may experience delays in obtaining components from certain of our suppliers  which may have an impact on our ability to produce imaging systems 
we believe that alternative sources for certain of these components in the event of a disruption or discontinuation in supply would not be available on a timely basis  which would disrupt our operations and impair our ability to manufacture and sell our ivis imaging systems 
our dependence upon outside suppliers and oems exposes us to risks  including the possibility that one or more of our suppliers could terminate their services at any time  the potential inability of our suppliers to obtain required components or products  reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery due to the difficulties in switching to alternative suppliers  the potential delays and expense of seeking alternative suppliers  and increases in prices of raw materials  products and key components 
we face competition from companies with established technologies for in vivo biological assessment  which may prevent us from achieving significant market share for our products 
we compete with a variety of established and accepted technologies for in vivo biological assessment that several competitors and customers may be using to analyze animal models 
the most basic of these technologies have remained relatively unchanged for the past years  are well established and are routinely used by researchers 
we believe it may take several years for all researchers to become fully educated about our in vivo biophotonic imaging technology 
we believe that in the near term  the market for in vivo biological assessment will be subject to rapid change and will be significantly affected by new technology introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
as other companies develop new technologies and products to conduct in vivo biological assessment  we may be required to compete with many larger companies that enjoy several competitive advantages  including established distribution networks  established relationships with life science  pharmaceutical  biotechnology and chemical companies as well as with biomedical researchers  additional lines of products  and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage  and greater resources for technology and product development  sales and marketing and patent litigation 
our principal competitors that use established technologies for in vivo biological assessment include exelixis  inc and lexicon genetics incorporated 
each of these companies uses animal models in the area of target validation in drug discovery and utilizes methods of assessment based upon knockout mice as well as other organisms such as fruit flies  worms and yeast 
we also face competition from several companies including eastman kodak company  berthold detection systems gmbh  hamamatsu photonics  olympus corporation  kk and roper scientific  inc  that market systems which may be used to perform biophotonic imaging with the appropriate licenses 
these companies are larger and have greater resources than we do 
there are also several privately held companies that have recently begun to market systems that may be used to perform biophotonic imaging with the appropriate licenses 
at any time  other companies may develop additional directly competitive products that could achieve greater market acceptance or render our products obsolete 
contamination in our animal populations could damage our inventory  harm our reputation and result in decreased sales 
we offer a portfolio of transgenic animals and lpta animal models for use by researchers in a wide range of research and drug discovery programs and also perform breeding and model validation 
we maintain animal facilities in alameda  california and cranbury  new jersey 
these animals and facilities must be free of contaminants  viruses or bacteria  or pathogens that would compromise the quality of research results 
contamination of our isolated breeding rooms could disrupt our models  delay delivery to customers of data generated from phenotyping and result in decreased sales 
contamination would result in inventory loss  clean up and start up costs and reduced sales as a result of lost customer orders 
in  one of xenogen s animal facilities in alameda was contaminated by a mouse virus introduced through one of our animal vendors 
that facility was closed for decontamination  and the most valuable strains were transferred to third party breeders for rederivation so that xenogen could continue to provide animals to its customers 
the decontamination process took approximately three months 
a similar contamination occurred again in terrorist acts  acts of war and natural disasters may seriously harm our business and revenues  costs and expenses and financial condition 
we rely on a single manufacturing location to produce our microfluidic chips and drug discovery systems  and a single location to produce laboratory automation  imaging and robotics systems  with no alternative facilities 
we rely principally on our facility in cranbury  new jersey  to produce lpta animal models and our facility in alameda  california to produce bioware cells and microorganisms 
alameda  california is also able to serve as a back up facility for producing our lpta animal models 
these facilities and some pieces of manufacturing equipment are difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time 
our manufacturing facilities may be affected by natural disasters  such as earthquakes and floods 
earthquakes are of particular significance because our labchip product manufacturing facility is located in mountain view  california  an earthquake prone area 
in the event that our existing manufacturing facilities or equipment are affected by man made or natural disasters  we would be unable to manufacture products for sale  meet customer demands or meet sales projections 
if our manufacturing operations were curtailed or ceased  it would harm our business 
terrorist acts  acts of war and natural disasters wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors and customers  any and all of which could significantly impact our revenues  expenses and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations that cannot presently be predicted 
we are largely uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts  acts of war and natural disasters 
we use hazardous materials in our business 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes  our anesthesia systems used with our ivis imaging systems to anesthetize the animals being imaged and our general biology operations involve the controlled storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials including  but not limited to  biological hazardous materials and radioactive compounds 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance 
we currently maintain a limited pollution cleanup insurance policy in the amount of million 
we may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms  or at all 
we could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations 
compliance with governmental regulations could increase our operating costs  which would adversely affect the commercialization of our technology 
the animal welfare act  or awa  is the federal law that covers the treatment of certain animals used in research 
the awa currently does not cover rats of the genus rattus or mice of the genus mus bred for use in research  and consequently  we are not currently required to be in compliance with this law 
currently  the awa imposes a wide variety of specific regulations that govern the humane handling  care  treatment and transportation of certain animals by producers and users of research animals  most notably personnel  facilities  sanitation  cage size  feeding  watering and shipping conditions 
if in the future the awa is amended to include mice or rats bred for use in research in the scope of regulated animals  we will become subject to registration  inspections and reporting requirements 
we believe compliance with such regulations would require us to modify our current practices and procedures  which could require significant financial and management resources 
furthermore  some states have their own regulations  including general anti cruelty legislation  which establish certain standards in handling animals 
to the extent that we provide products and services overseas  we also have to comply with foreign laws  such as the european convention for the protection of animals during international transport and other anti cruelty laws 
in addition  customers of our mice in certain countries may need to comply with requirements of the european convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes 
additional or more stringent regulations in this area could impact our sales of laboratory animals into signatory countries 
since we develop animals containing changes in their genetic make up  we may become subject to a variety of laws  guidelines  regulations and treaties specifically directed at genetically modified organisms 
the area of environmental releases of genetically modified organisms is rapidly evolving and is currently subject to intense regulatory scrutiny  particularly overseas 
if we become subject to these laws  we could incur substantial compliance costs 
for example  the biosafety protocol  an international treaty adopted in to which the us is not a party  regulates the transit of living modified organisms  a category that includes our transgenic mice  into countries party to the treaty 
as our mice are not intended for release into the environment or for use for food  feed or processing  the treaty imposes only identification  handling  packaging and transport requirements for shipments into signatory countries 
however  additional requirements may be imposed on such shipments in the future 
additionally  exports of our ivis imaging systems and biological reagents to foreign customers and distributors are governed by the international traffic in arms regulations  the export administration regulations  patriot act and bioterrorism safety act 
although these laws and regulations do not restrict our present foreign sales programs  any future changes to these regulatory regimes may negatively affect or limit our foreign sales 
public perception of ethical and social issues may limit or discourage the use of mice for scientific experimentation  which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business 
governmental authorities could  for social or other purposes  limit the use of genetic modifications or prohibit the practice of our technology 
public attitudes may be influenced by claims that genetically engineered products are unsafe for use in research or pose a danger to the environment 
the subject of genetically modified organisms  like genetically altered mice and rats  has received negative publicity and aroused significant public debate 
in addition  animal rights activists could protest or make threats against our facilities  which may result in property damage 
ethical and other concerns about our methods  particularly our use of genetically altered mice and rats  could adversely affect our market acceptance 
risks related to owning our common stock our stock price is extremely volatile  and you could lose a substantial portion of your investment 
our stock has been trading on the nasdaq global market only since mid december we initially offered our common stock to the public at per share 
since then our stock price has been extremely volatile and has ranged  through march  from a high of approximately per share on march  to a low of per share both on january  and february  our stock price may drop substantially following an investment in our common stock 
we expect that our stock price will remain volatile as a result of a number of factors  including announcements by analysts regarding their assessment of us and our prospects  announcements by our competitors of complementary or competing products and technologies  announcements of our financial results  particularly if they differ from investors expectations  and general market volatility for technology stocks 
these factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have been sued  and are at risk of future securities class action litigation 
in the spring and summer of  class action lawsuits were filed against certain leading investment banks and over companies that did public offerings during the prior several years  including lawsuits against caliper and certain of its officers and directors as described under part i  item  legal proceedings 
this and other securities litigation could result in potential liability  cause us to incur litigation costs and divert management s attention and resources  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  announcements of future lawsuits of this or some other nature  and announcements of events occurring during the course of the current and any future lawsuits  could cause our stock price to drop 
provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover  which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition in which we are not the surviving company or which results in changes in our management 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions may prohibit stockholders owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination which includes us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock

item legal proceedings commencing on june   caliper and three of its officers and directors david v 
milligan  daniel l 
kisner and james l 
knighton were named as defendants in three securities class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the cases have been consolidated under the caption  in re caliper technologies corp 
initial public offering securities litigation  civ 
sas gbd 
similar complaints were filed against approximately other public companies that conducted initial public offerings of their common stock during the late s the ipo lawsuits 
on august   the ipo lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial purposes before united states judge shira scheindlin of the southern district of new york 
together  those cases are denominated in re initial public offering securities litigation  mc sas 
on april   a consolidated amended complaint was filed alleging claims against caliper and the individual defendants under sections and of the securities act of  and under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as well as rule b promulgated thereunder 
the consolidated amended complaint also names certain underwriters of caliper s december initial public offering of common stock as defendants 
the complaint alleges that these underwriters charged excessive  undisclosed commissions to investors and entered into improper agreements with investors relating to aftermarket transactions 
the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of money damages 
caliper and the other issuers named as defendants in the ipo lawsuits moved on july   to dismiss all claims on multiple grounds 
by stipulation and order dated october   the claims against messrs 
milligan  kisner and knighton were dismissed without prejudice 
on february   the court granted caliper s motion to dismiss all claims against it 
plaintiffs were not given the right to replead the claims against caliper 
the time to appeal the dismissal has not yet expired 
in may  a memorandum of understanding was executed by counsel for plaintiffs  issuers and their insurers setting forth the terms of a settlement that would result in the termination of all claims brought by plaintiffs against the issuers and individual defendants named in the ipo lawsuits 
on july   a special litigation committee of the caliper board of directors approved the settlement terms described in that memorandum of understanding  which was subsequently set forth in a definitive settlement agreement among the settling parties 
on february   judge scheindlin issued an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement  subject to certain modifications 
the parties agreed to those modifications and on august   judge scheindlin issued an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement as modified and certifying settlement classes 
the fairness hearing for final approval of the settlement was held on april  before judge scheindlin issued any order regarding the court s decision with respect to the final approval of the settlement  on december  the court of appeals for the second circuit issued an opinion reversing judge scheindlin s prior certification of the plaintiff classes in several focus cases pending before her as part of the consolidated ipo lawsuits 
the plaintiffs have petitioned the second circuit for a rehearing on the class certification issue 
judge scheindlin has indicated that she will hold her consideration on the final approval of the settlement in abeyance until the second circuit decides whether it will review the december  opinion reversing judge scheindlin s prior certification of plaintiff classes in the focus cases 
the final resolution of this litigation is not expected to have a material impact on caliper 
on march   anticancer  inc filed a lawsuit against xenogen in the us district court for the southern district of california the court alleging infringement of five patents of anticancer 
the complaint seeks damages and injunctive relief against the alleged infringement 
on march   anticancer amended its complaint to include an additional claim seeking a judgment that one of our imaging patents exclusively in licensed from stanford university  us patent no 
 is invalid 
on may   xenogen filed its answer to anticancer s amended complaint 
xenogen denied all of anticancer s allegations and asserted various affirmative defenses  including its position that anticancer s patents cited in its complaint  and its patent claims relating to in vivo imaging of fluorescence  are invalid 
caliper is vigorously defending itself against anticancer s claims and believes anticancer s complaint is without merit 
concurrent with filing xenogen s answer to anticancer s complaint  xenogen had filed its own counterclaims against anticancer 
these counterclaims allege that anticancer infringes two of xenogen s us patents  nos 
 and  both relating to in vivo imaging and with a priority date before each of the anticancer patents alleged in its amended complaint 
both parties seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages  including enhanced damages for willful infringement 
caliper intends to vigorously pursue its claims against anticancer 
the court held the first three days of a markman hearing relating to these claims on june  through june  on july   xenogen filed a motion to disqualify anticancer s attorneys due to numerous violations of ethical rules by such attorneys 
after a hearing on this motion  on august   the court issued an order granting xenogen s motion to disqualify anticancer s attorneys 
on october   the court issued a supplemental and clarifying order to its previous august  order in which the court  among other things  i granted xenogen s motion to restart the markman hearing  ii granted xenogen s motion to prohibit the transfer of tainted files to anticancer s successor counsel  iii continued xenogen s motion for sanctions against anticancer s previous counsel  and iv granted anticancer permission until november  to amend its complaint 
on november   anticancer served its third amended complaint in this matter and voluntarily dismissed stanford university from this proceeding 
the third amended complaint adds caliper as a defendant 
in response to anticancer s third amended complaint  caliper has filed both i a motion to strike and for a more definite statement and ii a motion for sanctions including dismissal against anticancer for failure to comply with federal rule of civil procedure the court has scheduled a hearing on both of these motions for april  caliper currently is not able to predict the outcome of the patent infringement lawsuit with anticancer 
even if caliper prevails in this lawsuit  the defense of the lawsuit or similar lawsuits will be expensive and time consuming and may distract caliper management from operating caliper s business 
from time to time caliper is involved in litigation arising out of claims in the normal course of business 
based on the information presently available  management believes that there are no other claims or actions pending or threatened against caliper  the ultimate resolution of which will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity or results of operations  although the results of litigation are inherently uncertain  and adverse outcomes are possible

overview caliper life sciences sells products  services and integrated systems comprised of instruments  software and reagents to life sciences biomedical and pharmaceutical researchers 
we believe our offerings enable our customers to accelerate drug discovery  enhance the diagnosis of disease and facilitate scientific research 
caliper s strategy is to transform drug discovery and development through technologies and services that are relevant to and predictive of drug effects in humans 
our products and services  assembled from our leading portfolio of microfluidics  automation  liquid handling  and molecular imaging technologies  address key issues along the critical path of pre clinical drug discovery and development 
on august   we completed our acquisition of xenogen corporation 
xenogen develops and markets products  technologies and services for acquiring  analyzing and managing complex image data from live animals 
our acquisition of xenogen provides us entry into the fast growing molecular imaging market  and positions us as one of the first life science instrumentation companies able to provide an integrated portfolio of products and services for both in vitro referring to tests or reactions taking place outside a living organism and in vivo referring to tests or reactions taking place inside a living organism research 
a large majority of drug candidates that seem promising in early in vitro studies fail during pre clinical animal trials 
by tracking this drug attrition  understanding its root causes  and pursuing solutions  we believe we can improve the clinical relevance of early drug discovery and development 
the initial focus of our strategic effort has been to pursue oncology applications  and we are currently seeking new experimental models  techniques and tools that bridge in vitro and in vivo experimentation in this major therapeutic area 
future areas of interest include solutions for cardiovascular  metabolic disease and inflammation immunology therapeutic programs 
our products and services currently address some of the key challenges that face the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  including shrinking drug candidate pipelines  late stage drug failures  and unforeseen side effects coming to light late in the development process  or post commercialization 
using our products and services  researchers are able to increase the speed and efficiency of their screening efforts  make better choices earlier in the drug discovery and development process  and conduct profiling experiments that identify drug side effects well before the human clinical trial stage 
we are pursuing the application of our labchip technology to the diagnostics market and believe that our labchip technologies may be able to provide ease of use  cost and data quality benefits for certain diagnostic tests 
these benefits are the anticipated result of chip based integration  automation and miniaturization of the various workflow steps required to perform these tests 
we are presently working with collaboration partners in this area through our caliper driven program 
although most of these projects are still in the feasibility or early development stages  we believe that one of our caliper driven partners  agilent  expects to commercialize its first diagnostic test based on our labchip technology in we have multiple channels of distribution for our products direct to customers  indirect through our international network of distributors  through partnership channels under our caliper driven program and through joint marketing agreements 
through our direct and indirect channels  we sell products  services and complete system solutions  developed by us  to end customers 
our caliper driven program is core to our business strategy and complementary to our direct sales and distribution network activities  as it enables us to extend the commercial potential of our labchip and advanced liquid handling technologies into new industries and new applications with experienced commercial partners 
we also utilize joint marketing agreements to enable others to market and distribute our products 
by using direct and indirect distribution  and out licensing our technology under our caliper driven program  we seek to maximize penetration of our products and technologies into the marketplace and position caliper as a leader in the life sciences tools market 
overview of our acquisition of xenogen was a transformative event which we believe will significantly advance our capabilities as a leading provider of life sciences tools and services that are relevant to and ultimately predictive of clinical results 
as highlighted in the fda critical path initiative  biomarker research and better experimentation models are essential to improve predictability and efficiency along the critical path from laboratory to commercial drug 
we believe that the combination of our proprietary microfluidic and imaging technologies along with our automation expertise addresses these key research needs by creating molecular level solutions that encompass both in vitro and in vivo experimentation 
these technologies offer exceptional data quality and productivity advantages  and we believe that combining them to offer a highly correlated suite of products and services should result in earlier  clinically relevant insights in the drug discovery process 
we refer to the continuum of these solutions as the i i bridge  which stands for in vitro to in vivo testing bridge 
we achieved the successful and rapid integration of xenogen into caliper  and reduced combined annual spending by over million through staffing reductions and facilities consolidation 
we expect to begin benefiting at this rate of savings starting in the first quarter of the majority of cost synergies occurred mainly in manufacturing and general and administrative functions  and involved the elimination of redundant employment positions and excess facility needs 
other significant developments and trends during included the launch of five new products during the second half of these new products span our lab automation  microfluidics  and imaging product offerings  and include ivis spectrum in vivo imaging system with bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging capabilities  ivis lumina low cost in vivo imaging system  zephyr automated liquid handling system a compact liquid handling system with the advanced capabilities of our caliper sciclone liquid handler  which utilizes maestro  our new application software for liquid handling  labchip desktop profiler a microfluidic platform for the rapid profiling of kinases  and profiler pro a suite of reagent kits pre loaded with kinases for use with desktop profiler 
continued progress with the adoption of our labchip microfluidics technology 
we achieved growth in the number of labchip instrument placements with new labchip instruments placed  compared to in labchip sales were particularly strong throughout we also announced that canon us life sciences selected our microfluidics technology as the basis of development of canon s platform for nucleic acid diagnostics and screening 
in the fourth quarter we achieved initial sales of labchip desktop profiler instruments and profiler pro reagent kits and are encouraged by early customer response 
in addition  we believe that agilent is planning to commercialize it first bioanalyzer based diagnostic test in we feel that the long term growth prospects for microfluidics remains strong  although the market for our technologies may still take several years to develop 
strongly competitive conditions in the markets for our liquid handling and automation products 
our liquid handling and lab automation product revenues declined by approximately million in as compared to the overall decline resulted from our not having any gcas system sales to affymetrix in  compared to million of revenue from gcas system sales to affymetrix in recent customer consolidation and competitive market conditions may create challenges for expanding sales in this area of our business 
however  we believe that our new zephyr liquid handler  which was launched during the second half of and is targeted for therapeutic laboratories will help us grow liquid handling and automation product sales in we also believe that our sales of gcas systems to affymetrix will resume during formation of the caliper discovery alliances and services unit 
during the fourth quarter of  we combined our novascreen and xenogen biosciences into a new i i in vitro to in vivo services unit 
this combination enables us to offer a continuum of in vitro and in vivo screening  profiling and animal phenotyping services within a single organization 
we also signed a significant contract with pfizer expanding our services relationship to include an in vivo compound profiling program to address both primary and alternative drug indications as well as potential deleterious side effects 
financial performance we achieved million of total revenue in  an increase of from million of total revenue in revenues from xenogen and novascreen were the key growth drivers  offsetting a revenue decline in our liquid handling and automation business that was principally caused by the lack of any gcas system sales to affymetrix during product gross margins improved to in versus in as a result of increased utilization of our hopkinton  massachusetts facility due to the transfer of manufacturing operations for ivis systems to that facility during the second half of the year 
service gross margins declined to in from in due to the high fixed cost structure of the xenogen biosciences in vivo services facility in cranbury  new jersey 
we intend to address this cost alignment issue during through an increased volume of services business from pharmaceutical accounts  including the new pfizer agreement discussed above 
operating expenses increased million in in comparison to this increase reflects the incremental operating expenses of xenogen and novascreen  including additional amortization and intangible write off charges  and acquisition related restructuring charges 
as of december   we have completed the integration of xenogen 
we ended with million of cash  cash equivalents and investments  having exceeded our projected target minimum of million 
we also entered into a million bank credit facility that provides a source of borrowing to support our growth needs

our total revenue increase over resulted primarily from growth driven by our acquisitions of xenogen in august of and novascreen in october of product growth was mainly attributable to post acquisition sales of xenogen ivis imaging systems and other xenogen product sales  which totaled million 
this xenogen product revenue offset a decline in organic product sales caused mainly by a million decrease in revenue from gcas system sales to affymetrix in compared to although we had no additional gcas system sales to affymetrix during  we believe sales of gcas systems will resume in the second half of in vivo and in vitro drug discovery services provided by our xenogen and novascreen service groups  respectively  were the principal drivers of service growth during in comparison to in addition  license fees and contract revenue increased over as a result of a substantial license grant under our caliper driven licensing program 
our total revenue increase in resulted from growth in sales of our drug discovery product family  including the affymetrix gcas system  labchip systems  services including the drug discovery screening and profiling services of then newly acquired novascreen  and license fees under our caliper driven program 
these growth areas were partially offset by lower drug development product family and other instrument revenues 
product revenue 
product revenue increased during compared to primarily as a result of acquisition related growth from xenogen ivis imaging systems and other xenogen product sales  which generated million of revenue in the total number of ivis instruments sold during the year was  a increase over the units sold by xenogen in when xenogen was a stand alone reporting entity 
of the ivis units sold during  of these units were sold post acquisition and are included in caliper s product revenues 
excluding a million decline in gcas system sales to affymetrix  other product sales grew by million during compared to the primary elements of this increase were tpw instrument sales million increase and labchip system sales million increase  which offset our aggregate decline of million in other product areas 
during we placed a total of new labchip systems with customers versus systems in product revenue increased in due to a growth in our drug discovery product lines  which represented of total product revenue which was offset partially by a decline in our drug development product lines  which represented of product revenue 
increased sales of caliper sciclone based instruments to affymetrix  and to a lesser extent increased sales of our labchip and labchip systems and microfluidic labchip devices contributed to the revenue growth in the drug discovery area 
during  we placed a total of labchip systems in comparison to a total of systems during service revenue 
service revenue increased during in comparison to primarily as a result of acquisition related growth relating to our novascreen and xenogen operations 
during the year ended december   traditional product support services decreased by from due to of the retirement of older systems in the drug discovery automation serviceable installed base  as well as decreased installation services performed for affymetrix 
novascreen service revenues provided for the majority of the service revenue increase during  along with increases in other service offerings 
we acquired novascreen on october  license fees and contract revenue 
license fees and contract revenue increased during compared to  primarily as a result of small business innovation research grant projects conducted at novascreen and in vivo imaging license revenue generated by xenogen 
combined  these new sources of revenue generated approximately million of revenue  which offset by a decrease of million in third party funding of collaborative r d projects due to projects that were finalized in and during we also had a net increase of million from new licenses under our caliper driven program 
revenue from new licenses granted under our caliper driven program provided for the majority of the revenue increase in  partially offset by a million decline in third party funding of collaborative r d projects 
collaborative funding declined in due to the completion in of a major collaborative project effort with bio rad that resulted in the launch of bio rad s experion instrument in the fourth quarter of cost of revenue year ended december  change change year ended december  change change year ended december  in thousands cost of product revenue service revenue license fees total cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue increased during in comparison to primarily as a result of increased product sales including increases related to material costs of million  warranty costs of million  freight costs of million  sfas r stock based compensation expense of million and all other items of million 
manufacturing spending levels were relatively unchanged year over year except with respect to approximately million of transitional manufacturing spending incurred related to the acquisition of xenogen  including million in retention bonuses 
by the end of  all ivis imaging system manufacturing had been transferred to our facility in hopkinton  massachusetts 
as a result  these transition costs will no longer occur as of january  during  cost of product revenue increased primarily due to increased spending on materials 
our product mix in featured a greater proportion of revenue from sales of drug discovery instruments  including caliper sciclone sales to affymetrix and labchip systems  which bear a proportionately higher material cost as a percentage of revenue in comparison to our drug development and other specialty products 
in the fourth quarter of  we began an initiative to target material cost reductions through volume based purchasing economies  vendor outsourcing analysis and other identified opportunities 
in  we lowered our manufacturing costs by million 
this net decrease in spending was driven primarily by staff related cost reductions  including the elimination of a second manufacturing shift in our chip manufacturing operation  and reduced operating supplies usage 
these manufacturing savings were offset  however  by higher freight costs of million related to an increased number of shipments and higher fuel and other transportation charges  and other miscellaneous direct costs of million 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue increased during primarily due to service related costs of xenogen and novascreen which were new to caliper in in comparison to on a combined basis  costs related to these operations increased by million during the increase in cost of service revenue in included approximately million of service costs resulting from our acquisition of novascreen which was included in our operations only for the fourth quarter of the remaining net increase included million of allocated research and development staff related costs supporting assay development services  million of increased field service and customer support staff related costs  and an offsetting reduction of million due to reduced training costs as a result of training staff resources having been engaged to a greater extent in internal training and pre sales activities in gross margins 
gross margin on product revenue was for  as compared to during during  margins improved by percentage points primarily related to the increased utilization of the hopkinton plant driven by the acquisition of xenogen 
greater cost absorption due to volume and changes in product mix resulted in a percentage point improvement 
the increase was offset by approximately million  or percentage points  in transitional manufacturing costs related to xenogen s alameda  california  manufacturing facility  which remained open through october  in addition to the foregoing  the adoption of sfas r had a percentage point unfavorable impact on product gross margins in comparison to increased warranty costs resulted in the majority of the remaining percentage points which offset overall margin improvements 
gross margin on service revenue was for  as compared to in the decrease in in comparison to resulted from lower gross margins associated with xenogen and novascreen s drug discovery service revenues 
xenogen contributed approximately million of animal production and collaborative research revenue at a negative gross margin  while novascreen s overall gross margins were approximately for  in each case lower than our historical service business margin of approximately 
novascreen s service margins are currently influenced by a more significant proportion of government contract revenue than is typical of novascreen s historic business 
as service revenues expand  both for novascreen and xenogen  we expect to see increased gross margin on service revenues 
operating expenses year ended december  change change year ended december  change change year ended december  in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges credits  net research and development expenses 
the million net increase in research and development expenses during compared to included million of in process research and development expenses in connection with the xenogen acquisition and million of new spending  including million of imaging biology and physics research performed by xenogen  and million of grant related research and assay development research performed by novascreen 
xenogen s research and development spending comprised approximately million in labor related costs  million in facilities related costs and million of all other costs 
novascreen s research and development spending comprised approximately million in labor related costs  million in facilities related costs and million of all other costs 
in addition  the adoption of sfas r resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of million 
all other research and development expenses  consisting primarily of labor related costs and project materials  decreased by approximately million during compared to as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and development spending to generally decrease in the future  to the extent our revenues grow  and as we continue to closely manage discretionary spending on research programs with attractive commercial potential 
as part of our caliper driven program  we may undertake potential projects that could cause our research and development costs to increase as a percentage of revenue  although such increased spending may be fully or partially funded by our commercial partners 
in  the net decrease in research and development expenses was comprised of a million reduction for in process research and development charges  million of reduced staff related costs as a result of more focused project spending including approximately fewer r d personnel on average versus  million of reduced depreciation as a result of fully depreciated assets  million of reduced facilities and information technology cost allocation associated with lower staffing levels and square footage utilization by our r d group  million of increased project materials and other spending and million of new r d costs associated with our purchase of novascreen 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the net increase of million in selling  general and administrative expenses during compared to comprised million of new spending  including million of xenogen expenses and million of novascreen expenses 
in addition  stock based compensation expense included within our sg a expenses increased by approximately million related to the adoption of sfas r 
the remaining increase in sg a expense of million during the year included increased accounting  audit fees and consulting fees of approximately million which were largely related to xenogen integration related activities and strategic planning  million of increased legal expenses related to patent work  and increases in all other expenses of approximately million 
xenogen related sg a expenses included approximately million of labor related expenses  million of legal expenses consisting primarily of anticancer litigation costs  and million of spending across other areas 
the novascreen related expenses in this area comprised approximately million in labor related costs  million in facilities related costs and million of all other costs 
in  the net decrease in sg a expenses was attributable to a million reduction in depreciation as a result of fully depreciated assets and leasehold retirements  million of reduced professional costs including accounting fees  consulting expenses and outside patent costs  million of reduced miscellaneous taxes  insurance and other fees  and million of reduced miscellaneous spending across several expense categories  partially offset by spending increases including million of new costs added by novascreen and million of increased selling expense resulting from reallocated training department resources 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expense was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  related to assets acquired with our acquisitions of zymark  novascreen and xenogen 
amortization is computed based upon the estimated timing of the undiscounted cash flows used to value each respective asset over the estimated useful life of the particular intangible asset  or using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset when the pattern of cash flows is not necessarily reflective of the true consumption rate of the particular intangible asset 
amortization expense in included a charge of million related to the impairment of certain intangible assets established with the acquisition of novascreen 
the charge consisted of  related to the novascreen trade name and  related to government grants and contracts each of which was written off during the fourth quarter of the charge for the trade name relates to caliper s decision to combine its drug discovery screening and profiling services for both in vitro and in vivo research under a new trade name  caliper discovery and alliance services 
the charge for government contracts and grants resulted from a relative lack of success in obtaining new sources of government research and development funding  due to increased competition for funding 
restructuring charges credits 
we incurred restructuring charges in  and related to acquisition and integration activities that are more fully discussed in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
restructuring charges during relate to a charge for increased operating costs on idle facilities and accretion of interest on facilities  net of sub lease income 
in  we recorded a restructuring credit of million in connection with new subleases entered into during in determining the amount of restructuring credit to record  caliper considered all future sublease income for which we have reasonable assurance of collection and discounted the future cash flows using the same discount rate that was used originally to calculate the restructuring liability 
the restructuring credit includes sublease payments in of  net of broker fees of  we excluded million of future sublease income from this estimate due to the uncertain financial status of one sublease tenant 
we also recorded accretion expense and a corresponding increase in the short term restructuring liability of million 
interest and other income and expenses year ended december  change change year ended december  change change year ended december  in thousands interest income interest expense other income expense  net interest income interest income decreased in both and primarily due to lower cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  on average  over the previous years due to cash used in operating and investing activities

during  we incurred foreign currency transaction gains of approximately  compared to transaction losses of  in during  we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of approximately  compared to transaction gains of  in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term restricted cash  as compared to million as of december  and million as of december  in august  we acquired cash of million  net of acquisition costs  in connection with our acquisition of xenogen 
as such  our cash flow changes in operating assets and liabilities are net of acquired current assets and liabilities of xenogen 
in october  we used cash of million in connection with the acquisition of novascreen  which was net of million of novascreen s cash on hand on the date of acquisition 
as such  our cash flow changes in operating assets and liabilities are reported net of the acquired current assets and liabilities of novascreen 
on august   we entered into a credit facility with a bank which permits us to borrow up to million in the form of revolving loan advances including up to million in the form of letters of credit 
the credit facility will serve as a source of capital for our ongoing operations and working capital needs 
principal borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the prime rate if our unrestricted cash held at the bank exceeds million  or prime plus one half of one percentage point if our unrestricted cash held at the bank is below million 
under the credit facility  we are permitted to borrow up to million  provided we maintain unrestricted cash of at least million with the bank 
if we do not maintain million of unrestricted cash with the bank  our ability to borrow under the credit facility is subject to a borrowing base limit consisting of up to a of eligible accounts receivable  as defined  plus b the lesser of of caliper s unrestricted cash maintained at the bank or million 
the credit facility has a two year initial maturity 
during the first months following caliper s merger with xenogen  caliper is required to pay interest on a minimum of million of outstanding borrowings

in we used million of cash for operating activities which included approximately million of restructuring accrual lease payments  net of sublease income  primarily related to our idle facilities in mountain view  california and idle facilities established and assumed with the xenogen acquisition 
we also used approximately million to pay severance obligations related to the xenogen acquisition 
we are scheduled to pay approximately million in final severance payments to former xenogen employees during the first half of net operating results and all other working capital changes consumed approximately million of cash with approximately million being consumed from operating cash losses 
primary working capital effects on our cash included million of cash provided by tenant reimbursement funding from our hopkinton  massachusetts landlord  million used for inventory build up as a result of new product launches and slowed accounts receivable collections which used million 
our slower accounts receivable collection turnover resulted from uncollected balances assumed in our acquisition of xenogen and longer collection cycles that are associated with sales to academic and other not for profit institutions as well as sales to european customers 
on average  these customers pay more slowly from our historical experience 
all other working capital changes consumed cash of approximately million 
investing activities 
during  net proceeds from purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities and unrestricted cash generated million of cash  which we used for operations and property and equipment purchases 
our primary investing activities included purchases of property and equipment of million  of which the majority related to facility improvements made to our hopkinton  massachusetts headquarters 
as noted above  we received tenant improvement funding from our landlord reflected in operating activities which partially offset this investment 
in addition  we acquired million of cash  net of acquisition costs  in our acquisition of xenogen 
financing activities 
in  financing cash proceeds were principally comprised of proceeds from option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
during we established a credit facility with a bank and repaid existing debt assumed in connection with our acquisition of novascreen 
we used an initial draw under the credit facility to repay approximately million of assumed xenogen debt 
contractual obligations as of december   we had commitments under leases and other contractual obligations as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations severance obligations idle facility obligations total obligations in addition to the commitments in the table above  as of december   we had a non cancelable purchase commitment in the amount of approximately  with the foreign supplier of our glass stock used in the manufacture of certain types of chips and approximately million with one of our suppliers of cameras for in vivo imaging instrumentation 
these commitments are excluded from the above table due to the fact they are not specifically related to a given time period 
we also have minimum royalty obligations under separate license agreements with ut battelle  llc  the trustees of the university of pennsylvania  and certain other licensors that in the aggregate would never exceed  per year 
as of december   we have established million in standby letters of credit  which restrict available borrowing under our credit facility  related to facility leases and customer deposits 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  and acquisitions 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continuing our research and development efforts  expanding our support and product development activities  and for other general corporate activities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued market acceptance of our microfluidic and lab automation products  the magnitude and scope of our research and product development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors not within our control 
we ended with million in total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe our current cash balances are adequate to satisfy our cash needs through the end of notwithstanding  our actual cash needs could vary considerably  depending on opportunities and circumstances that arise over time 
if  at any time  cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to reduce our research and development efforts  sell additional equity or debt securities or draw down on our current credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the inability to obtain additional financing may force delays in research and product development activities and  ultimately  cause us to cease operations 
financial projections our revenue projection for the first quarter of is to million  representing growth of to  and our revenue projection for the full year is to million  representing growth of to 
we are projecting earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization costs to be positive in on a full year basis 
in addition  excluding cash payments to satisfy restructuring obligations due in  we expect to otherwise achieve positive operating cash flows as a result of earnings improvement and working capital reductions 
the financial projections that we have provided above are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and are only made as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
these projections are based upon assumptions that we have made and believe to be reasonable 
however  actual results may vary significantly from these projections due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business as described in item a  risk factors 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation and changing prices on our operations was not significant during the periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   caliper did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as that term is defined 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses  and assets and liabilities during the periods reported 
we use estimates when accounting for certain items such as warranty expense  sales and marketing programs  employee compensation programs  depreciation and amortization periods  taxes  inventory values  and valuations of investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to changing conditions or the validity of our assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  we allocate the consideration among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and consider the applicable revenue recognition criteria separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
we determine fair value of undelivered items based upon our historic selling prices  or where no historic information exists  based upon management s estimate of the probable selling prices for such undelivered items 
the amount of our product revenue is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether there is objective evidence of fair value for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
these conditions are sometimes subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
we recognize certain service and contract revenue for certain arrangements based upon proportional performance which requires that we estimate resources required to perform the work 
the extent to which our resource estimates prove to be inaccurate could affect the timing of the revenue recognition for a particular contract arrangement 
goodwill 
we perform a test for the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
because we have a single operating segment which is our sole reporting unit  we perform this test by comparing the fair value of the company with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the book value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  we calculate the potential impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the book value 
if the implied goodwill is less than the book value  an impairment charge would be recorded 
we performed our fiscal annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of based upon our market capitalization at the time  we concluded that we did not have any impairment 
valuation of intangibles 
our business acquisitions have resulted in intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization of million as of december  the determination of the value of such assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we acquired xenogen on august  in connection with this acquisition we used an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of intangibles related to the xenogen business 
the fair value was determined based upon projected future discounted cash flows of identified intangible assets taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets and assessments of the life cycle stage of developed technology 
the valuation approach took into consideration discount rates commensurate with the inherent risk and projected financial results associated with each identified intangible asset 
applicable discount rates used ranged from to 
we acquired novascreen on october  in connection with this acquisition we used an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of intangibles related to the novascreen business 
the fair value was determined based upon projected future discounted cash flows of identified intangible assets taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets and assessments of the life cycle stage of developed technology 
the valuation approach took into consideration discount rates commensurate with the inherent risk and projected financial results associated with each identified intangible asset 
applicable discount rates used ranged from to 
impairment 
we review long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we perform the recoverability measurement and estimate undiscounted cash flows at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable assets 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate the resulting impairment charge to be recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
actual cash flows could vary from the assumptions used in our assessment which could require future adjustments to our valuation of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
stock based compensation 
on january   we were required to adopt sfas r  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense  based on their fair values 
we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using a black scholes merton based option pricing model 
various assumption are used in these estimations  including expected volatility  which is based on historical volatility of our stock and warrants  expected option term  which is based on our historical option exercise data taking into consideration the exercise patterns of the option holders during the option s life  risk free interest rate  based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant  and forfeiture rate 
a unfavorable change in expected volatility and option term  which represent the most sensitive and judgmental assumptions  would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
prior to adopting fas r  we accounted for stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we have applied the modified prospective method in adopting fas r 
accordingly  periods prior to adoption have not been restated 
the implementation of fas r has had no adverse effect on our balance sheet or total cash flows  but it does impact our operating expenses  net loss and net loss per share 
because we are not restating periods prior to adoption  comparability between periods has been affected 
additionally  management uses estimates of and assumptions about forfeiture rates  volatility and interest rates to calculate stock based compensation 
a significant change in these estimates could materially affect our operating results 
accounts receivable reserves 
we grant credit to customers based on evaluations of their financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
we attempt to limit credit risk by monitoring our exposure for credit losses 
this analysis may involve review of historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends 
we establish allowances for those accounts considered uncollectible based on the analysis of the recoverability of our trade accounts receivable performed at the end of each reporting period 
establishing an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts involves the use of considerable judgment and subjectivity 
actual results could vary from the assumptions we use to estimate the adequacy of our accounts receivable reserves which could require future adjustment to our reserve provisions 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
we wrote off  and  of accounts deemed uncollectible in and  respectively 
inventory reserves 
we reserve or write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excess 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using management s best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
we use a twelve month demand forecast and  in addition to the demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be impacted by engineering changes  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
determination of the excess balance is highly subjective and relies in part on the accuracy of our forecasts and our assessment of market conditions 
if actual conditions are less favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  additional write downs may be required 
conversely  if conditions are more favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations in that period 
during  and  respectively  we recorded charges of   and million to cost of product revenues for excess and obsolete inventories 
warranty provision 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenue 
we offer a one year limited warranty on instrumentation products and a day warranty on chips  which is included in the sales price of many of its products 
our standard limited warranty covers repair or replacement of defective goods  a preventative maintenance visit on certain products  and telephone based technical support 
no upgrades are included in the standard warranty 
provision is made for estimated future warranty costs at the time of sale 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and cost per claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary 
during  and  respectively  we recorded charges of million  million and million to cost of product revenues for estimated warranty costs 
actual results could vary from the assumptions we use to establish the warranty liability which could require future adjustments to our reserve positions 
restructuring charges 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded restructuring charges credits of million  million  and million  respectively 
we established exit plans for activities which took place in the period and accounted for these plans in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  restructuring and impairment 
in accordance with such standards  management makes certain judgmental estimates related to these restructuring charges 
for example  the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates including with respect to contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space being vacated and related costs  and ability of the tenant to pay leasehold improvement write downs  offset by estimated sublease income 
we review on at least a quarterly basis our sublease assumptions 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of the sublease arrangement 
if the rental markets change  our sublease assumptions may not be accurate and changes in these estimates might be necessary and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in december  we recorded a restructuring credit of approximately million to recognize the net present value of future sublease rental income based upon subleases we were able to secure during for a further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
the interpretation requires that we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority 
if a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition criteria  fin requires the tax position be measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
this accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating fin and the effect  if any  that it will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the effect  if any  of adopting sfas on our financial position and results of operations has not been determined

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency as a multinational company  we are subject to changes in foreign currency fluctuations 
we have operations in the united kingdom  france  germany  belgium  switzerland  canada and japan 
to the extent our sales and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in exchange rates 
while foreign exchange gains and losses have historically been immaterial  we cannot predict whether such gains and losses will continue to be immaterial 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in exchange rates applied to our projected foreign operations for the fiscal year a hypothetical movement in exchange rates could materially impact our reported sales 
however  because both sales and expenses are denominated in local currency  this analysis indicated that such movement would not have a material effect on net operating results or financial condition 
translation gains and losses related to our foreign subsidiaries are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  but may do so in the future 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would not have materially impacted net income or materially affected the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments at either december  or as of december  we had million in debt outstanding under our credit facility 
the interest rate on the facility is based on the prime rate currently and therefore has direct and immediate response to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities  and corporate bonds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
as of december  and  the average remaining maturities of our investment portfolio were approximately five and six months  respectively 
all of our instruments are held other than for trading purposes 
as of december  and  unrealized losses were considered to be temporary due to the fact  although available to be sold to meet operating needs or otherwise  securities are generally held to maturity
