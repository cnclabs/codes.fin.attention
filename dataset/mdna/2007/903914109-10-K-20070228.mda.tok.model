item properties 
location and characteristics the company depends on oil and natural gas leases in wyoming and pennsylvania and two psc s in china in order to explore for and produce oil and natural gas 
the leases in wyoming are primarily federal leases with year lease terms until establishment of production 
production on a lease extends the lease terms until cessation of that production 
there are leases totaling approximately  gross  net acres currently held by production hbp in wyoming 
the hbp acreage includes all of the company s leases held within the productive area of the pinedale and jonah fields 
the leases in pennsylvania are all from private individuals  typically with lease terms of five years until establishment of production 
production on the pennsylvania leases extends the lease terms until cessation of that production 
there are approximately gross net acres currently held by production in pennsylvania 
the china petroleum contracts extend for a maximum of years and are divided into three periods  exploration  development and production 
the exploration period is for approximately seven years and work is to be performed and expenditures are to be incurred to delineate the extent and amount of hydrocarbons  if any  for each block 
the development period occurs when a field is discovered and commences on the date of approval of the ministry of energy 
there is no limit on the time allowed to develop a field other than the combined maximum of years 
the production period of any oil and natural gas field in a block is a period of consecutive years beginning on the date of commencement of commercial production from the field  unless extended 
all of the company s chinese proved reserves are estimated to be recovered within the current license terms 
green river basin  wyoming as of december   the company owned developed oil and natural gas leases totaling  gross  net acres in the green river basin of sublette county  wyoming which represents of the company s total domestic developed net acreage 
the company owns undeveloped oil and natural gas leases totaling  gross  net acres in the green river basin of sublette county  wyoming which represents of the company s total domestic undeveloped net acreage 
the company s acreage in the green river basin primarily covers the pinedale field with several other undeveloped acreage blocks north and west of the pinedale field as well as acreage in the jonah field 
holding costs of leases in wyoming not held by production were approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  the primary target on the company s wyoming acreage is the tight gas sands of the upper cretaceous lance pool formation 
exploratory wells 
during  the company participated in the drilling of a total of gross net productive exploratory wells on the green river basin properties 
at december   there were gross net additional exploratory wells that commenced during the year that were either still drilling or had drilling 
table of contents operations suspended at a depth short of total depth and thus a determination of productive capability could not be made at year end 
development wells 
during  the company participated in the drilling of gross net productive development wells on the green river basin properties 
at year end  there were gross net additional development wells that commenced during and were either still drilling or had drilling operations suspended at a depth short of total depth 
for purposes of this report  development wells are wells identified as proven  undeveloped locations by the company s independent petroleum engineering firm  netherland  sewell associates  inc  at the previous year end reserve evaluation 
when drilled  these locations will be counted as development wells 
bohai bay  china block the psc covering this block became effective october  negotiations with the chinese government in resulted in an extension of the third exploration term to september barring another extension  at that time  all acreage not under appraisal  development or production must be relinquished 
the company holds an exploration interest in the exploration portion of the block and an working interest in the cfd and and the cfd and fields 
this block covers  gross  net acres under the exploration phase and  gross  net acres under development  or approximately of the company s total net international acreage 
block the psc covering this block became effective march  negotiations with cnooc in early resulted in a two year extension of the third exploration term to february  when  barring an extension  all acreage not under appraisal  development or production must be relinquished 
the company holds a exploration interest in this block which covers  gross  net acres under the exploration phase and  gross  acres under development 
this acreage constitutes approximately of the company s total net international acreage 
block and block unitized development three new fields  cfd in the block and cfd and s in the block came on production in because the fields were located in close proximity  the blocks were developed under a single development plan 
further  because two of the fields were located in the block and one was located in the block with different parties having different levels of interest in the two blocks  the three fields were unitized and a unitization agreement was executed that assigned the company a working interest in the combined field unit 
exploration appraisal activity in  the company participated in drilling exploration well net which failed to find commercial quantities of oil 
the primary target formations on the blocks are the upper and lower minghuazhen  guantao and dongying formations 
development activity in july  the company began production at the cfd and fields on the block 
development drilling at these fields continued through mid as of december   the company has participated in drilling a total of production wells at the cfd and fields 
in july  the company commenced production at the cfd and fields on the block 
the company has participated in drilling a total of production wells at the cfd and fields 
in late september  the company commenced production at the cfd  and s fields 
the company has participated in drilling a total of production wells at the cfd  and s fields 
the seven field production complex consists of gross net production wells  six production platforms and an anchored fpso vessel 
upon declaration of commerciality of a field or area by cnooc  the company s share of all expenses within that area is decreased by  with the participation of cnooc 
for example  the company s exploration interest is reduced to an working interest in the fields on production in the block 
upon initiation of production  the sharing of production is determined by the language of the psc which states that for each individual field a chinese national industrial tax and royalty are applied to of the gross volumes of oil  lease operating expenses loe are then taken out of the remainder oil and after these deductions  of the remaining production stream is dedicated to exploration and development cost recovery for the participants 
the exploration cost recovery will be recovered without interest  while the development cost recovery will be 
table of contents calculated with a fixed annual interest rate of uplift  and the remaining of production goes to the remainder oil category which is divided into a share oil for cnooc and an allocable remainder oil for the contractors determined by a sliding scale determined by yearly production  x factor 
project profit is subject to a chinese corporate tax 
during  the chinese government levied the petroleum special profits tax which is dependent on the sales price of oil production 
on october   a year contract  which provides for extension for up to an additional years  was signed by the operator to lease an fpso 
the company ratified the contract 
the fpso is a  dead weight ton  double hull fpso with a  barrel storage capacity  a single point mooring and a processing plant capable of processing  barrels of oil per day expandable to  barrels of oil per day 
the fpso service agreement calls for a day rate lease payment and a sliding scale per barrel payment that decreases based on cumulative barrels processed 
pennsylvania as of december   the company owned developed oil and gas leases totaling gross net acres in the pennsylvania portion of the appalachian basin which represents of the company s total domestic developed net acreage 
the company owns undeveloped oil and gas leases totaling  gross  net acres in this area which represents of the company s total domestic undeveloped net acreage 
the company s acreage in pennsylvania covers the marshlands prospect and several other prospects in the surrounding area 
holding costs of leases in pennsylvania not held by production were approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  exploratory wells 
during the year ended december   the company participated in the drilling and completion of a total of one gross net well which was completed as a field discovery from the silurian tuscarora formation 
the well was placed into production during may of this well continues to produce at rates of approximately mmcf of gas per day at flowing pressures over  psi casing pressure 
during the year ended december   the company also participated in the drilling of a total of gross net exploratory wells on the pennsylvania properties 
one gross 
net well was drilled to test the oriskany sand and marcellus shale sections and was being evaluated at december  one gross net well  to test the trenton and black river formations at the marshlands prospect  was drilling at december  during  on the newly acquired acreage position  the company acquired a d seismic survey covering a large prospect area 
processing and interpretation of this data set is ongoing

the following discussion of the financial condition and operating results of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the company 
except as otherwise 
table of contents indicated all amounts are expressed in us dollars 
we have one operating segment  natural gas and oil exploration and development with two geographical segments  the united states and china 
the company currently generates the majority of its revenue  earnings and cash flow from the production and sales of natural gas and oil from its property in southwest wyoming 
the price of natural gas in the southwest wyoming region is a critical factor to the company s business 
the price of natural gas in southwest wyoming historically has been volatile 
the average annual realizations for the period have ranged from to per mcf 
this volatility could be detrimental to the company s financial performance 
the company seeks to limit the impact of this volatility on its results by entering into forward sales and derivative contracts for natural gas in southwest wyoming 
the average realization for the company s natural gas during calendar was per mcf  basis opal  wyoming  including the effect of hedges 
for the quarter ended december   the average realization for the company s natural gas was per mcf  basis opal  wyoming  including the effect of hedges 
on july  the company initiated production at the first two fields of the nine fields discovered on its oil properties offshore bohai bay  china 
production from these fields is characterized as heavy  sweet crude 
the company sold its first cargo of oil in september during the twelve month period ended december   the company sold  barrels of its chinese oil production at a price based on the official icp posting for duri field crude  less a discount for location and quality differences 
the majority of these sales were made to an affiliate of cnooc at an average price of usd per barrel for the year ended december  for the quarter ended december   the company sold  barrels of its chinese crude for an average price of usd per barrel 
there can and will be differences in timing between the sale of the company s crude oil cargos and the company s pro rata share of production 
as a result of these timing differences  the company may  from time to time  carry inventories or imbalances of crude oil 
as of february   the duri price was approximately usd before discount per barrel 
the company expects to sell at least one cargo of its chinese crude oil production approximately every two months during the company has the right to export and sell its crude at market prices into the international markets 
other markets for the company s chinese oil may potentially be developed in south korea  japan  singapore or other countries 
the company has grown its natural gas and oil production significantly over the past five years and management believes it has the ability to continue growing production by drilling already identified locations on its leases in wyoming and by bringing into production the already discovered oil fields in china 
the company delivered production growth on an mcfe basis during the quarter ended december  as compared to the same quarter in and production growth for the year ended december  compared to the same period in management expects to deliver additional production growth during by drilling and bringing into production additional wells in wyoming and bringing into production additional fields in china 
production bcfe the company conducts operations in both the united states and china 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which the company has operations 
substantially all of the oil and natural gas activities are conducted jointly with others and  accordingly  amounts presented reflect only the company s proportionate interest in such activities 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition  application of gaap requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and  accordingly  actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
set forth below is a discussion of the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial 
table of contents statements which we believe involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
these policies relate to estimates of volumes of oil and natural gas reserves used in calculating depletion  the amount of standardized measure used in computing the ceiling test limitations and the amount of abandonment obligations used in such calculations 
assumptions  judgments and estimates are also required in determining impairments of undeveloped properties and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
oil and gas reserves 
the term proved reserves is defined by the sec in rule a of regulation s x under the securities act of in general  proved reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie prices and costs at the date of the estimate 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided by contractual arrangements  but not escalated based on future economic conditions 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the company s dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves may result from lower prices  evaluation of additional operating history  mechanical problems on our wells and catastrophic events such as explosions  hurricanes and floods 
lower prices also make it uneconomical to drill wells or produce from fields with high operating costs 
our proved reserves are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate materially from actual results 
as a result  our estimates of proved reserves could vary over time  and could vary from actual results 
full cost method of accounting 
the accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires that we choose between gaap alternatives 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas operations 
under this method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which the company incurs costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development costs of oil and natural gas properties for each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method 
changes in estimates of proved reserves  future development costs or asset retirement obligations are accounted for prospectively in our depletion calculation 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter on a country by country basis 
the ceiling limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the after tax  present value  discounted at  of future net revenues attributable to proved reserves  known as the standardized measure  plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
if such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling  the company will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower dd a expense in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the company did not have any write downs related to the full cost ceiling limitation in   or as of december   the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of the company s oil and natural gas properties 
estimates of standardized measure at december  were based on realized natural gas prices which averaged per mcf in wyoming and per mcf in pennsylvania and on realized liquids prices which averaged per barrel in the us in china  estimates of discounted future net cash flows on crude oil were based on a net realized price of per barrel 
a reduction in oil and natural gas prices and or estimated 
table of contents quantities of oil and natural gas reserves would reduce the ceiling limitation and could result in a ceiling test write down 
asset retirement obligation 
the company s asset retirement obligations aro consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and natural gas properties 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and natural gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an aro  estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted  risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  the company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a 
entitlements method of accounting for oil and natural gas sales 
the company generally sells natural gas  condensate and crude oil under both long term and short term agreements at prevailing market prices and under multi year contracts that provide for a fixed price of oil and natural gas 
the company recognizes revenues when the oil and natural gas is delivered  which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership  prices are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company accounts for oil and natural gas sales using the entitlements method 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based upon the company s ownership share of volumes sold  regardless of whether it has taken its ownership share of such volumes 
the company records a receivable or a liability to the extent it receives less or more than its share of the volumes and related revenue 
make up provisions and ultimate settlements of volume imbalances are generally governed by agreements between the company and its partners with respect to specific properties or  in the absence of such agreements  through negotiation 
the value of volumes over or under produced can change based on changes in commodity prices 
the company prefers the entitlements method of accounting for oil and natural gas sales because it allows for recognition of revenue based on its actual share of jointly owned production  results in better matching of revenue with related operating expenses  and provides balance sheet recognition of the estimated value of product imbalances 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis temporary differences 
to assess the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
as of december   the company had net deferred tax assets totaling million which management considers is more likely than not to be realized 
commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company may  from time to time  enter into commodity derivative contracts and or fixed price physical contracts to manage its exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
the company has  in the past  primarily utilized fixed price forward sales of physical gas when it hedges some portion of its wyoming natural gas production 
these transactions are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counterparties of high credit quality that present minimal credit risks to the company 
the company may also secure payments under these types of transactions by requiring the counterparty to provide letter s of credit 
on a less frequent basis  the company may enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage price volatility 
to the extent that it does enter into such derivative transactions  the company expects that the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivatives contracts will be based upon crude oil and or natural gas futures contracts which  when adjusted for location basis differentials  will have a high degree of

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
for qualifying fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is offset by the related results of the hedged item in the income statement 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company currently does not have any derivative contracts related to the marketing of its natural gas or oil production in effect  the last one having expired on december  legal  environmental and other contingencies 
a provision for legal  environmental and other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determines when the company should record losses for these items based on information available to the company

for the periods prior to january   the company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
under sfas no 
and apb no 
 the company utilized a black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
for additional information  see note the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because the company s employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in management s opinion  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the company s employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas no
