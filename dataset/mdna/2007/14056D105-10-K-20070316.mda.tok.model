risk factors 
an investment in capitol s common stock is subject to the risks inherent to capitol s business 
the material risks and uncertainties that capitol believes affect it are described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones capitol faces 
additional risks and uncertainties that capitol is not aware of or focused on or currently deems immaterial may also impair business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  capitol s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of capitol s common stock could decline significantly  and shareholders could lose all or part of their investment 
newly formed banks are likely to incur significant operating losses that could negatively affect the availability of earnings to support future growth 
many of capitol s bank subsidiaries are less than three years old and capitol s oldest bank is twenty five years old 
capitol engaged in significant new bank development activity in recent periods 
newly formed banks are expected to incur operating losses in their early periods of operation because of an inability to generate sufficient net interest income to cover operating costs 
newly formed banks may never become profitable 
current accounting rules require immediate write off  rather than capitalization  of start up costs and  as a result  future newly formed banks are expected to report larger early period operating losses 
those operating losses can be significant and can occur for longer periods than planned depending upon the ability to control operating expenses and generate net interest income  which could affect the availability of earnings retained to support future growth 
if capitol is unable to manage its growth  its ability to provide quality services to customers could be impaired and cause its customer and employee relations to suffer 
capitol has rapidly and significantly expanded its operations  engaged in significant new bank development activity in and anticipates that further expansion will be required to realize its growth strategy 
capitol s rapid growth has placed significant demands on its management and other resources which  given its expected future growth rate  are likely to continue 
to manage future growth  capitol will need to attract  hire and retain highly skilled and motivated officers and employees and improve existing systems and or implement new systems for transaction processing  operational and financial management  and training  integrating and managing capitol s growing employee base 
favorable environment for formation of new banks could change adversely  which could severely limit capitol s expansion opportunities 
capitol s growth strategy includes the addition of new banks 
thus far  capitol has experienced favorable business conditions for the formation of its small  community and customer focused banks 
those favorable conditions could change suddenly or over an extended period of time 
a change in the availability of financial capital  human resources or general economic conditions could eliminate or severely limit expansion opportunities 
to the extent capitol is unable to effectively attract personnel and deploy its capital in new or existing banks  this could adversely affect future asset growth  earnings and the value of capitol s common stock 
item a 
risk factors continued 
capitol s banks small size may make it difficult to compete with larger institutions because capitol is not able to compete with large banks in the offering of significantly larger loans 
capitol endeavors to capitalize its newly formed banks with a moderate dollar amount permitted by regulatory agencies 
as a result  the legal lending limits of capitol s banks severely constrain the size of loans that those banks can make 
in addition  many of the banks competitors have significantly larger capitalization and  hence  an ability to make significantly larger loans 
the inability to offer larger loans limits the revenues that can be earned from interest amounts charged on larger loan balances 
capitol s banks are intended to be small in size 
many operate from single locations 
they are small relative to the dynamic markets in which they operate 
each of those markets has a variety of large and small competitors that have resources far beyond those of capitol s banks 
while it is the intention of capitol s banks to operate as niche players within their geographic markets  their continued existence is dependent upon being able to attract and retain loan customers in those large markets that are dominated by substantially larger regulated and unregulated financial institutions 
if capitol cannot recruit additional highly qualified personnel  capitol s customer service could suffer  causing its customer base to decline 
capitol s strategy is also dependent upon its continuing ability to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel 
competition for such employees among financial institutions is intense 
availability of personnel with appropriate community banking experience varies 
if capitol does not succeed in attracting new employees or retaining and motivating current and future employees  capitol s business could suffer significantly 
capitol and its banks operate in an environment highly regulated by state and federal government  changes in federal and state banking laws and regulations could have a negative impact on capitol s business 
as a bank holding company  capitol is regulated primarily by the federal reserve board 
capitol s current bank affiliates are regulated primarily by the state banking regulators and the fdic and  in the case of one national bank  the office of the comptroller of the currency occ 
federal and the various state laws and regulations govern numerous aspects of the banks operations  including adequate capital and financial condition  permissible types and amounts of extensions of credit and investments  permissible nonbanking activities  and restrictions on dividend payments 
federal and state regulatory agencies have extensive discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies 
capitol and its banks also undergo periodic examinations by one or more regulatory agencies 
following such examinations  capitol may be required  among other things  to change its asset valuations or the amounts of required loan loss allowances or to restrict its operations 
those actions would result from the regulators judgments based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
item a 
risk factors continued 
the banks operations are required to follow a wide variety of state and federal consumer protection and similar statutes and regulations 
federal and state regulatory restrictions limit the manner in which capitol and its banks may conduct business and obtain financing 
those laws and regulations can and do change significantly from time to time  and any such change could adversely affect capitol 
regulatory action could severely limit future expansion plans 
to carry out some of its expansion plans  capitol is required to obtain permission from the federal reserve board 
applications for the formation of new banks are submitted to the state and federal bank regulatory agencies for their approval 
while capitol s prior experience with the regulatory application process has been favorable  the future climate for regulatory approval is impossible to predict 
regulatory agencies could prohibit or otherwise significantly restrict the expansion plans of capitol  its current bank subsidiaries and future new start up banks 
new accounting or tax pronouncements or interpretations may be issued by the accounting standard setters  regulators or other government bodies which could change existing accounting methods 
changes in accounting could negatively impact capitol s results of operations and financial condition 
current accounting and tax rules  standards  policies  and interpretations influence the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
events that may not have a direct impact on capitol  such as the bankruptcy of major us companies  have resulted in legislators  regulators  and authoritative bodies  such as the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  the public company accounting oversight board  and various taxing authorities responding by adopting and or proposing substantive revisions to laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations 
new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
a change in accounting standards may adversely affect reported financial condition and results of operations 
capitol s business continuity plans or data security systems could prove to be inadequate  resulting in a material interruption in  or disruption to  its business and a negative impact on the results of operations 
capitol relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems  whether due to severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism  criminal activity or other factors  could result in failures or disruptions in general ledger  deposit  loan  customer relationship management and other systems 
while capitol has disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of capitol s information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of capitol s information systems could damage the reputation of capitol and its banks  result in a loss of customer business  subject capitol and its subsidiary banks to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose capitol to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on capitol s results of operations 
item a 
risk factors continued 
the banks allowances for loan losses may prove inadequate to absorb actual loan losses  which may adversely impact net income or increase operating losses 
capitol believes that its consolidated allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolios at the balance sheet date 
management s estimates are used to determine the allowance and are based on historical loss experience  specific problem loans  value of underlying collateral and other relevant factors 
these estimates are subjective and their accuracy depends on the outcome of future events 
actual future losses may differ from current estimates 
depending on changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates that are generally beyond capitol s control  actual loan losses could increase significantly 
as a result  such losses could exceed current allowance estimates 
no assurance can be provided that the allowance will be sufficient to cover actual future loan losses should such losses be realized 
loan loss experience  which is helpful in estimating the requirements for the allowance for loan losses at any given balance sheet date  has been minimal at many of capitol s banks 
because many of capitol s banks are young  they do not have seasoned loan portfolios  and it is likely that the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans may need to be increased in future periods as the loan portfolios become more mature and loss experience evolves 
if it becomes necessary to increase the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans  such increases would be accomplished through higher provisions for loan losses  which may adversely impact net income or increase operating losses 
widespread media reports of concerns about the health of the domestic economy have continued in capitol s loan losses in recent years have varied 
further  amounts of nonperforming loans have fluctuated and it is anticipated that levels of nonperforming loans and related loan losses may increase as economic conditions  locally and nationally  evolve 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their supervisory functions  periodically review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
regulatory agencies may require capitol or its banks to increase their provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge offs based upon judgments different from those of management 
any increase in the allowance required by regulatory agencies could have a negative impact on capitol s operating results 
capitol could face unanticipated environmental liabilities or costs related to real property owned or acquired through foreclosure 
compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those related to investigation and clean up of contaminated sites  could have a negative effect on expenses and results of operations 
a significant portion of capitol s affiliate bank s loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  capitol s affiliate banks may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  capitol s affiliate banks may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require capitol s affiliate banks to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit capitol s affiliate bank s ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase capitol s affiliate bank s exposure to environmental liability 
although capitol s affiliate banks have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
item a 
risk factors continued 
capitol s commercial loan concentration to small businesses and collateralized by commercial real estate increases the risk of defaults by borrowers and substantial credit losses could result  causing shareholders to lose their investment in capitol s common stock 
capitol s banks make various types of loans  including commercial  consumer  residential mortgage and construction loans 
capitol s strategy emphasizes lending to small businesses and other commercial enterprises 
capitol typically uses commercial real estate as a source of collateral for many of its loans 
recently  regulatory agencies have expressed concern with banks with large concentrations in commercial real estate due to the recent downturn in the real estate market in certain areas of the country possibly leading to increased risk of credit loss and extended periods of sale 
loans to small and medium sized businesses are generally riskier than single family mortgage loans 
typically  the success of a small or medium sized business depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons  and the death  disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business 
in addition  small and medium sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition  may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial variations in operating results  any of which may impair a borrower s ability to repay a loan 
substantial credit losses could result  causing shareholders to lose their entire investment in capitol s common stock 
actions by the open market committee of the federal reserve board frbomc may adversely affect capitol s net interest income 
changes in net interest income 
capitol s profitability is significantly dependent on net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
therefore  any change in general market interest rates  whether as a result of changes in monetary policies of the federal reserve board or otherwise  can have a significant effect on net interest income 
capitol s assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristic of assets and liabilities 
as a result  changes in interest rates can affect net interest income in either a positive or negative way 
recently  the federal reserve has increased interest rates several times 
future stability of interest rates and federal reserve open market committee policy  which impact such rates  are uncertain 
changes in the yield curve 
changes in the difference between short and long term interest rates  commonly known as the yield curve  may also harm capitol s business 
for example  short term deposits may be used to fund longer term loans 
when differences between short term and long term interest rates shrink or disappear  the spread between rates paid on deposits and received on loans could narrow significantly  decreasing net interest income 
existing subsidiaries of capitol may need additional funds to aid in their growth or to meet other anticipated needs which could reduce capitol s funds available for new bank development or other corporate purposes 
future growth of existing banks may require additional capital infusions or other investment by capitol to maintain compliance with regulatory capital requirements or to meet growth opportunities 
such capital infusions could reduce funds available for development of new banks or other corporate purposes 
item a 
risk factors continued 
capitol has debt securities outstanding which may prohibit future cash dividends on capitol s common stock or otherwise adversely affect regulatory capital compliance 
capitol has a credit facility with an unaffiliated bank under which borrowings of up to million are permitted  subject to certain conditions 
capitol is reliant upon its bank subsidiaries earnings and dividends to service this debt obligation which may be inadequate to service the obligations  in the event capitol utilizes this facility 
in the event of violation of the covenants relating to the credit facility  or due to failure to make timely payments of interest and debt principal  the lender may terminate the credit facility 
in addition  upon such occurrences  dividends on capitol s common stock may be prohibited or capitol may be otherwise unable to make future dividends payments or obtain replacement credit facilities 
capitol also has several series of trust preferred securities outstanding  with a liquidation amount totaling about million  which are treated as capital for regulatory ratio compliance purposes 
although these securities are viewed as capital for regulatory purposes  they are debt securities which have numerous covenants and other provisions which  in the event of noncompliance  could have an adverse effect on capitol 
for example  these securities permit capitol to defer the periodic payment of interest for various periods  however  if such payments are deferred  capitol is prohibited from paying cash dividends on its common stock during deferral periods and until deferred interest is paid 
future payment of interest is dependent upon capitol s bank subsidiaries earnings and dividends which may be inadequate to service the obligations 
continued classification of these securities as elements of capital for regulatory purposes is subject to future changes in regulatory rules and regulations and the actions of regulatory agencies  all of which is beyond the control or influence of capitol 
capitol s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented which could have a material adverse effect on capitol s business  results of operations and financial condition 
capitol regularly reviews and updates its internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on capitol s business  results of operations and financial condition 
capitol s bylaws as well as certain banking laws may have an anti takeover effect 
provisions of capitol s bylaws  the michigan control share act  and certain federal banking laws  including regulatory approval requirements  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire capitol  even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to shareholders 
the combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non negotiated merger or other business combination  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of capitol s common stock 
capitol s bank subsidiaries have decentralized management which could have a negative impact on the rate of growth and profitability of capitol and its bank subsidiaries 
capitol s bank subsidiaries have independent boards of directors and management teams 
this decentralized structure gives the banks control over the day to day management of the institution  including credit decisions  the selection of personnel  the pricing of loans and deposits  marketing decisions and the strategy in handling problem loans 
this decentralized structure may impact capitol s ability to uniformly implement corporate or enterprise wide strategy at the bank level 
it may slow capitol s ability to react to changes in strategic direction due to outside factors such as interest rate changes and changing economic conditions 
this decentralized structure may cause additional management time to be spent on internal issues and could negatively impact the growth and profitability of the banks individually and the parent company
