item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except share and per share data restatement subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements  we determined that the common stock purchase warrants that were issued as part of our equity finance transactions in october  april and august  respectively  and which were accounted for in stockholders equity at their relative fair value upon issuance  should have been accounted for as derivative liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the warrants did not meet any of the scope exceptions allowed by sfas specifically  the warrants did not meet the criteria in paragraph a of sfas that a contract should not be considered a derivative instrument if it is indexed to its own stock and classified in stockholders equity 
the warrants  when classified as derivative liabilities  are required to be initially recorded at fair value and to be marked to fair value at the end of each reporting period  which results in a non cash charge or credit to other income and expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and have been restated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the restatement described above 
recent event on march   we issued approximately million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share to discharge approximately million of the remaining million then outstanding obligations under our convertible debentures that we sold in february the exercise price of the common stock warrants issued in february to the same investors was reduced to and the number of shares issuable on exercise proportionately increased to take into account the dilutive effect of this transaction 
if all the warrants were exercised by cash payment  we would issue approximately million new shares 
we also agreed that we will not make payments on the remaining debenture obligations in shares unless the price of our common stock is at least  for months after this transaction we will not offer or sell our securities without also offering them to the former debenture holders  and we will not offer or sell our securities before april  at an effective price per share of our common stock lower than 
overview we are a development stage company engaged in research and development of carbohydrate based therapeutic compounds 
we believe our carbohydrate based compounds offer numerous opportunities to provide advanced disease treatments 
our initial focus is on the target delivery of chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of cancer 
we believe our initial carbohydrate compound davanat may reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and increase their efficacy by targeting delivery directly to cancerous cells  thereby creating a preferable treatment to existing oncology regimens 
for additional information  please see item business business of pro pharmaceuticals 
all of our drug candidates are currently in preclinical and clinical development 
we currently have only one drug candidate davanat in clinical development 
in general  in order to commercialize our current and 
table of contents future drug candidates  we are required to successfully complete preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals 
current requirements for regulatory approval include preclinical toxicology  pharmacology and metabolism studies  as well as in vivo efficacy studies in relevant animal models of disease  manufacturing of drug product for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supply  submission of the results of preclinical studies and information regarding manufacturing and control and proposed clinical protocol to the us food and drug administration fda in an investigational new drug application ind  or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states  conduct of clinical trials designed to provide data and information regarding the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in humans  and submission of all the results of testing to the fda in a new drug application nda  or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states 
upon approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities we may commence commercial marketing and distribution of the product 
this process typically takes several years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals will materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from commercial sales relating to our drug candidates 
we may file an nda for a drug candidate in we anticipate our source of funding for the next several years to come from either financing transactions or collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies 
we are devoting substantially all of our efforts toward product research and development  and raising capital 
we have no source of revenue and have incurred significant losses to date 
we have incurred net losses of  for the cumulative period from inception july  through december  our losses have resulted principally from costs associated with research and development expenses  including clinical trial costs  and general and administrative activities 
as a result of planned expenditures for future research  discovery  development and commercialization activities  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we have raised  in capital principally through the issuance of convertible notes  the sale of common stock through a public offering and the sale of common stock and warrants through private placements as of december  from inception july  through december   we used cash of  for our operations 
at december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents and certificate of deposit available to fund future operations  which we believe is sufficient to fund our operations through at least june because we lack revenue and must continue our research and development  we must continually identify new sources of capital and complete financing transactions in order to continue our business 
we must continually monitor the monthly burn rate of our capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies  however  are critical to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  which subjects them to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying our accounting policies  our management uses its best judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information available from other outside sources  and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
we believe that the critical 
table of contents accounting policies discussed below involve more complex management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that third parties have performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include contract service fees in conjunction with pre clinical and clinical trials  professional service fees  such as those arising from the services of attorneys and accountants and accrued payroll expenses 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual services incurred by the service providers 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services or costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be understated or overstated 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of services are often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
convertible debt instrument 
our convertible debt instrument issued in the debentures constitutes a hybrid instrument that has the characteristics of a debt host contract containing several embedded derivative features that would require bifurcation and separate accounting as a derivative instrument pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  we irrevocably elected to initially and subsequently measure the debentures in their entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as either a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations under the caption change in fair value of convertible debt instrument 
fair value of the debentures is determined using a binomial financial valuation model that requires assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment such as volatility of our common share price  interest rates and our intention to redeem the debentures in cash or common shares 
volatility and interest rate expectations are based on the remaining year to maturity of the debentures 
warrants 
we have issued common stock warrants in connection with the execution of certain equity and debt financings and consulting agreements 
certain warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities at fair value in accordance with sfas such warrants do not meet the criteria in paragraph a of sfas that a contract should not be considered a derivative instrument if it is indexed to its own stock and classified in stockholders equity 
changes in fair value of derivative liabilities are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations under the caption change in fair value of warrant liabilities 
warrants that are not considered derivative liabilities as defined in sfas are accounted for at fair value at the date of issuance in additional paid in capital 
the fair value of warrants without probability conditions is determined using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions regarding volatility of our common share price  expected life of the warrant  and risk free interest rates at each period end 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
at this time our primary deferred tax asset relates to our net operating loss carryforwards 
in the determination of the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  there is the 
table of contents possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations 
stock based compensation 
through december   we accounted for stock based compensation to employees and non employee directors under the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
and the related interpretations 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recognized for stock options granted to employees at fair market value and with fixed terms 
on january   we adopted sfas r  accounting for share based payment  sfas r using the modified prospective method  which results in the provisions of sfas r being applied to the consolidated financial statements on a going forward basis 
prior periods have not been restated 
sfas r requires companies to recognize stock based compensation awards granted to its employees as compensation expense on a fair value method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the grant date fair value of stock options is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited 
previously  we recorded the impact of forfeitures as they occurred 
we do not anticipate any awards will be forfeited in our calculation of compensation expense due to the limited number of employees that receive stock option grants and our historical employee turnover 
we consider equity compensation to be an important component in attracting and retaining key employees 
during  and  we awarded approximately   and  stock options  respectively  to employees  consultants and non employee members of our board of directors for normal services and we recorded of related stock option expense in because the exercise price of the options granted equal the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant and the options have fixed terms  we recorded no stock compensation expense on these awards in and if we had used the fair value method provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  our net loss in and respectively of  and  would have increased by and to  and  respectively 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared to  incurred during the year ended december  we generally categorize research and development expenses as either direct external expense  comprised of amounts paid to third party vendors for services  or all other expenses  comprised of employee payroll and general overhead allocable to research and development 
we subdivide external expenses between clinical programs and preclinical activities 
we consider a clinical program to have begun upon acceptance by the fda  or similar agency outside of the united states  to commence a clinical trial in humans  at which time we begin tracking expenditures by the product candidate 
we have one product candidate davanat in clinical trials at this time 
clinical program expenses comprise payments to vendors related to preparation for  and conduct of  all phases of the clinical trial  including costs for drug manufacture  patient dosing and monitoring  data collection and management  oversight of the trials and reports of results 
pre clinical expenses comprise all research and development amounts incurred before human trials begin  including payments to vendors for services related to product experiments and discovery  toxicology  pharmacology  metabolism and efficacy studies  as well as manufacturing process development for a drug candidate 

table of contents our research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  were as follows year ended december  direct external expenses clinical programs pre clinical activities all other research and development expenses clinical trial expense decreased by as the phase i late stage cancer patient trial was completed and the phase ii late stage colorectal cancer patient trial completed dosing resulting in reduced spending that was offset by the initiation of the line i biliary duct cancer  the line i colorectal cancer and line ii colorectal cancer trials 
pre clinical spending decreased due principally to reduced davanat manufacturing costs 
all other research and development costs increased due to the addition of our chief scientist  additional personnel to support our clinical trials and expensing stock based compensation largely related to the fair value method as required by sfas r 
in summary  research and development expense in shifted from pre clinical activities to clinical programs 
the increase in clinical trial expense was due to the start up and costs associated with the phase ii trial 
we completed dosing patients in a phase i clinical trial of davanat in march of and began dosing patients in a phase ii clinical trial of davanat in may of while the pre clinical tests and experiments associated with davanat diminished in as compared to we expect our research and development expenses will increase moderately in due to the new line i phase ii clinical trials and a modest increase in overhead expenses 
both the time required and costs we may incur in order to commercialize a drug candidate that would result in material net cash inflow are subject to numerous variables  and hence we are unable at this stage of our development to forecast useful estimates 
variables that make estimates difficult include the number of clinical trials we may undertake  the number of patients needed to participate in the clinical trial  patient recruitment uncertainties  trial results as to the safety and efficacy of our product  and uncertainties as to the regulatory agency response to our trial data prior to receipt of marketing approval 
moreover  the fda or other regulatory agencies may suspend clinical trials if we or an agency believes patients in the trial are subject to unacceptable risks  or find deficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trial 
delays or rejections may also occur if governmental regulation or policy changes during our clinical trials or in the course of review of our clinical data 
please see risks related to pro pharmaceuticals and risks related to the drug development industry for additional risks and other factors that make estimates difficult at this time 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of costs and completion of our program and the period during which material net cash inflows will commence are unavailable at this time 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  in or an increase of  as compared to  in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  including stock based compensation  legal and accounting fees  insurance  investor relations  business development and other office related costs 
of the increase in expense in  approximately consisted of an increase in accounting and other costs associated primarily with the convertible debentures 
approximately of the increase was due to expensing stock based compensation related to the fair value method as required by sfas r 
these increases were offset by a reduction in legal expense of approximately legal expenses decreased due to lower expenses associated with the intellectual property litigation with glycogenesys 
payroll expense increased due to the addition of our chief scientist and other personnel which was more than offset by lower incentive compensation payments 

table of contents we expect general and administrative expenses in to be approximately the same as other income and expense 
other income and expense was income of  in as compared to expense of in of the  increase   is related to fair value accounting for warrant liabilities 
this was offset by  of charges related to our convertible debt instrument of which  is related to fair value accounting and  is interest expense 
the  of interest includes  of debt discount amortization and of interest expense 
additionally  interest income in was approximately or an increase of as compared to in interest income consists primarily of interest income on interest bearing cash equivalents and the certificate of deposit 
the increase in interest income is due primarily to higher average interest rates and to a lesser degree due to higher average cash balances 
average interest rates were approximately per annum in versus approximately per annum in fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared to  incurred during the year ended december  our research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  were as follows year ended december  direct external expenses clinical programs pre clinical activities all other research and development expenses in summary  research and development expense in shifted from pre clinical activities to clinical programs 
the increase in clinical trial expense was due to the start up and costs associated with the phase ii trial 
we completed dosing patients in a phase i clinical trial of davanat in march of and began dosing patients in a phase ii clinical trial of davanat in may of while the pre clinical tests and experiments associated with davanat diminished in as compared to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  in or a decrease of  as compared to  in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  including stock based compensation  legal and accounting fees  insurance  investor relations  business development and other office related costs 
the reduction in expense in  consisted of a reduction in legal expense of approximately this was offset by an increase in payroll of approximately and a decrease in all other spending of approximately of the decrease in legal expenses approximately was due to the patent arbitration between dr 
platt  our ceo and glycogenesys which was conducted and completed in the arbitration concerned the rights to control prosecution of patent applications that dr 
platt licensed to glycogenesys 
in november  the arbitrator awarded the patent prosecution rights to dr 
platt 
the remainder of the decrease in legal expenses as compared to was related to expenses incurred in to defend a lawsuit asserted by a former employee 
this matter was concluded in these expense decreases were offset in part by an increase of approximately associated with legal expenses to defend the counterclaim lawsuit filed by glycogenesys against us and dr 
platt as described in item legal proceedings above 
interest and other income 
other income and expense in was an expense of as compared to income of  in of the  decrease   was related to fair value accounting associated with 
table of contents warrant liabilities 
additionally interest income decreased by interest income consists primarily of interest income on interest bearing cash equivalents 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower average cash balances partially offset by higher average interest rates 
average interest rates were approximately per annum in versus approximately per annum in liquidity and capital resources in thousands as described in the section entitled overview above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we are in the development stage and have not generated any revenues to date 
since our inception on july   we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of convertible debt  shares of common stock and warrants  and a public offering of shares of common stock 
at december   we had raised a total of  from these offerings and had  of cash and certificate of deposit available 
on february  we raised million resulting in net proceeds after transaction costs of approximately million by issuing convertible debentures and common stock warrants through a private placement 
the convertible debentures and related interest may be repaid in common stock subject to certain provisions 
the details of this transaction are more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in operations was  in and  in the increased use of cash in operations in as compared to was primarily due to increased working capital needs 
we expect our cash needs in to remain at approximately the same level as net cash used in investing activities was approximately  in as compared to approximately in the increase in as compared to was due to increased capital expenditures associated primarily with the move of our corporate offices to new leased space and a  investment in a certificate of deposit 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in  and in net cash provided by financing activities in resulted from the sale of the convertible debentures and common stock warrants 
in  we elected to make two payments  amounting to  of principal in cash 
on march  we discharged approximately million of our million of obligations then outstanding under the convertible debentures 
see recent event above in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that our cash on hand and certificate of deposit of  at december  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our financing and operating obligations through at least june we will require more cash to fund our operations and believe that we will be able to obtain additional financing 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such new financing or  if available  that such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
payments due under contractual obligations in thousands the following table summarizes the payments due under our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years convertible debt instrument operating leases total payments due under contractual obligations 
table of contents long term debt consists of scheduled principal and interest payments on our convertible debentures 
remaining principal of  is payable in monthly installments through january  november  if repaid in shares 
interest accrues at the rate of and is payable monthly 
remaining interest due is and is all due in less than one year 
principal and interest may be paid  at our option  in cash or shares of our common stock 
because investors may convert principal into common stock  at any time  at their option  the timing of principal and interest payments may accelerate relative to this schedule 
on march  we discharged approximately million of the million then outstanding under our convertible debentures 
see recent events  above under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
on may  we entered into an operating lease for office space 
the lease commenced on august  and extends for five years and terminates on september  the lease provides for annual base rental payments of in the first year increasing in each subsequent lease year to   and respectively 
in addition to base rental payments included in the contractual obligations table above  we are responsible for our pro rata share of increases in the operating expenses for the building after calendar year and taxes for the building after fiscal year we have the option to extend the term of the lease for an additional five year period at the prevailing market rate at the time of exercise 
in connection with this new office space lease  a commercial bank has issued a letter of credit collateralized by cash we have on deposit with the bank of approximately additionally  we have a non cancellable lease for a car which expires in october of we have engaged outside vendors for certain services associated with our clinical trials 
these services are generally available from several providers and  accordingly  our arrangements are typically cancellable on days notice 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not a party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in the us interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve cash until it is required to fund operations 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents in operating bank accounts and money market funds 
since our investments are short term in duration  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
as of december  we had  of principal outstanding on the convertible debentures with an interest rate fixed at 
we account for the convertible debentures at fair value  and changes in our share price and market interest rates will affect our earnings but will not affect our cash flows
