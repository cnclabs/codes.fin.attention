item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
under the percentage of completion accounting method  we record revenue as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date bear to total estimated costs 
accordingly  contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised monthly as the work progresses 
adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the period when such estimates are revised 
estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and experience  but are only estimates 
variation of actual results from assumptions on an unusually large project or on a number of average size projects could be material 
we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on a contract when estimates indicate such a loss 
such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability which could negatively impact our cash flow from operations 
certain provisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of us  or a substantial interest in us  more difficult 
the following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as currently in effect  as well as our stockholder rights plan and delaware law  could discourage potential proposals to acquire us  delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock o our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws  o our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of our stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings  o our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent  o we are subject to provisions of delaware law which prohibit us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such stockholder becomes classified as an interested stockholder  and o we adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors or permitted by our stockholder rights plan

we provide services to a broad range of commercial  industrial  utility and institutional customers through approximately principal operating subsidiaries and joint venture entities 
our offices are located throughout the united states  in canada and in the united kingdom 
in the united arab emirates  we carry on business through two joint ventures 
overview the following table presents selected financial data for the fiscal years ended december   and in millions  except percentages and earnings per share caption 
del revenues  revenues increase from prior year operating income operating income as a percentage of revenues net income diluted earnings per share cash flows provided by operating activities del 
our results of operations for benefited from a strong commercial construction business cycle and a greater availability of generally higher gross margin work in the united states than was the case in all of our operating segments reported positive operating income for for the first time since  exclusive of our other international construction and facilities services segment that consisted of two small joint ventures in the middle east during this time period 
in particular  the commercial  hospitality  high tech  food and pharmaceutical sectors contributed to the general improvement in our united states construction profits 
our united states facilities services segment benefited from the addition of new site based facilities services contracts and strong demand for mobile services 
our united states mechanical construction and facilities services segment also benefited from the absence of an million non cash expense recorded in with respect to a civil action 
included in net income from continuing operations were favorable income tax adjustments of million and million for and  respectively 
the general market improvements in results for were partially offset by fewer transportation infrastructure and financial services projects  which had produced higher operating margins in than in and had increased the reported operating income as a percentage of revenues for  and by larger than usual losses on certain contracts particularly within the united states electrical construction and facilities services segment 
additionally  our results  when compared to  were negatively impacted by the absence of a million favorable insurance settlement  which primarily affected the united states electrical construction and facilities services segment 
results also were negatively impacted by a million expense  or per basic and diluted share after income tax  relating to the effect of the adoption of statement no 
r share based payment statement r issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million for  compared to million for our year ending cash and cash equivalents balance was million compared to million at the end of this improvement was primarily attributable to improved billing and collection practices and settlement of certain large contract claims and disputes 
we continued to restructure parts of our business during resulting in million of restructuring expense  which was primarily related to the reduction of personnel and leased facilities in our united states facilities services segment 
our net income and diluted earnings per share for compared to were positively impacted by a generally improved performance on united states and united kingdom construction contracts  b greater availability of generally higher margin discretionary project work in the united states and united kingdom  c favorable income tax adjustments of million  d the settlement of an insurance coverage related dispute which contributed approximately million to operating income  e a generally improved economic environment  particularly for the united states and united kingdom commercial construction industry  and f reduced losses in our canada construction and facilities services segment 
the favorable income tax adjustments of million were comprised of a reversal of million in income tax reserves that were no longer required  partially offset by a million income tax provision related to a valuation allowance recorded to reduce deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences of our canada construction and facilities services segment 
the valuation allowance was required because of uncertainty at the time if the segment would have sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the income tax benefit of such deferred tax assets 
the results also included favorable income tax adjustments of million see discussion below 
results for were negatively impacted by a non cash expense of million as a result of the uosa action 
we have share based compensation plans and programs 
with the adoption of statement r on january   all share based payments to our employees and non employee directors  including grants of stock options  have been recognized in the income statement based on their fair values utilizing the modified prospective method of accounting 
the impact of the adoption of statement r resulted in the recognition of million of compensation expense in as a result  on an after income tax basis  net income was adversely impacted by million  and basic and diluted earnings per share was adversely impacted by 
approximately million of compensation expense  net of income taxes  will be recognized over the approximate month remaining vesting period for stock options outstanding at december  prior to january   we applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion and related interpretations in accounting for stock options 
accordingly  no compensation expense had been recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for and as permitted by opinion in respect of stock options vesting during those periods inasmuch as we granted stock options at fair market value 
compensation awards for which the liabilities fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock increased incentive based compensation expense by million for compared to a civil action the uosa action was brought by a joint venture the jv between our subsidiary poole and kent corporation poole kent and an unrelated company against the upper occoquan sewage authority uosa  based on a material breach by uosa of a construction contract 
as a result of a jury decision on march  and subsequent rulings of the trial judge in the action  it was determined that the jv is entitled to be paid approximately million in connection with the uosa project in addition to the amounts it has already received from uosa 
uosa has paid approximately million of the million  but is seeking to have a determination of the trial court reversed on appeal to the virginia supreme court regarding its obligation to pay the balance 
there is no assurance that the virginia supreme court will hear the appeal or  if the appeal is heard  that it will be resolved in favor of the jv 
inasmuch as the jury decision and the trial judge s subsequent ruling did not reflect the amount sought by the jv following the trial we recorded a non cash expense of approximately million during the first quarter of following the jury decision on march  and an additional non cash expense of approximately million during the second quarter of following a ruling by the trial judge on june  these non cash expenses reflected a write off of unrecovered costs of poole kent in completing certain work related to this project based on what we believe is probable of recovery by the jv based on current facts 
the unrecoverable costs were included in the balance sheet account costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the jv has asserted additional claims against uosa relating to the same project which are also pending in the fairfax  virginia circuit court and another trial between the jv and uosa is scheduled to commence in september in which the jv seeks damages in excess of million 
upon the resolution of the additional claims referred to in the immediately preceding sentence  we may record income or additional non cash expense 
in accordance with the agreement establishing the jv  poole kent is entitled to approximately one half of the aggregate amounts paid and to be paid by uosa to the jv

other international construction and facilities services represents our operations outside of the united states  canada and the united kingdom currently in the middle east 
in august of  we sold our interest in a south african joint venture 
discussion and analysis of results of operations our reportable segments reflect  for all years presented  discontinued operations accounting due to the sale of one subsidiary in and one in and certain reclassifications of prior years amounts among the segments due to changes in our internal reporting structure 
revenues as described in more detail below  revenues for were billion compared to billion for and the increased revenue for compared to was primarily attributable to a strong commercial construction business cycle and to increased work for the hospitality  high tech  food and pharmaceutical sectors 
although our total revenues in and were approximately the same  revenues when compared to were positively impacted by increased private sector commercial construction and discretionary project work  offset by planned curtailment of work on certain types of public sector and certain other longer term projects by certain of our subsidiaries 
as of december   our backlog was billion  an all time high  and as of december   backlog was billion 
this increase was primarily attributable to the strong united states commercial and hospitality construction market and continued sales efforts that have resulted in additional site based service contracts for our united states facilities services segment 
backlog is not a term recognized under united states generally accepted accounting principles  however  it is a common measurement used in our industry 
backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of facilities services contracts 
however  if the remaining term of a facilities services contract exceeds months  the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in backlog are limited to only months of revenues

revenues of our united states electrical construction and facilities services segment for increased million compared to the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased commercial work as a result of a stronger commercial construction market and greater availability of government project work 
revenues for decreased million compared to this decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to reduced transportation infrastructure construction work and construction work for financial services firms  partially offset by increased commercial construction and discretionary project work generally due to the greater availability of such work 
revenues of our united states mechanical construction and facilities services segment for increased million compared to the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased commercial work as a result of an overall stronger commercial construction market  including greater availability of work in the hospitality  high tech  food and pharmaceutical sectors 
revenues for decreased million compared to the revenues decrease was primarily attributable to a planned decrease in activities of certain subsidiaries related to the reduction in bidding for certain types of public sector projects and certain other long term projects  partially offset by increased water and wastewater treatment and hospitality projects undertaken by certain of our subsidiaries and increased discretionary project work 
the increase in discretionary project work was partially attributable to seasonably warm weather conditions in compared to unseasonably cool weather conditions in united states facilities services revenues  which include those operations that principally provide maintenance and consulting services  increased million in compared to this increase was primarily related to an increased number of site based services contracts  the addition of a mobile services company acquired in november  that accounted for million of this increase in revenues in  and greater demand in for mobile services work 
the site based revenues increase was related to an increase in the outsourcing of facilities services work  augmented by our own efforts to pursue opportunities in the government and commercial sectors 
the increase in demand for mobile services was primarily due to the strong commercial construction business cycle which resulted in an increase in our small project work  and increased demand for maintenance caused by energy cost awareness

our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance increased by approximately million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for compared to was primarily due to an increase in working capital as a result of an increase in net over billings related to improved billing and collection practices and settlement of certain large contract claims and disputes

cash payments for insurance related liabilities may be payable beyond three years  but it is not practical to estimate 
we classify these borrowings as short term on our consolidated balance sheet because of our intent and ability to repay the amounts on a short term basis 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding 
our previous revolving credit agreement the old revolving credit facility made as of september   as amended  provided for a credit facility of million 
effective october   we replaced the old revolving credit facility with an amended and restated million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility expires on october  it permits us to increase our borrowing to million if additional lenders are identified and or existing lenders are willing to increase their current commitments 
we utilized this feature to increase the line of credit under the revolving credit facility from million to million on november  we may allocate up to million of the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries  is secured by substantially all of our assets and most of the assets of our subsidiaries  and provides for borrowings in the form of revolving loans and letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility contains various covenants requiring  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain restrictions with respect to payment of dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness and capital expenditures 
a commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
the fee ranges from to of the unused amount  based on certain financial tests 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by harris nesbitt from time to time at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests or united states dollar libor at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests 
the interest rates in effect at december  were and for the prime commercial lending rate and the united states dollar libor  respectively 
letter of credit fees issued under this facility range from to of the respective face amounts of the letters of credit issued and are charged based on the type of letter of credit issued and certain financial tests 
in connection with the replacement of the old revolving credit facility  million of prepaid commitment fees were recorded as interest expense for as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december  and our canadian subsidiary  comstock canada ltd  has a credit agreement with a bank providing for an overdraft facility of up to cdn 
million 
the facility is secured by a standby letter of credit and provides for interest at the bank s prime rate  which was at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement at december  or one of our subsidiaries has guaranteed million of borrowings of a venture in which we have a interest  the other venture partner  baltimore gas and electric a subsidiary of constellation energy  has a interest 
the venture designs  constructs  owns  operates  leases and maintains facilities to produce chilled water for sale to customers for use in air conditioning commercial properties 
these guarantees are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we and baltimore gas and electric are jointly and severally liable  in the event of default  for the venture s million in borrowings 
the terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies surety companies and provide to our customers payment and performance bonds surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts 
the surety bonds secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts  and we have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts  if any  paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf 
in addition  at the request of labor unions representing certain of our employees  surety bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees 
public sector contracts require surety bonds more frequently than private sector contracts  and accordingly  our bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of public sector work increases 
as of december   based on our percentage of completion of our projects covered by surety bonds  our aggregate estimated exposure  had there been defaults on all our existing contractual obligations  would have been approximately billion 
the surety bonds are issued by surety companies in return for premiums  which vary depending on the size and type of bond 
in recent years there has been a reduction in the aggregate surety bond issuance capacity of surety companies due to industry consolidations and significant losses of surety companies as a result of providing surety bonds to construction companies as well as companies in other industries 
consequently  the availability of surety bonds has become more limited and the terms upon which surety bonds are available have become more restrictive 
if we experience changes in our bonding relationships or if there are further changes in the surety industry  we may seek to satisfy certain customer requests for surety bonds by posting other forms of collateral in lieu of surety bonds such as letters of credit or guarantees by emcor group  inc  by seeking to convince customers to forego the requirement of a surety bond  by increasing our activities in business segments that rarely require surety bonds such as the facilities services segment and or by refraining from bidding for certain projects that require surety bonds 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectuate alternatives to providing surety bonds to our customers or to obtain  on favorable terms  sufficient additional work that does not require surety bonds to replace projects requiring surety bonds that we may decline to pursue 
accordingly  if we were to experience a reduction in the availability of surety bonds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flow 
we do not have any other material financial guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed herein 
our primary source of liquidity has been  and is expected to continue to be  cash generated by operating activities 
we also maintain the revolving credit facility that may be utilized  among other things  to meet short term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient or to enable us to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason 
we may also increase liquidity through an equity offering or issuance of other debt instruments 
short term changes in macroeconomic trends may have an affect  positively or negatively  on liquidity 
in addition to managing borrowings  our focus on the facilities services market is intended to provide an additional buffer against economic downturns inasmuch as the facilities services business is characterized by annual and multi year contracts that provide a more predictable stream of cash flow than the construction business 
short term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place 
during economic downturns  such as the downturn that we experienced from through in the commercial construction industry  there were typically fewer small discretionary projects from the private sector  and companies like us aggressively bid more large long term infrastructure and public sector contracts 
performance of long duration contracts typically requires working capital until initial billing milestones are achieved 
while we strive to maintain a net over billed position with our customers  there can be no assurance that a net over billed position can be maintained 
our net over billings  defined as the balance sheet accounts billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts less cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
long term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met through cash generated from operating activities  the revolving credit facility and the sale of various secured or unsecured debt and or equity interests in the public and private markets 
based upon our current credit ratings and financial position  we can reasonably expect to be able to issue long term debt instruments and or equity 
over the long term  our primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non residential construction services  which is in turn influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy 
in addition to the primary revenue risk factor  our ability to perform work at profitable levels is critical to meeting long term liquidity requirements 
we believe that current cash balances and borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility or other forms of financing available through debt or equity offerings  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide short term and foreseeable long term liquidity and meet expected capital expenditure requirements 
however  we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from us amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to over million 
if we were required to pay damages in one or more such proceedings  such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
certain insurance matters as of december   we utilized approximately million of letters of credit issued pursuant to our revolving credit facility as collateral for insurance obligations
