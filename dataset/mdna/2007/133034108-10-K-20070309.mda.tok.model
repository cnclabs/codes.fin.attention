executive overview net income for of million decreased million  or  from net income of million reported in net income per diluted share was  a increase over the reported for  which reflects the favorable impact of the dutch auction tender offer stock repurchase completed in the second quarter of the following were significant factors related to the results of fiscal year compared to fiscal year net interest income decreased  or  which was primarily a function of the flattening of the yield curve  which drove up deposit and borrowing costs more significantly than income on earning assets  and the addition of the interest cost on the trust preferred securities issued during as a result  the net interest margin was in compared to in the provision for loan and lease losses of million increased  in over as a result of million in loan growth  an increase in non performing loans as a percentage of total loans  and an increase in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding 
non interest income increased  or million  primarily due to an increase in income from fiduciary services at acadia trust  na  an increase in debit card income  and a loss on the sale of investments 
non interest expenses increased  or million  primarily due to a charge of  related to the steamship navigation et al litigation involving cnb   in expenses incurred as part of the merger of our two banks  and increased risk management related expenses including legal and collection costs  all of which were partially offset by decreased employee compensation costs as we did not pay a general incentive bonus for and reduced our benefit costs 
total assets at december  increased as investments and loans were up and  respectively  over total liabilities at december  increased as borrowings and deposit balances were up and  respectively  over the same period a year earlier 
shareholders equity decreased due to share buybacks  partially offset by current year earnings 
results of operations comparison of to we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for compared to million and per diluted share in return on average assets was in  compared to in and return on average shareholders equity was in  compared to in the decrease in return on average assets was primarily a result of an environment of increasing interest rates and a flattening yield curve 
this environment resulted in longer duration earning assets loans and investments booked during to experience less of an increase in yields compared to the increase in funding costs  thus we did not produce the same level of net interest spread yield on earning assets less cost on associated funding liabilities compared to the prior year 
the return on average assets was also negatively affected by the introduction of the recurring interest cost of the trust preferred security issuance 
the increase in the return on average equity was primarily due to the repurchase of  shares of common stock during  most of which were purchased as part of the second quarter dutch auction tender offer

table of contents net interest income net interest income accounted for of total revenues  and is our largest source of revenue 
net interest income reflects revenues generated through income from earning assets plus loan fees  less interest paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income was million on a fully taxable equivalent basis in  compared to million in  a decrease of  our level of net interest income fluctuates over time for three primary reasons interest earned from earning assets and expenses from interest bearing deposits and borrowings fluctuate due to changes in interest rates 
this is referred to as the yield or rate component of net interest income 
net interest income changes due to the amount of earning assets we maintain  as well as the amount of non interest bearing deposits  interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
this is referred to as the volume component of net interest income 
net interest income fluctuates as a result of the change  over time  in the components of earning assets  non interest bearing deposits  interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
this is referred to as the mix component of net interest income 
it is our goal to maximize net interest income by providing competitive products to customers that  within various risk parameters  maximize interest income while minimizing interest expense 
we use several analytical models  including those illustrated by tables on pages and below  to assess and monitor those factors that affect net interest income  to assess our performance in meeting our goals  and to determine future strategies 
impact of rates 
during  interest rates continued to increase with four quarter percentage point increases in the federal funds discount rate fed funds rate  which followed eight quarter percentage point increases in  and culminated at at december  during  the earnings on our interest bearing assets  which contractually re price subject to caps based on various benchmarks  such as the prime rate and the london inter bank offer rate libor these products are also referred to as variable or floating rate instruments  increased in response to the changes in the underlying benchmark rates resulting in an overall increase in yields 
interest income on securities was positively impacted during as a result of new investments being added to the portfolio at higher yields than maturing investments 
for our interest bearing liabilities  the higher rate environment during had a negative impact as maturing deposit products and term borrowings re priced upward upon maturity 
as a result of the rate increases and the highly competitive environment in which we compete  we raised the rates paid on certain deposit products  primarily certificates of deposit and money market accounts  as competitors also raised rates paid on such products 
in addition  in  we were negatively impacted million due to increases in short term borrowing rates  which were primarily overnight funds from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb  million due to increases in brokered certificate of deposit rates  and million due to the interest paid on the trust preferred issuance 
overall  during compared to  our net interest income was adversely impacted million due to rate changes  with increased earning asset yields contributing million  while increased funding costs decreased net interest income million 
impact of volume 
during  loan volume increases contributed million to net interest income as residential mortgages increased million  or  commercial loan balances increased million  or  and consumer loans including home equities increased million  or 
the significant increase in new residential loans was the result of longer term mortgage rates remaining low due to the relatively flat yield curve 
in order to fund balance sheet growth experienced during  deposits excluding brokered certificates of deposits increased  or million  the majority of which was experienced in higher costing money market and certificates of deposit 
in addition  we use brokered certificates of deposit  which increased million  or  when we determine that the all in cost of the brokered certificates of deposit is comparable to the borrowing cost for fhlbb advances with similar maturities  or to simply diversify our funding mix 
overall  during compared to  our net interest income was positively impacted million due to volume changes  with earning asset growth contributing million  while the need for increased funding to support the asset growth decreased net interest income million 
information on average balances  yields and rates for the past three years can be found in table on page table on page shows the changes from to in tax equivalent net interest income by category due to changes in rate and volume
