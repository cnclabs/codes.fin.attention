item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in part ii of this annual report 
this discussion also should be read in conjunction with the information in item ia of part i of this report  entitled risk factors  which contains information about certain risks and uncertainties that can affect our business and our financial performance in the future 
introduction and overview our business collectors universe  inc the company provides grading and authentication services to dealers and collectors of high value coins  sportscards  autographs  stamps  and vintage us currency notes and to sellers and purchasers of diamonds and colored gemstones 
we believe that our authentication and grading services add value to these collectibles and to diamonds and colored gemstones by enhancing their marketability and  thereby  providing increased liquidity to the dealers  collectors and consumers that own  buy and sell them 
we principally generate revenues from the fees paid for our authentication and grading services 
to a much lesser extent  we generate revenues from the sale of advertising on our websites  the sale of printed publications and collectibles price guides and advertising in such publications  the sale of collectors club membership subscriptions  from subscriptions to our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for certified coins  and the collectibles trade show conventions that we conduct 
recent business acquisitions 
on july   the company purchased substantially all the assets of coinfacts 
com  which operates an internet website on which it publishes detailed proprietary information and history on us coins for an aggregate purchase price of  on september   the company acquired the common stock of certified coin exchange cce  which operates a subscription based dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for third party certified coins for an aggregate purchase price of  on november   the company acquired gem certification appraisal lab gcal  a gemological certification and grading laboratory 
as part of that transaction  the company also acquired diamond profile laboratory  inc dpl  a scientific diamond light performance analysis laboratory  and all publishing and other rights to palmieri s market monitor  an educational and informative industry publication currently published by the gemological appraisal association  inc gaa 
the company paid an aggregate acquisition price of  in cash for gcal  dpl and the publishing and other rights to palmieri s market monitor 
on december   the company acquired the business and substantially all of the assets of gemprint corporation gemprint  consisting primarily of a patented technology for non invasive diamond identification which gemprint uses to digitally capture the unique refractive light pattern or gemprint of each diamond that is processed with that technology 
the company paid an aggregate purchase price for gemprint s business and assets of  in cash  assumed certain pre acquisition liabilities and lease commitments  and agreed to pay additional contingent purchase price of for each diamond that the company registers using the gemprint process in excess of  registrations per year during the five year period ending december  gcal has incorporated the gemprint process into its diamond grading process  so that each gcal authenticated and graded diamond also carries a gemprint image stored in gcal s registered database  which enables gcal to provide an additional measure of protection against misrepresentations of diamond quality that can occur by  for example  switching a diamond grading certificate issued for a higher quality diamond to a lower quality diamond 
effective july   we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests of expos unlimited llc expos  a california limited liability company engaged in the business of owning and conducting collectibles trade shows and conventions  for an aggregate purchase price of  in cash 
depending on the future revenue performance of expos  the company may become obligated to make contingent payments to those former owners of up to an aggregate of  in july expos owns and operates the long beach coin  stamp collectibles expo long beach and the santa clara coin  stamp collectibles expo santa clara  which comprise  in total  five trade shows that are held annually 
at both the long beach and santa clara expos  leading numismatic  philatelic and collectibles dealers offer rare and valuable collectibles to the public  while auctions of coins and currency are conducted by third party auction companies alongside exhibitions of major numismatic and collectible interest 
we offer on site authentication and grading services for the collectibles exhibited and bought and sold at those shows  with same day turnaround 
on august   we acquired american gemological laboratories agl  an international colored gemstone certification and grading laboratory 
agl is one of the leading third party authentication and grading services for colored gemstones  including colored gemstones that are sold at auction through sotheby s and christies and by jewelry retailers such as cartier and fred leighton 
the company paid an aggregate acquisition price of  in cash for agl  and  depending on the future revenue performance of agl  the company may become obligated to make payments of up to an aggregate of an additional  over the next five years 
the operating results of these acquired businesses have been consolidated into our operating results from the respective dates of their acquisition discontinued operations 
as previously disclosed  the remaining activities resulting from our divestiture of our collectibles auctions and sales businesses have been classified as discontinued operations and the discussion that follows focuses almost entirely on our authentication and grading businesses  which comprise substantially all of our continuing operations 
during the year ended june   we generated cash of  from the sales of our discontinued collectibles sales businesses and the liquidation of the inventories and accounts receivable of those businesses that were not included in those sales 
all of the remaining assets of those businesses  which totaled approximately  at june   were either liquidated during the fiscal year ended june  or fully reserved for on our balance sheet at june  factors that can affect our financial position and operating results factors that can affect our revenues 
our revenues are comprised of i fees generated by the authentication and grading of high value collectibles  and other high value assets consisting of diamonds and colored gemstones  and ii to a lesser extent  revenues from sales of collectibles club memberships  advertising on our websites and in printed publications and collectibles price guides  subscription based revenues primarily related to our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for certified coins  and fees earned from the management  operation and promotion of collectibles trade shows and conventions 
our authentication and grading revenues  which accounted for approximately of our total net revenues in the fiscal year ended june   are primarily affected by i the volume and mix  among coins  sportscards and other collectibles and high value assets  of authentication and grading submissions  ii in the case of coins and sportscards  the turn around times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times and iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and sportscards  on the one hand  and modern coins and sportscards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turn around times for vintage or classic coins and sports cards than they do for modern submissions  as vintage or classic collectibles are of significantly higher value and are more saleable by dealers than modern coins and sportscards 
five of our coin authentication and grading customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total net revenues in the fiscal years ended june  and as a result  the loss of any of those customers  or a decrease in the volume of grading submissions from any of them to us  would cause our net revenues to decline and  therefore  could adversely affect our profitability 
during the fiscal year ended june   revenue earned from our trade show related activities decreased by approximately  as a result of a lower volume of authentication and grading submissions at trade shows primarily by these customers 
we believe that this decline was primarily the result of lower gold prices in the first quarter of the current fiscal year  compared with the three months ended june   which reduced the volume of coin transactions and  therefore  the demand for our services at those shows 
however  trade show activity can vary depending on a number of factors  including the timing of the shows or short term decisions made by dealers during shows 
factors affecting our gross profit margins 
the gross profit margins on authentication and grading submissions also are primarily affected by i the volume and mix  among coins  sportscards and other collectibles and high value assets  of authentication and grading submissions  because we generally realize higher margins on coin submissions than on submissions of other collectibles and high value assets  ii in the case of coins and sportscards  the turn around times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times  iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and sportscards  on the one hand  and modern coins and sportscards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turn around times for vintage or classic coins and sports cards than they do for modern submissions  and iv the stage of development and the seasonality of our newly acquired businesses 
furthermore  because a significant proportion of our direct costs are fixed in nature  our gross profit is also affected by the overall volume of collectibles authenticated and graded in any period 
impact of economic conditions on financial performance 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from the collectibles and the diamond and colored gemstone markets 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by the financial performance of those markets  which depends to a great extent on i discretionary consumer spending and  hence  on the availability of disposable income  ii on other economic conditions  including prevailing interest and inflation rates  which affect consumer confidence  and iii the performance and volatility of the gold and other precious metals markets and the stock markets 
these conditions primarily affect the volume of purchases and sales of collectibles which  in turn  affects the volume of authentication and grading submissions to us  because our services facilitate commerce in collectibles 
accordingly  factors such as improving economic conditions which usually result in increases in disposable income and consumer confidence  and volatility in and declines in the prices of stocks and a weakening in the value of the us dollar  which often lead investors to increase their purchases of precious metals  such as gold bullion and other coins and collectibles  usually result in increases in submissions of collectibles for our services 
by contrast  the volume of collectibles sales and purchases and  therefore  the volume of authentication and grading submissions  usually decline during periods characterized by recessionary economic conditions and by declines in disposable income and consumer confidence or by increasing stock prices and relative stability in the stock markets 
the following table provides information regarding the respective number of coins  sportscards  autographs  currency  diamonds and colored gemstones that we graded or authenticated in the fiscal years ended june    and and their estimated values  which are the amounts at which those coins  sportscards and stamps and other high value assets were insured by the dealers and collectors who submitted them to us for grading and authentication 
units processed coins sportscards autographs stamps currency diamonds colored gemstones total declared values coins sportscards autographs stamps currency diamonds colored gemstones total we commenced our currency authentication and grading business in fourth quarter of we commenced the authentication and grading of diamonds in the second quarter of when we acquiredgcal and gemprint 
we commenced the authentication and grading of colored gemstones in the first quarter of  when we acquired agl 
overview of fiscal operating results as the following table indicates  we sustained an operating loss of nearly million in fiscal as compared to operating income of nearly million in fiscal  despite a increase in net revenues  due primarily to the combined effects of an increase in costs of revenues  a decline in our gross profit margin and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets 
as a result we sustained a loss from continuing operations of  in fiscal as compared to income from continuing operations of million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the above factors that impacted operating income  as well as decreased interest income earned in fiscal vs amount amount of change net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets operating income loss interest income  net other income income before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income loss net income loss per diluted share income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income loss net of gain on sales of discontinued businesses net of income taxes 
the decline in our gross margin in fiscal was due primarily to i an increase in coin grader related compensation costs  which are classified as costs of revenues in our statements of operations  ii a change in the mix of collectibles and high value assets graded to a lower proportion of coins  on which we realize higher margins than on authentication and grading of other collectibles  and iii the early stage of our diamond and colored gemstone businesses  as we build capacity in anticipation of increased revenues in future periods 
the increase in selling and marketing costs in fiscal was primarily due to i costs of approximately  primarily related to the promotion and marketing of our new businesses  and ii increased collectibles trade show expenses and promotional expenses  due primarily to an increase in the number of collectibles trade shows in which we participated in fiscal and increased resources allocated to each show 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal  was primarily attributable to expenses incurred in connection with i the acquisition and operation of newly acquired businesses  ii investments in infrastructure to support our expanded operations  and iii stock based compensation costs arising from new option grants and the issuance of restricted shares in fiscal the increase in amortization of intangible assets  primarily reflects amortization expense from i business acquisitions  and ii capitalized software projects 
these  as well as other factors affecting our operating results in fiscal  are described in more detail below 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of certain of our assets  principally accounts and notes receivable and inventories  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our accounts receivable or realize the value of our inventories in future periods 
those judgments  estimates  and assumptions are based on current information available to us at that time 
many of those conditions  trends and circumstances  however  are outside of our control and  if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our judgments or estimates were based  or other unanticipated events were to happen that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates 
changes in such estimates may require that we reduce the carrying value of the affected assets on our balance sheet which are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances to record such downward adjustments or write downs in the carrying value of assets such as accounts and notes receivable and inventory 
such write downs are recorded as charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are established or increased to take account of changed conditions or events 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events and changes in the conditions  events or trends upon which those estimates and judgments were made  can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record such assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of adjustments or write downs of this nature also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of events or changes in circumstances 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or conditions  such as increases in interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for our business  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the occurrence of an event or the onset of changes in economic circumstances for the full effects of such events or changes to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
under gaap  businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which  and also regarding the amounts at which  sales are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on a number of factors  including whether customers are granted rights to reject or adjust the payment for the services provided to them 
during fiscal year and in the first quarter of fiscal year  we acquired certain businesses and  in accordance with gaap  we accounted for those acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
that accounting method required us to allocate the amount paid for those businesses in excess of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and assumed  and to classify that excess as goodwill 
in accordance with gaap  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if we believe that goodwill has been impaired in the interim due to changing facts or events see long lived assets below 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have definite lives are subject to amortization over their remaining useful lives 
indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to on going evaluation for impairment 
management formally evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on the anniversary date of each of the acquisitions that gave rise to the recording of such assets 
in the event it was determined  from any such impairment analysis  that the estimated fair value of any such asset had declined below its carrying value  we would be required to recognize an impairment charge that would have the effect of reducing our income in the period when that charge was recognized 
in making our estimates and assumptions  we follow gaap in order to enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for possible write downs in the carrying values of our assets 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies and critical estimates that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policies 
we generally record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible or high value assets to the customer 
many of our authentication and grading customers prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectible items to us for authentication and grading 
we record those prepayments as deferred revenue until their graded collectibles are shipped back to them 
at that time  we record the revenues from the authentication and grading services we have performed for the customer and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
for certain dealers to whom we extend open account privileges  we record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible to the dealer 
with respect to our expos trade show business  we recognize revenue generated by the promotion  management and operation of collectibles conventions and trade shows in the periods in which the shows take place 
a portion of our net revenues are comprised of subscription fees paid by customers for a membership in our collectors club 
those memberships entitle members access to our on line and printed publications  and sometimes also to vouchers for free grading services 
we record revenue for this multi element service arrangement in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  by recognizing approximately of the subscription fee in the month following the membership purchase  on the basis that collectors club members typically utilize their vouchers for free grading services within days of subscribing for memberships 
the balance of the membership fee is recognized as revenue over the life of the membership  which can range from one to two years 
we evaluate  at least semi annually  the relative fair values of the deliverables and the percentage factors used to allocate the membership fee between the grading and the publication services provided under this membership service 
accounts receivable  notes receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our authentication and grading business  we extend payment terms to many of the larger  more creditworthy dealers or distributors who submit collectibles or high value assets to us for authentication and grading on a recurring basis 
in addition  primarily in connection with our coin dealer financing programs  we make advances or extend credit under notes receivable arrangements 
we regularly review our accounts and notes receivable  estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible amounts in each quarterly period 
the amount of that allowance is based on several factors  including the age and extent of significant past due amounts  and in the case of notes receivable  the current value of the collateral we hold as security for the payment obligations under the notes receivable  and known conditions or trends that may affect the ability of account debtors or note obligors to pay their accounts or notes receivable balances 
each quarter we review estimates of uncollectible amounts and such economic or other conditions or trends in order to enable us to determine whether or not to adjust the amount of the allowance 
for example  if the financial condition of certain dealers or economic conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments on their accounts or notes  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is created by recording a charge against income that is reflected in general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will cause a decline in our operating results in the period when the increase is recorded 
inventory valuation reserve 
our collectibles inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair value and have been reduced by an inventory valuation allowance to provide for potential declines in the value of those inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined and is periodically adjusted on the basis of market knowledge  historical experience and estimates concerning future economic conditions or trends that may impact the sale value of the collectibles inventories 
additionally  due to the relative uniqueness of some of the collectibles included in our collectibles inventory  valuation of such collectibles often involves judgments that are more subjective than those that are required when determining the market values of more standardized products 
if there were to be an economic downturn or there were to occur other events or circumstances that are likely to make it more difficult to sell  or that would lead us to reduce the sales prices of  those collectibles  it may become necessary to increase the reserve 
increases in this reserve will cause a decline in operating results  because such increases are recorded by charges against income 
grading warranty costs 
we offer a limited warranty covering the coins  sportscards  stamps and currency that we authenticate and grade 
under the warranty  if any collectible that was previously authenticated and graded by us is later submitted to us for re grading and either i receives a lower grade upon that resubmittal or ii is determined not to have been authentic  we will offer to purchase the collectible or pay the difference in value of the item at its original grade as compared with its lower grade 
however  this warranty is voided if the collectible  upon resubmittal to us  is not in the same tamper resistant holder in which it was placed at the time we last graded it 
we offer a similar limited warranty of two years duration on the diamonds we grade 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical trends and related experience 
to date our reserves have proved to be adequate 
however  if warranty claims were to increase in relation to historical trends and experience  we would be required to increase our warranty reserves and incur additional charges that would adversely affect our results of operations in those periods during which the warranty reserve is increased 
long lived assets 
we regularly conduct reviews of property and equipment and other long lived assets  including certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill  for possible impairment 
such reviews occur annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in full 
in order to determine if the value of a definitive lived asset is impaired  we make an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition and determine its fair value by discounting those cash flows to present value using a discount rate commensurate with management s estimates of the business risks associated with the asset 
if that estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value 
during fiscal  we recognized approximately  in impairment charges related to fixed assets 
stock based compensation 
we recognize share based compensation expense based on the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the black scholes option valuation method 
under that method  assumptions are made with respect to the expected lives of the options or other stock awards granted  the expected volatility of the company s stock  dividend yield percentage and the risk free interest rate at the date of grant 
in addition  under sfas no 
r  we recognize and report share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate that we expect will occur over the vesting period  which we estimate on the basis of historical forfeiture experience or other factors that could affect future forfeitures 
once we determine the compensation expense of a stock award  that expense is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over its vesting period using the straight line attribution method 
during fiscal  we issued restricted shares to outside members of the board of directors and to our ceo and  accordingly  we recognized stock based compensation over the vesting period of such restricted shares  based upon the closing stock prices of the shares on their respective dates of the grant  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
capitalized software 
in the fiscal year and  we capitalized approximately  and  respectively  of software development costs related to a number of in house software development projects  in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires that certain costs incurred  either from internal or external sources  be capitalized as part of intangible assets and amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the software 
planning  training  support and maintenance costs incurred either prior to or following the implementation phase are recognized as expense in the period in which they are incurred 
during the fiscal year ended june  and  we recorded approximately  and  respectively  as amortization expense related to such capitalized software projects 
we evaluate the carrying values of capitalized software to determine if the carrying values are impaired  and  if necessary  an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
income taxes and deferred tax assets 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the company s assets or liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  sfas no 
requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at june  and  approximately  and  respectively  were recorded as deferred tax assets  and management believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
as of june  and  there was and  respectively  recorded as a valuation allowance 
at june   we recorded a deferred tax liability in the amount of  primarily related to the acquisition of agl

grading and authentication fees consist primarily of fees generated from the authentication and grading of high value collectibles and high value assets 
fees generated from the authentication and grading of collectibles include coins  sportscards  autographs  stamps and currency and for high value assets  diamonds and colored gemstones 
to a lesser extent  we generate other related service revenues from sales of collectibles club memberships  the sale of advertising on our websites and in printed publications and collectibles price guides  subscription based revenues primarily related to our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for certified coins  and fees earned from promoting  managing and operating collectibles conventions

fiscal vs 
revenues increased by  or to  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year this increase was attributable primarily to i an increase of approximately  or  in revenues generated primarily by the non grading related services  primarily related to businesses we acquired in the fiscal year and first three months of fiscal  and ii an increase of approximately  or  in grading and authentication revenues 
the increase in grading and authentication revenues was largely attributable to increases in the volume of submissions of sportscards  other collectibles and diamonds and colored gemstones  which more than offset a decline in coin authentication and grading revenues 
approximately  of the increase in our fiscal revenues was generated by the collectibles convention business and our colored gemstone grading business  agl  both of which we acquired in the first three months of fiscal excluding the contribution made by those two businesses  revenues grew by in as compared to fiscal the increase in revenues generated by our non grading related service businesses in  as compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to i increased sales of collectors club memberships and cce subscriptions  ii an increase in interest earned as a result of an increase in the average amount of loans outstanding to dealers under our dealer finance program  and iii revenues generated by our collectibles convention business that was acquired at the beginning of fiscal the increase in grading and authentication revenues was driven by a increase in the average service price per unit for our grading and authentication businesses  compared to the prior fiscal year  offset by a decrease in total units graded 
coin grading revenues decreased by and the number of units graded decreased by  primarily driven by i a  decrease in show and invitational revenues ii a net  decrease in revenue attributable to a decrease in first strike bulk units graded  partially offset by an increase in the average service fees earned on those units  iii a  increase in revenue due to an increase in the volume of vintage collectibles submissions  and iv increases in other coin related services 
we believe the reduction in the first strike submissions was due to a number of factors  including a dispute related to pcgs trademarked first strike designation  which has since been resolved 
for sportscards  the increase in the number of units graded was partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue  and resulted in a increase in net revenues 
a increase in units graded and authenticated for other collectibles and diamonds and colored gemstones resulted in a increase in the grading and authentication revenues generated by those businesses in  as compared to  primarily driven by increases in the volume of diamond and stamp grading submissions  as well as the contribution to our revenues of our colored gemstone authentication and grading business  which we acquired in august of fiscal vs 
revenues increased by  or to  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year this increase was comprised of i an increase of  or  in grading and authentication revenues  and ii an increase in revenues from other services that we sell of approximately  or  that was primarily attributable to revenues generated by the businesses we acquired in the first six months of fiscal year approximately  of our fiscal revenues were generated by gcal and cce which we acquired in the first half of fiscal and by our currency authentication and grading business and our dealer lending business  which recorded their first full year of operations following their launch in the latter half of as a result  revenue growth in  excluding those four businesses  was over fiscal the increase in grading and authentication revenues in fiscal was driven by a increase in the number of units graded and authenticated  compared to the prior fiscal year 
coin grading revenues increased by  compared to a increase in the number of units graded  because modern coin grading submissions on which we earn a lower service fee represented a higher proportion of total coins graded in fiscal year  compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased submissions attributable to the company s first strike program in fiscal the number of sportscards graded increased by in  while sportscard grading revenues increased by  reflecting a decrease in the average grading service fee due to a higher proportion of sportscards graded at special pricing than in the number of other collectibles graded and authenticated in increased by  while grading and authentication revenues attributable to grading submissions of such collectibles increased by  primarily reflecting a reduction in pricing of our autograph authentication services to make those services more attractive to a larger number of dealers and collectors 
the number of coins graded and authenticated in fiscal increased by  as compared to the prior year  due primarily to an increase in coin submissions under the company s first strike program 
that increase more than offset a reduction in the number of units submitted by a coin dealer that had been our largest customer until the fourth quarter of fiscal  when its owner sustained a serious illness 
revenues attributable to coin submissions by that customer declined from of total revenues in fiscal to of total revenues for fiscal gross profit gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenues from net revenues 
gross profit margin is gross profit stated as a percent of net revenues 
the costs of authentication and grading revenues consist primarily of labor to authenticate and grade collectibles  production costs  credit card fees  warranty expense  occupancy  security and insurance costs that directly relate to providing authentication and grading services 
cost of revenues also includes printing and other direct costs of the revenues generated by our other non grading service businesses 
in addition  costs of revenues include stock based compensation earned by employees whose compensation is classified as part of the cost of authentication and grading revenues 
set forth below is information regarding our gross profits in the fiscal years ended june   and fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands gross profit gross profit margin vs 
the decline in our gross profit margin to in the fiscal year ended june   from in fiscal  was attributable to a number of different factors  including the following i a decline in the gross margin on coin authentication and grading  due primarily to an increase in costs resulting from the addition of new coin grading capacity in anticipation of increased volumes of submissions and to reduce the turnaround times within which coins are authenticated and graded  ii a decline in the gross margin realized on sportscard authentication and grading services  due primarily to a decrease in sportscard related advertising revenues and higher production costs incurred due to a change in the mix of sportscard units graded in as compared to  iii a change in the mix of our authentication and grading revenues to a lower proportion of coin authentication and grading revenues  on which we have historically realized higher margins than on the authentication and grading of other collectibles  as coin revenues represented approximately of total net revenues in the fiscal  compared to approximately of total net revenues in fiscal  and iv the early stage of our diamond and colored gemstone grading businesses as we build our diamond grading capacity in anticipation of increased revenues in future periods 
the decline was partially offset by a  decrease in the stock based compensation costs classified as cost of revenues in fiscal  from  in fiscal vs 
the decline in our gross profit margin to in fiscal year from in fiscal  was primarily attributable to i a modest decline in the average service fees for coin authentication and grading services due to a change in the mix of coin submissions in as compared to  ii a  increase in coin grader related compensation costs in fiscal  as a result of an increase in the number of graders and the implementation of changes to their compensation structure  iii a change in the mix of collectibles and diamonds graded to a lower proportion of coins  on which we realize higher margins than on the authentication and grading of other collectibles and diamonds  and iv stock based compensation expense of  for fiscal  recorded as required by sfas no

fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues vs 
the increases in selling and marketing expenses of  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues  in fiscal  compared to the prior fiscal year  were primarily attributable to i an increase of approximately  in sales and marketing costs to market and promote our new businesses  including our diamond grading business which we acquired in november  our colored gemstone grading business which we acquired in august  and our cce auction subscription business which we acquired in september  ii a  increase in sales and marketing costs primarily to promote our coin and sportscard authentication and grading services at trade shows including an increase in the number of trade shows attended and in other channels  and iii increases in general marketing costs  including an increase in marketing related compensation costs attributable to the hiring  in november  of a chief marketing officer for our diamond and colored gemstone grading businesses

the increase of  in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was primarily attributable to i costs of approximately  incurred in fiscal in connection with the commencement of marketing programs for the businesses that we acquired in the first six months of fiscal year  including  that was used to market our new diamond grading business  and the launch of the company s currency grading division  ii an increase of approximately  in marketing expenses incurred to promote our coin and sportscard grading services at trade shows  including an increase in the number of trade shows at which we offered those services to dealers and collectors  as compared to the number in  iii increased advertising and promotional expenses of approximately  incurred primarily to promote the company s first strike program  and iv increases in personnel costs in our customer service departments 
we made the decision to increase expenditures to promote our grading and authentication services at trade shows and to increase the number of trade shows at which we offer those services  because we are able to generate higher average coin and sportscard grading service fees at trade shows due to the faster turnaround times demanded by dealers and collectors attending those shows 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative g a expenses are comprised primarily of compensation paid to general and administrative personnel  including executive management  finance and accounting  information technology personnel  facilities management costs and other miscellaneous expenses 
since fiscal  g a expenses also have included stock based compensation costs arising from the grant of stock awards to executive management  finance and accounting  information technology personnel  in accordance with sfas no

such cost increases were partially offset by a reduction in litigation related costs in fiscal  compared to the same periods of fiscal  during which we incurred legal fees and expenses in connection with the miller trial 
stock based compensation costs including  of amortization expense related to restricted stock awards included in general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  compared with  for fiscal vs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal was primarily attributable to expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration into our operations of the businesses we acquired in the first half of  investments in infrastructure to support the growth of our businesses  litigation costs  audit and sarbanes oxley compliance costs and stock based compensation costs arising from the adoption of sfas r 
the increased costs associated with the acquired businesses totaled approximately  we also incurred approximately  in connection with the implementation of our business acquisition and expansion program in fiscal the increased infrastructure costs of approximately  in fiscal included investments in information technology systems and one time space related costs to support the growth of our businesses 
litigation costs were approximately  higher in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily attributable to the costs of the trial in the miller lawsuit that took place in the second quarter of fiscal increased audit  sarbanes oxley and tax compliance costs of approximately  were incurred primarily in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal these costs were partially offset by the  decrease in settlement of a lawsuit expense as discussed below

also included in general and administrative expenses in is a settlement of a legal action brought by real legends  inc  a seller of sports cards against when it was a game wiwag  a sports card dealer  and against us as a co defendant

as a result  the net cost to us of that settlement was  or of our fiscal net revenues 
amortization of intangible assets fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands amortization expense as a percentage of net revenues the increases in amortization expense are due primarily to an increase in intangible assets that resulted from the business acquisitions that we consummated in fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal and the amortization of capitalized software

as such  compensation expense was recorded at the date of grant only if the quoted market price of the underlying stock on that date exceeded the exercise or purchase price of the options or stock awards 
however  we have disclosed  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  pro forma net earnings and pro forma net earnings per share for fiscal year as if the fair value of all stock options and other stock awards  as of their respective grant dates  were recognized as expense over the vesting periods of those options in accordance with sfas no

under this transition method  compensation costs recognized in fiscal include i compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of july   based on their respective grant date fair values estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and ii compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to june   based on their respective grant date fair values estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  results for the corresponding periods of the prior year have not been restated and the company will continue to disclose the pro forma effect of option grants on net earnings and net earnings per share for periods ended prior to july  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we will also continue to account for equity instruments issued to persons other than company employees and directors non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for equity instruments issued to non employees are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the measurement date used to determine the fair value of any such equity instrument is the earliest to occur of i the date on which the third party performance is complete  ii the date on which it is probable that performance will occur  or iii if different  the date on which the compensation has been earned by the non employee 
however  no equity instruments were issued to non employees for goods or services during the three years ended june  we issue stock options or make restricted stock grants to employees and outside directors whose only condition for vesting are continued employment or service during the related vesting period 
typically  the vesting period is four years for employee awards and shorter periods for director awards  reflecting their service periods  although awards are sometimes granted with immediate vesting 
during fiscal  we issued a total of approximately  shares of restricted stock to our ceo and the non management members of the board of directors  which required us to recognize stock based compensation expense of approximately  during fiscal no shares of restricted stock were issued in fiscal and no stock based compensation related to restricted shares was recognized in the shares of restricted stock issued to our ceo and our board members have vesting periods of four years and one year  respectively 
compensation cost is determined based on the closing price of our stock  as reported by nasdaq  as of the date of the grant and is recognized as stock based compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight line basis  net of an estimated forfeiture rate of 
no shares of restricted stock were issued in fiscal we calculate stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock options as of the date granted using the black scholes option valuation model and various assumptions that are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
once the compensation cost of an option is determined  that cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the option 
for fiscal years and  stock based compensation consisted of compensation costs attributable to options granted in prior years that were outstanding but were not fully vested as of july   the adoption date of sfas no

options to purchase a total of  and  shares of our common stock were granted to employees during fiscal and  respectively 
these options are in addition to the restricted stock grants made in  as described above 
the method we employ to calculate stock based compensation is consistent with the method used to compute stock based compensation under sfas no 
 except that under sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate forfeitures  which we were not required to and did not estimate under sfas no 
during fiscal  we revised our forfeiture rate for stock options from for fiscal to for a total of  of compensation expense related to unvested stock based compensation awards remained unrecognized as of june  and will be recognized as compensation expense as follows year ending june  amount total these amounts  which are non cash expenses  do not include the cost of any additional stock based compensation awards that may be granted in future periods nor  as mentioned above  any changes that might occur in the company s award forfeiture percentage 
interest income  net interest income is generated on cash balances that we have invested  primarily in highly liquid money market accounts  short term bank certificates of deposit  auction rate securities and commercial paper instruments 
such interest income does not include the interest that we generate on loans we make pursuant to our dealer finance program  which are included in net revenues 
fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands interest income  net percent of net revenue vs 
the reduction in interest income  net to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  was primarily due to decreases in our average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances during fiscal  reflecting our use of cash to fund i business acquisitions in fiscal year  ii capital expenditures  primarily for purchase of fixed assets  iii the payment of quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders  and iv repurchases of our common stock under our stock buyback program  which more than offset cash generated from operations and the effect on interest income of increases in prevailing interest rates in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal vs 
the increase in interest income  net to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  was primarily attributable to increases in our average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  as a result of i the sale by us of  shares of our common stock in a public offering that we completed in the third quarter of fiscal  which generated net proceeds to us of  ii cash generated from the disposition of our collectibles sales businesses  and iii cash generated by operations  which more than offset cash expended for business acquisitions completed in fiscal year also contributing to the increase in interest income  net in fiscal was an increase in prevailing interest rates  as compared to fiscal provision benefit for income taxes fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands provision benefit for income taxes the income tax benefit recorded in fiscal reflects a pre tax loss in fiscal and an increase in permanent differences between the company s income for book purposes and for tax purposes  due primarily to the non deductibility of stock based compensation costs related to the grant of incentive stock options 
for fiscal and  our effective tax rates were and  respectively  reflecting increased permanent differences in fiscal  between the company s income for book purposes and tax purposes  primarily related to the non deductibility of compensation costs on incentive stock options  which the company was required to recognize for the first time in fiscal discontinued operations fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands income from discontinued operations  net of gains on sales of discontinued businesses net of income taxes as a result of our decision in fiscal to dispose of our collectibles sales businesses  in accordance with sfas no 
the assets and related liabilities of those businesses were classified as held for sale and their related operating results for the fiscal years  and have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
the income from discontinued operations includes i the losses or gains recognized on the sales of those businesses and the disposition of those assets of those businesses that we retained consisting primarily of inventories and accounts receivables  and ii for fiscal the results of ctp from september  to november  the date of its disposition 
the gain on disposal of the discontinued businesses related to additional consideration on the sales of those businesses that became determinable in fiscal  and  as the terms of the sales of some of those businesses provided for the payment to us of future consideration based on the performance of those businesses for periods subsequent to their sales 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality the following tables present unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the eight quarters beginning september  and ending on june  the information has been derived from our unaudited quarterly financial statements  which have been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the consolidated financial information set forth below includes all adjustments consisting of normal adjustments and accruals that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
these quarterly operating results  which reflect the reclassification of our results of operations between continuing operations and discontinued operations as a result of the disposition of our collectibles sales businesses  are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent periods 
generally  the revenues generated by our collectibles grading and authentication businesses are lower during our second quarter  which ends on december  than in other quarterly periods 
on the other hand  diamond and colored gemstone grading businesses which we acquired in november and august  respectively  generate higher revenues in our second quarter  which coincides with the winter holiday season  than in other quarterly periods 
our expectation is that  over time  our diamond and colored gemstone revenues will represent a higher proportion of total revenues and will reduce the effect of seasonality in the second fiscal quarter 
our collectibles convention business  which we acquired in july  adds to the variability in our quarter to quarter operating results  as its revenues vary based on the timing of the collectibles conventions it holds 
revenues for this business unit were significantly higher in the first  third and fourth quarters of  as compared to the second quarter ended december   because both its long beach and the santa clara collectibles conventions took place during the first  third and fourth quarters  whereas only the santa clara convention took place during the second quarter of in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company s coin grading revenues benefited from the success of our first strike program 
however  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  first strike revenues decreased by  due to a number of factors  including a dispute over rights to the first strike designation that we had used for this program 
although we expect that revenues from the first strike will improve in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as the dispute related to the first strike designation has now been resolved  there is no assurance that revenues from this program will be concentrated in our third and fourth fiscal quarters in future periods  as in previous years  or will be comparable to the revenues generated by this program in fiscal or the  decrease in revenue in the second quarter ended december   as compared to the immediately preceding quarter ended september   is net of a  increase in revenues generated by our diamond and colored gemstone grading and authentication businesses in that second quarter

historically  we have relied on internally generated funds  rather than borrowings  as our primary source of funds to support our operations 
we expect our authentication and grading services and our subscription services to provide us with positive operating cash flows  largely because i in many instances our customers prepay for those services at the time they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading or subscribe for our subscription based services  and ii we expect that  in the event of an on going decline in authentication and grading submissions  we will be able to reduce certain of our costs and thereby reduce the impact on our cash flows of such a decline 
during fiscal  operating activities of our continuing operations provided net cash of  compared with  generated in fiscal investing activities used net cash of  during fiscal  of which we used i  to fund the purchase of businesses that we acquired during the fiscal year  and ii  and  primarily for the purchase of fixed assets and software development costs  and iii  in advances on customer notes receivables offset by  proceeds from customer notes receivables attributed to collectors finance corporation 
in fiscal  financing activities used net cash of  including  to pay cash dividends to stockholders and  to repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock buyback program  partially offset by proceeds of  from the exercise of employee stock options 
bank line of credit 
as previously reported  in fiscal  we organized collectors finance corporation cfc  as a wholly owned subsidiary  to engage in the business of making loans primarily to coin or sportscards dealers 
all such loans are required to be collateralized by the delivery to us of collectibles that have a fair market value of at least the amount of the loans 
the loans are required to be repaid to us when those collectibles are returned to the dealers 
to provide a source of funding for those loans  in june  cfc obtained a revolving bank line of credit for the original term of two years pursuant to a loan and security agreement that permits cfc to borrow  at any one time  up to the lesser of i  or ii an amount equal to of the aggregate principal amount of those of its loan receivables that meet the bank s eligibility criteria 
borrowings under that credit line  the term of which was extended to september   which had a term of two years ending in june  are to bear interest at rates based on the bank s prime rate or libor  as applicable  and are to be secured by the loan receivables due cfc 
there were no borrowings outstanding under that line of credit during the fiscal year ended or at june  we expect to secure a comparable line of credit by september  cfc s obligations under this line of credit have been guaranteed by the company pursuant to a continuing guaranty agreement with the bank lender 
the terms of that agreement require the company to be in compliance with certain financial and other restrictive covenants  and require the consent of the lender i for the payment of cash dividends or repurchases of our common stock in an aggregate amount exceeding its annual net income in any year  and ii to consummate more than  of business acquisitions in any year 
the company was in compliance with all of these covenants at june  and received the required consents and a formal waiver from the lender for the purchases of expos unlimited and american gemological laboratories businesses  the repurchase of the company s common stock  and the payment of cash dividends during fiscal and outstanding financial obligations 
we had the following outstanding obligations under operating leases  net of sublease income at june   for years ending june thereafter with the exception of these obligations  we do not have any material financial obligations  such as long term debt  capital lease  or long term purchase obligations 
in the event that cfc incurs any borrowings under its line of credit  we will have an obligation to repay such borrowings  however  as noted above  there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at june  and cfc does not expect to incur any such borrowings during the quarter ending september  stock buyback program 
in december  our board of directors approved a stock buyback program that authorizes up to  of stock repurchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions  in accordance with applicable securities exchange commission rules  when opportunities to make such repurchases  at attractive prices  become available 
the company is under no obligation to repurchase any shares under the stock buyback program and the timing  actual number and value of shares that may be repurchased under that program will depend on a number of factors  including the company s future financial performance  its available cash resources and competing uses for the cash that may arise in the future  prevailing market prices of the company s common stock and the number of shares that become available for sale at prices that the company believes are attractive 
during fiscal year and  the company repurchased a total of  and  shares  respectively  of its common stock under this program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  and  respectively which includes transaction costs of approximately 
additional information regarding these share repurchases is set forth in item of this report 
dividends 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors adopted a dividend policy that called for the payment of quarterly cash dividends of per common share  for an expected annual cash dividend of per common share 
the first such quarterly cash dividend was paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal and quarterly cash dividends in that same per share amount were paid in the first and second quarters of fiscal the quarterly cash dividend was increased to per share  in the third quarter of fiscal and dividends in that same per share amount were paid in both the third and fourth quarters of in june  the board of directors approved another increase in the quarterly cash dividend to per common share  for an expected annual cash dividend to stockholders of per common share 
the first of such quarterly cash dividends of per share was paid on september  in the first quarter of fiscal to all stockholders of record as of august  dividends paid in fiscal totaled  and  assuming that we continue to pay quarterly cash dividends of per share during the balance of fiscal  we estimate that we will pay an aggregate of approximately  in cash dividends in fiscal we expect to fund those dividends with internally generated funds and available cash balances 
the declaration of cash dividends in the future  pursuant to the company s dividend policy  is subject to final determination each quarter by the board of directors based on a number of factors  including the company s financial performance and its available cash resources  its cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that the board may conclude would represent an opportunity to generate a greater return on investment for the company 
for these reasons  as well as others  there can be no assurance that the amount of the quarterly cash dividend will not be reduced  or that the board of directors will not decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends  in the future 
uses and sources of cash 
we plan to use our cash resources  consisting of internally generated cash flow and available cash and cash equivalent balances  to i expand our existing and implement new marketing programs  ii introduce new services for our customers  iii acquire or start up other high value collectibles or high value asset authentication and grading businesses  iv continue paying dividends to our stockholders  as determined by the board of directors  v make private and open market share repurchases under our stock buyback program if there are opportunities to do so at prices that we believe are attractive  and vi fund working capital requirements  and for other corporate purposes 
although we have no current plans to do so  we also may seek borrowings  and we may issue additional shares of our stock  to finance acquisitions of additional authentication and grading businesses 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
interpretation clarifies statement  accounting for income taxes  to indicate a criterion that an individual tax position would have to meet for some or all of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an entity s financial statements 
interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management is currently completing the process of evaluating the effect of fin on its consolidated financial statements  as of the beginning of the period of adoption  july  the company currently believes that the adoption of fin will not have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operation 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
the statement emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operation 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no

in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued to provide consistency between how registrants quantify financial statements 
historically  there have been two widely used methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements 
these methods are referred to as the roll over and iron curtain method 
the roll over method quantifies the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated 
exclusive reliance on an income statement approach can result in the accumulation of errors on the balance sheet that may not have been material to any individual income statement  but which may misstate one or more balance sheet accounts 
the iron curtain method quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
exclusive reliance on a balance sheet approach can result in disregarding the effects of errors in the current year income statement that results from the correction of an error existing in previously issued financial statements 
sab established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this approach is commonly referred to as the dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the roll over and iron curtain methods 
sab allows registrants to initially apply the dual approach either by retroactively adjusting prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or by recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of july  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings accumulated deficit 
use of this cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
we do not expect the initial application of sab to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operation 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with the fasb s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
as described above  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
or no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other relevant market rate or price risks 
due to the cash and cash equivalent balances that we maintain  we are exposed to risk of changes in short term interest rates 
at june   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  primarily invested in money market funds 
reductions in short term interest rates could result in reductions in the amount of that income 
however  the impact on our operating results of such changes is not expected to be material 
the company has no activities that would expose it to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risks
