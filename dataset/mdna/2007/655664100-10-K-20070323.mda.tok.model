competitive conditions all segments of our business are highly competitive

risk factors 
our business faces many risks 
we believe the risks described below outline the items of most concern to us 
however  these risks may not be the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries 
table of contents ability to respond to the business environment and fashion trends our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner 
any sustained failure to identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could have a material adverse affect on our business 
consumer spending at our stores may be affected by many factors outside of our control  including consumer confidence  weather and other hazards of nature that affects consumer traffic  and general economic conditions 
inventory management we strive to ensure the merchandise we offer remains fresh and compelling to our customers 
if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases  we may have excess inventory  which would result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance 
impact of competitive market forces the retail industry environment continues to change for many of our vendors and customers 
in the future  our competition may partner more effectively with vendors to serve the market s needs 
if we do not effectively respond to changes in our environment  we may see a loss of market share to competitors  declining same store sales  and declining profitability due to higher markdowns 
store growth strategy as of february  our plans for the next five years include opening new or relocated stores and remodeling existing stores 
our future net sales at new  relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections  which could reduce our operating performance 
performance in our new stores could also be impacted based on our ability to hire employees who are able to deliver the level of service customers have come to expect when shopping at our stores 
in the past  our expected opening dates have sometimes been delayed because of developer plan delays 
our future growth could be negatively impacted by delays to our store opening  relocating or remodeling plans 
information security and privacy the protection of our customer  employee  and company data is critical to us 
the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding  with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across our business units 
in addition  our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information 
a significant breach of customer  employee  or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales  fines  and lawsuits 
leadership development and succession planning the training and development of our future leaders is critical to our long term growth 
if we do not effectively implement our strategic and business planning processes to train and develop future leaders  our long term growth may suffer 
in addition  if unexpected leadership turnover occurs without established succession plans  our business may suffer 
multi channel strategy execution in  we started to make changes in our direct business that better align our online shopping environment and catalog with the customer experience in our full line stores 
these changes include aligning our direct merchandise offering with our full line stores to create a seamless experience for our customers between our stores  catalogs and web site  linking the full line stores and direct merchandise organization  reducing the number and frequency of our direct catalog mailings  and transitioning our direct inventory system onto our full line store platform  all while dealing with changes in the internet market in general 
based on our online sales trends and customer feedback in  we believe that our strategy shift will improve our future operating performance 
we also found that the technology changes will be more challenging than we initially anticipated 
executing this strategy may cost more and take longer than expected  which could impact our future operating performance 
brand and reputation we have a well recognized brand that is synonymous with the highest level of customer service and quality merchandise 
any significant damage to our brand or reputation may negatively impact same store sales  lower employee morale and productivity  and diminish customer trust  resulting in a reduction in shareholder value 
capital efficiency and proper allocation our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long term returns 
this includes spending on inventory  capital projects and expenses  managing debt levels  managing accounts receivable through our credit business  and returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
to a large degree  capital efficiency reflects how well we manage the other key risks to our company 
the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency 
our recent operating results have raised expectations about our performance 
if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns  we may fail to continue to produce similar financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value 
human resource regulations our policies and procedures are designed to comply with human resource laws such as wage and hour  meal and rest period  and commissions 
federal and state wage and hour laws are complex  and the related enforcement is increasingly aggressive  particularly in the state of california 
failure to comply with these laws could result in damage to our reputation  class action lawsuits  and dissatisfied employees 

table of contents employment and discrimination laws state and federal employment and discrimination laws and the related case law continue to evolve  making ongoing compliance in this area a challenge 
failure to comply with these laws may result in damage to our reputation  legal and settlement costs  disruption of our business  and loss of customers and employees  which would result in a loss of net sales and increased employment costs  low employee morale and attendant harm to our business and results of operations 
technology strategy we make investments in information technology to sustain our competitive position 
we expect to spend approximately million each year on information technology operations and system development  which is key to our growth strategy 
we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace 
targeting the wrong opportunities  failing to make the best investment  or making an investment commitment significantly above or below the requirements of the business opportunity may result in the loss of our competitive position 
in addition  an inadequate investment in maintaining our current systems may result in a loss of system functionality and increased future costs to bring our systems up to date 
we may implement too much technology  or change too fast  which could result in failure to adopt the new technology if the business is not ready or capable of accepting it 
excessive technological change affects the effectiveness of adoption  and could adversely affect the realization of benefits from the technology 
however  not implementing enough technology could compromise our competitive position 
regulatory compliance our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including those imposed by the sec  nyse  the banking industry  and foreign countries 
additional legal and regulatory requirements such as the sarbanes oxley act have increased the complexity of the regulatory environment 
in addition  foreign laws may conflict with domestic laws 
failure to comply with the various regulations may result in damage to our reputation  civil and criminal liability  fines and penalties  increased cost of regulatory compliance  and restatements of financial statements 
anti takeover provisions we are incorporated in the state of washington and subject to washington state law 
some provisions of washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us 
for example  one statutory provision prohibits us  except under specified circumstances  from engaging in any significant business transaction with any shareholder who owns or more of our common stock which shareholder  under the statute  would be considered an acquiring person for a period of five years following the time that such shareholder became an acquiring person

table of contents item legal proceedings 
cosmetics we were originally named as a defendant along with other department store and specialty retailers in nine separate but virtually identical class action lawsuits filed in various superior courts of the state of california in may  june and july that were consolidated in marin county superior court 
in may  plaintiffs filed an amended complaint naming a number of manufacturers of cosmetics and fragrances and two other retailers as additional defendants 
plaintiffs amended complaint alleged that the retail price of the prestige or department store cosmetics and fragrances sold in department and specialty stores was collusively controlled by the retailer and manufacturer defendants in violation of the cartwright act and the california unfair competition act 
plaintiffs sought treble damages and restitution in an unspecified amount  attorneys fees and prejudgment interest  on behalf of a class of all california residents who purchased cosmetics and fragrances for personal use from any of the defendants during the four years prior to the filing of the original complaints 
while we believe that the plaintiffs claims are without merit  we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs and the other defendants on july  in order to avoid the cost and distraction of protracted litigation 
in furtherance of the settlement agreement  the case was re filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california on behalf of a class of all persons who currently reside in the united states and who purchased department store cosmetics and fragrances from the defendants during the period may  through july  the court gave preliminary approval to the settlement  and a summary notice of class certification and the terms of the settlement was disseminated to class members 
on march   the court entered a final judgment approving the settlement and dismissing the plaintiffs claims and the claims of all class members with prejudice  in their entirety 
on april   two class members who had objected to the settlement filed notices of appeal from the court s final judgment to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
one of the objectors has since dropped her appeal  but the other filed her appeal brief on march  plaintiffs and defendants briefs were filed on may  the remaining objector filed her reply brief on june  the ninth circuit heard oral arguments on the appeal on march  it is uncertain how long the ninth circuit will take to issue its decision or when the appeal will be resolved 
if the district court s final judgment approving the settlement is affirmed on appeal  or the appeal is dismissed  the defendants will provide class members with certain free products with an estimated retail value of million and pay the plaintiffs attorneys fees  awarded by the court  of million 
we do not believe the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
other we are involved in routine claims  proceedings  and litigation arising from the normal course of our business 
we do not believe any such claim  proceeding or litigation  either alone or in aggregate will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows

vs gross profit our gross profit rate improved basis points  driven primarily by expansion of our merchandise margin rate 
all major merchandise categories contributed to this rate expansion  in part due to an increase of regular price merchandise sales 
our women s apparel category experienced significant rate expansion in the second half of the year due to strategy changes that brought a sharper focus to our merchandise offering 
for the first time  this year our buying and occupancy costs included expenses related to stock options awarded primarily to our merchant and product development groups 
these costs were and impacted our gross profit rate by basis points 
despite this additional expense  we leveraged our buying and occupancy costs on sales growth 
sales growth and continued inventory discipline resulted in improvement in our inventory turnover rate  which increased 
vs gross profit while we showed growth in our same store sales in  we held buying and occupancy costs relatively consistent with in addition  our merchandise costs increased in line with our sales increases 
as a result  we drove a gross profit rate improvement of basis points

selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in millions fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative rate vs selling  general and administrative expenses we expect our selling  general and administrative rate to decrease when sales increase as we gain leverage on our fixed overhead costs 
this rate decreased in  but the decrease was less than the improvement

r  share based payment sfas r 
vs selling  general and administrative expenses the primary component of our selling  general and administrative expenses that varies with our same store sales is our selling costs 
most of our other expenses do not fluctuate with changes in our same store sales 
in  as our same store sales increased  our general and administrative expenses were essentially in line with and we benefited from a favorable adjustment to our workers compensation reserve 
these factors combined to give us a basis point decrease in our selling  general and administrative rate 
forecast of selling  general and administrative expenses in  our selling  general and administrative rate is expected to increase by to basis points due to the impact of an upcoming securitization transaction see off balance sheet financing on page and incremental new store pre opening costs see investing activities on page 
these two factors  which are expected to increase our selling  general and administrative expenses by to  or to basis points  will offset the expected to basis points of rate improvement from additional sales leverage on fixed overhead costs

our strong cash flow and low debt levels place us in a position of flexibility to support our value growth plan 
operating activities dollars in millions vs operating activities net cash flow from operating activities increased from to  an increase of primarily because we reduced our investment in asset backed securities by to fund the repayment of of private label securitization debt 
also  we were successful in expanding our private label charge card and co branded nordstrom visa credit card programs  which increased our investment in these programs but provided increased earnings 
vs operating activities net cash flow from operating activities increased from to  an increase of primarily due to the growth in our net earnings 
our co branded visa credit card program continued to grow in as we increased the capital we allocate to fund this program 
under our co branded visa program  we earn interchange and finance charge income and we offer card holders merchandise certificates  which can be redeemed in our stores  similar to a gift certificate 
in the course of negotiating for store locations  some developers offer up front cash payments to defray our capital expenditures in exchange for our commitment to operate a store in their development 
in  we received incentives totaling  which is an increase of over property incentive receipts vary year to year  depending on the number of our store openings and remodels and the arrangements we negotiate with developers 
forecast for operating activities in  we will move the co branded visa receivables onto our balance sheet as part of the securitization transition see off balance sheet financing on page 
we expect operating cash flows to decrease due to this change and receivable growth 
increased net earnings are expected to partially offset this decrease 
investing activities dollars in millions in the past three years  we have had two principal types of investing activities capital expenditures and short term investments 
capital expenditures our annual capital expenditures ranged from to between and the largest components of these expenditures were for new or relocated stores and store remodels 
in we opened one full line store at the gardens mall in palm beach gardens  florida  we relocated our topanga store in canoga park  california and we opened one rack store at grand plaza in san marcos  california 
together these openings increased our gross square footage approximately 
our total square footage as of february  was million 
in  of our capital expenditures were for new or relocated stores  were for major remodels and were for minor remodels 
in addition  of our capital expenditures were for information technology and were for other projects 
our capital expenditures over the last three years totaled these capital expenditures were offset by property incentives of with these capital expenditures  we added stores  enhanced existing facilities and improved our information systems 
more than million square feet of retail store space have been added during this period  representing an increase of since january  we expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately  over the next five years  with to planned for we plan to use of this investment to build new stores  on remodels  on information technology and for minor remodels and other projects 
compared to the previous five years  capital expenditures will increase  with increased spending allocated to new stores 
our current strategy calls for a to annual increase in square footage growth  with new or relocated stores announced through  over half of these stores will be in our northeast and midwest regions 
the estimated capital project spending does not include potential investments in new stores resulting from the current industry consolidation 
we believe we have the capacity to address additional capital investments should opportunities arise 
in the second half of  we expect to open three new full line stores and one rack store  and in the first quarter of  we expect to open four new full line stores 
we typically incur the majority of our pre opening costs in the six months prior to opening 
in  new store pre opening costs  which will be recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  are expected to impact our earnings per diluted share by 
as of february   we were contractually committed to spend for constructing new stores  remodeling existing stores  and other capital projects 
short term investments in  we sold our short term investments and primarily used the proceeds for common stock repurchases 

table of contents financing activities dollars in millions over the past three years  our net operating cash inflows have exceeded our net investing cash outflows  and we used this excess cash flow to repay long term debt  pay dividends  and to repurchase our common stock 
over this three year period  the price of our common stock has increased  which spurred stock option exercises that also increased our net cash

debt to capital ratio our recent favorable operating results increased our shareholders equity and allowed us to reduce our long term debt  which contributed to a decrease in our debt to capital ratio from at the end of to at the end of in the third quarter of  we repaid of long term debt by selling a portion of our interest in the co branded nordstrom visa receivable trust 
this arrangement put us below our target debt to capital range of to 
in the first quarter of  we will be increasing our debt and asset levels as a result of a new co branded nordstrom visa securitization transaction 
both the co branded nordstrom visa receivables and the debt backed by those receivables will be recorded on our balance sheet 
in anticipation of this new securitization structure  we are adjusting our target debt to capital ratio range to to going forward 
off balance sheet financing dollars in millions through our wholly owned federal savings bank  nordstrom fsb  we offer a private label charge card and two co branded nordstrom visa credit cards 
the private label charge card receivables are held in a trust  which may issue third party debt that is securitized by the private label receivables  the private label program is treated as on balance sheet  with the receivables  net of bad debt allowance  and debt  if any  recorded on our balance sheet  the finance charge income recorded in other income including finance charges  net  and the bad debt expense recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the co branded nordstrom visa credit card receivables are held in a separate trust the visa trust  which may issue third party debt that is securitized by the co branded nordstrom visa credit card receivables 
the co branded nordstrom visa credit card program is treated as off balance sheet 
we record the fair value of our interest in the visa trust on our balance sheet  gains on the sale of receivables to the visa trust and our share of the visa trust s finance income in other income including finance charges  net 
as of february   the visa trust had co branded nordstrom visa credit card receivables with a total face amount of and had outstanding two series of notes held by third parties of class a b notes that mature in april  and of variable funding notes that may be renewed in august in fiscal  the co branded nordstrom visa credit card receivables had an average gross yield of and average annual credit losses of 
the weighted average interest rate on the third party notes was 
following the repayment of the visa trust s notes in april  we plan to merge the private label charge card and co branded visa programs into one securitization program 
the advantage of a combined program is that it will provide us with greater borrowing flexibility as we will be able to borrow funds based on the outstanding balance of the combined receivables  it will lower our administrative costs  and will give us one method of accounting for these similar programs on balance sheet 
when we combine these programs  we plan to also increase our borrowing against these combined receivables to a range of to nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries 
table of contents in the first quarter  the visa trust requires that cash receipts be used to establish a pre funding account to repay the a b notes  this pre funding balance reduces the overall yield in the visa trust  which is expected to reduce our earnings by after we combine the securitization programs in april  our investment in the visa trust will be reclassified from available for sale securities to receivables  at fair value with no allowance for credit losses 
based on past payment patterns  these receivables will be repaid within eight months 
during that time  we expect to record incremental bad debt write offs and certain finance charge income as an adjustment to the fair value of the receivables acquired  reducing the yield of these receivables  these costs are expected to be and will be recorded over the eight month repayment period 
following the recognition of the yield reduction in the first quarter and the of other adjustments through the remainder of  the private label charge card receivables and the co branded visa credit card receivables will be recorded at historical cost  net of bad debt allowances  on our balance sheet 
as card holders continue to use their co branded visa credit cards  new receivables will be recorded 
those new receivables will be recorded at historical cost  as those receivables age  we will establish an allowance for bad debts based on historical write off experience 
we expect to record to of bad debt provision in selling  general and administrative expenses from these new receivables 
the classification of this expense is different because these receivables are on balance sheet  in the past  the write off experience was considered in our investment yield and reflected in other income including finance charges  net 
we do not expect the co branded visa credit card receivable write off experience to be impacted by the transition in the accounting treatment  only the classification of this expense will change 
as noted above  all debt issued by the combined trust will be recorded on our balance sheet  so the related interest expense will be recorded in interest expense  net 
currently  the interest expense of the debt issued by the visa trust reduces our overall yield from our investment and is recognized in other income including finance charges  net 
with the bad debt and interest expense impacts shifting out of other income including finance charges  net  we expect our other income line item on our earnings statement to increase by to we expect our earnings before income tax expense to be reduced by  or per diluted share  for the transition from fair value to historical cost 
the other earnings statement classification changes associated with the accounting treatment for the combined securitization program are not expected to impact our earnings before income tax expense 
in the future  our roic rate will be reduced because we will recognize additional invested capital from the securitization program transition 
interest rate swaps dollars in millions to manage our interest rate risk  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in  which had a notional amount expiring in january under the agreement  we receive a fixed rate of and pay a variable rate based on libor plus a margin of set at six month intervals at february

in february  we announced that we are exploring strategic options that would benefit both nordstrom and fa onnable  including a possible sale of the brand 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the policies we feel are critical 
off balance sheet financing our co branded nordstrom visa credit card receivables are transferred to a third party trust on a daily basis 
the balance of the receivables transferred to the trust fluctuates as new receivables are generated and old receivables are retired through payments received  charge offs  or credits from merchandise returns 
the trust issues securities that are backed by the receivables 
certain of these securities or beneficial interests are sold to third party investors and those remaining securities are issued to us 
we recognize gains or losses on the sale of the co branded nordstrom visa receivables to the trust based on the difference between the face value of the receivables sold and the estimated fair value of the assets created in the securitization process 
the fair value of the assets is calculated as the present value of their expected cash flows 
the discount rate used to calculate fair value represents the volatility and risk of the assets 
assumptions and judgments are made to estimate the fair value of our investment in asset backed securities 
we have no other off balance sheet transactions 
inventory our merchandise inventories are primarily stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method first in  first out basis 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory 
to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down  we consider current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions  our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
we also reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of net sales for the period from the most recent semi annual inventory count based on historical shrinkage results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues net of estimated returns and we exclude sales taxes 
our retail stores record revenue at the point of sale 
our catalog and online sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon estimated delivery to the customer 
as part of the normal sales cycle  we receive customer merchandise returns 
to recognize the financial impact of sales returns  we estimate the amount of goods that will be returned and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly 
we utilize historical return patterns to estimate our expected returns 
vendor allowances we receive allowances from merchandise vendors for purchase price adjustments  cooperative advertising programs  cosmetic selling expenses and vendor sponsored contests 
purchase price adjustments are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales after an agreement with the vendor is executed and the related merchandise has been sold 
allowances for cooperative advertising programs and vendor sponsored contests are recorded in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred 
allowances for cosmetic selling expenses are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred 
any allowances in excess of actual costs are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 
self insurance we retain a portion of the risk for certain losses related to health and welfare  workers compensation and general liability claims 
liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both losses reported and losses incurred but not yet reported 
we estimate our ultimate cost based on internal analysis of historical data and independent actuarial estimates 
favorable trends in california caused a decrease in our workers compensation costs in allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in our private label credit card receivable as of the balance sheet date 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on several factors  including historical trends of aging of accounts  write off experience and expectations of future performance 
we recognize finance charges on delinquent accounts until the account is written off 
delinquent accounts are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible  usually after the passage of days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
intangible asset impairment testing we review our goodwill and acquired tradename annually for impairment in the first quarter or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
the goodwill and acquired tradename associated with our fa onnable business are our largest impairment risk 
the fair value of our intangible assets has exceeded their carrying value in each of the most recent three years 

table of contents leases we lease the land or the land and building at many of our full line stores  and we lease the building at many of our rack stores 
additionally  we lease office facilities  warehouses and equipment 
we recognize lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
in  we corrected our lease accounting policy to recognize lease expense  net of property incentives  from the time that we control the leased property 
we recorded a charge of net of tax in the fourth quarter of to correct this accounting policy 
the impact of this change was immaterial to prior periods 
many of our leases include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial commitment period  subject to terms agreed to at lease inception 
for leases that contain rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases  we record the difference between the rent expense and the rental amount payable under the leases in liabilities 
some leases require additional payments based on sales and are recorded in rent expense when the contingent rent is probable 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods  and income tax disclosures 
the provisions of fin are effective for us as of the beginning of our fiscal year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
in seeking to minimize risk  we manage exposure through our regular operating and financing activities 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments 
interest rate exposure is managed through our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings 
short term borrowing and investing activities generally bear interest at variable rates  but because they have maturities of three months or less  we believe that the risk of material loss was low  and that the carrying amount approximated fair value
