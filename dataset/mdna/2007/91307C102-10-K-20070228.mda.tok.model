glaxo wellcome assignment in january  glaxo wellcome  inc assigned to us all rights to the use of the stable prostacyclin analog now known as remodulin 
the patent covering the use of remodulin for pah does not expire in the united states until october as extended see patent term extensions below and until various dates from september to august in nine other countries 
pharmacia license in december  pharmacia upjohn company exclusively licensed to us certain patents  a patent application and know how for the composition and production of the stable prostacyclin analog now known as remodulin 
we filed our own united states patent application for a new synthesis and production method for remodulin in october  and the patent was granted in august two additional patents covering this synthesis and production method were granted in march and august we believe that our method of synthesis is a substantial improvement over the pharmacia method and we are using our unique synthesis method rather than the licensed pharmacia method for the production of remodulin 
we have also registered two patents and have one pending patent application with respect to additional remodulin synthesis improvements 
altarex medical corp 
agreement in april and august  we entered into license agreements with altarex for the exclusive worldwide rights other than certain european and middle eastern countries to certain patents relating to a platform of immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies 
these antibodies are currently in various stages of clinical and preclinical testing 
the lead compound  ovarex mab oregovomab  is in phase iii clinical trials 
the compounds and the method of using the compounds are the subject of a combination of issued patents and pending applications in the united states and around the world 
the issued patents have expiration dates ranging from to subject to extension see patent term extensions below 
additional inventions relating to the compounds may be owned jointly by us and altarex or individually by altarex  depending on the source of the invention 
in december  altarex was acquired by virexx medical corporation in an all stock for stock transaction 
altarex now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of virexx 
these transactions have not affected our licensing agreements 
stanford university and new york medical college licenses in  we acquired the exclusive license to patents from stanford university and new york medical college related to arginine based dietary supplements that work to enhance the level of naturally occurring nitric oxide in the vascular system 
the licenses cover worldwide territories and are valid for the life of the patents expiration dates ranging from to 
we will own all rights to any new products derived from these licenses 
supernus pharmaceutical license in june  united therapeutics entered into an exclusive license agreement with supernus for use of certain technologies developed by supernus in the formulation of united therapeutics sustained release oral treprostinil 
under the agreement  in return for the license  united therapeutics will pay supernus certain amounts upon the achievement of specified milestones based on the development of oral treprostinil and its commercial launch 
in addition  the agreement provides that we will pay a royalty to supernus based on net worldwide sales of the initial product 
any such royalty will be paid for approximately twelve years commencing with the first product sale and is subject to adjustments as specified in the agreement 
additional milestone payments and royalty payments may be due for the development and the commercialization of other products developed using the technology granted in this license 
patent term extensions we believe that some of the patents to which we have rights may be eligible for extensions of up to five years based upon patent term restoration procedures under the hatch waxman act in the united states  and under similar procedures in europe 
in february  we were granted a five year patent term extension by the united states patent and trademark office for a patent covering the method of treating pah using remodulin 
us patent number  entitled method of treating pulmonary hypertension with benzidine prostaglandins  was originally scheduled to expire on october  it will now expire on october  the five year hatch waxman act extension is the maximum extension allowed under usc research development expenditures we are engaged in research and development and have incurred substantial expenses for these activities 
these expenses generally include the cost of acquiring or inventing new technologies and products as well as their development 
research and development expenses during  and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations major research and development projects for additional information regarding expenditures related to major research and development projects 
manufacturing and supply we make treprostinil sodium  the active ingredient for remodulin and viveta  and treprostinil diethanolamine  the active ingredient for oral treprostinil  in chicago  illinois 
we are currently transitioning these activities to our new laboratory in silver spring  maryland 
the validation process for making these treprostinil based compounds in the silver spring facility commenced in october we anticipate filing with the fda and other regulatory agencies for approval to use the new facility for commercial purposes in mid  with regulatory agency approvals expected in late we currently maintain a treprostinil sodium inventory for over two years of expected demand 
with the transfer of manufacturing operations to the silver spring facility  we are also changing our internal manufacturing process 
initially  in chicago  we had produced treprostinil beginning with basic chemicals and completing the full manufacturing process 
over the last two years  we have been modifying the process to begin treprostinil development with advanced intermediate compounds made by outside vendors 
these advanced intermediates have been used to produce treprostinil sodium for research and development purposes and for making treprostinil diethanolamine for our oral formulation 
we anticipate that upon commercialization of oral treprostinil  the need for treprostinil diethanolamine will be greater than the need for treprostinil sodium for inhaled and infusion therapies 
as a result  the manufacturing process will consist of starting with the advanced intermediate compound  making treprostinil diethanolamine and then converting that compound to treprostinil 
we expect this to allow us the most flexibility and efficiency in meeting future demands for both forms of active ingredients 
we have approved three vendors to supply the advanced intermediate compounds in order to reduce the risk of supply shortages 
baxter healthcare corporation formulates remodulin for us 
the term of our initial agreement with baxter ended in october the contract is renewable for successive eighteen month terms and has been renewed 
we rely on cardinal health  inc for conducting stability studies on remodulin  formulating treprostinil for inhalation use  formulating treprostinil diethanolamine for the oral clinical trials  and analyzing other products we are developing 
prior to november  medtronic minimed provided the delivery device used to administer subcutaneous remodulin to patients 
in october  we commenced the development process for making the active ingredient in ovarex at our silver spring  maryland facility 
the current material being used in our clinical trials was made by abbott laboratories  which has subsequently closed the facility that had been used to manufacture this type of material 
as a result  we will be producing this drug ourselves 
the currently available drug expires in early we are required by fda rules to demonstrate the comparability of our silver spring produced antibody to the drug made by abbott laboratories 
in parallel with this effort  we will be producing validation registration batches for fda approval 
we expect that this process should be completed in early commercial products manufactured by contract manufacturers include arginine and telemedicine products 
although we believe that other manufacturers and suppliers could provide similar products  services and materials  there are few companies that could replace these manufacturers and suppliers 
a change in supplier or manufacturer could cause a delay in the manufacture  distribution and research efforts associated with the respective product or result in increased costs 
for further discussion on this risk  see item a risk factors we have limited experience with production and manufacturing and depend on third parties  who may not perform  to synthesize and manufacture many of our products 
competition many drug companies engage in research and development to commercialize products to treat cardiovascular  cancer and infectious diseases 
we are aware of four existing treatments already approved in the united states for the treatment of pah with which remodulin competes 
they are flolan  an intravenously delivered prostacyclin marketed by gilead sciences  inc  tracleer  an oral endothelin antagonist marketed by actelion ltd  revatio  a pde inhibitor  a formulation of the very successful drug viagra marketed by pfizer  inc  and ventavis  an inhaled prostacyclin marketed by actelion ltd in the united states and by schering ag in europe 
two additional oral endothelin antagonists are in development 
one is thelin  being developed by encysive pharmaceuticals  inc  and the other is ambrisentan  being developed by gilead sciences  inc in addition  competitors may develop and commercialize other products that compete with our products and may do so more rapidly than us 
due to their ease of use  tracleer and revatio are generally considered front line therapies for newly diagnosed patients 
flolan and remodulin  which are more complex infusion therapies  are generally considered later stage therapies for sicker patients 
the use of tracleer  revatio and ventavis  either alone or in combination with each other  will  for many patients delay their need for infusion therapy 
as a result  while we may not currently compete head to head with these drugs as front line therapy  the success of their use affects our commercial operations 
as we develop both inhaled and oral treprostinil therapies  we will be expanding our range of therapeutics to front line 
for further discussion on this risk  see item a risk factors we are aware of investigational products being developed for the treatment of pah with which our products may have to compete 
tracleer is the first in a class of drugs known as endothelin antagonists 
revatio is a phosphodiesterase type pde inhibitor 
these drugs block the endothelin and the pde enzyme  respectively  which results in the dilation of pulmonary blood vessels in patients with pah 
endothelin antagonists and pde inhibitors may be used in combination with prostacyclins since these drugs provide symptomatic relief in different ways and might complement each other to treat seriously ill patients 
many companies market or are developing products that will compete with our arginine products in the nutritional supplement market 
however  we are the only company that owns the patent rights to claim the use of the key ingredient  arginine  for maintaining vascular function 
three competitors have agreed to pay a royalty to us on their arginine products  and others have agreed to discontinue infringing activities 
holter and event monitoring analysis services and systems are provided by many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors 
we compete with all of these companies for customers  funding  access to licenses  personnel  third party collaborators  product development and commercialization 
almost all of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  product development and marketing  clinical trials and regulatory matters  than we do 
governmental regulation the research  development  testing  manufacture  promotion  marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated by governmental agencies in the united states and in other countries 
drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda in the united states and similar regulatory bodies in other countries 
the steps ordinarily required before a new drug may be marketed in the united states  which are similar to steps required in most other countries  include preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies in animals  formulation studies and the submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application for a new drug  clinical studies in healthy volunteers  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication  the submission of a new drug application to the fda  and fda review and approval of the new drug application prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  toxicity and formulation  as well as animal studies 
the results of preclinical testing are submitted to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application 
a day waiting period after the filing of each investigational new drug application is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans 
at any time during this day period or at any time thereafter  the fda may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials until it authorizes trials under specified terms 
the investigational new drug application process may be extremely costly and may substantially delay development of our products 
moreover  positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials 
clinical trials to support new drug applications are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
during phase i  the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess its effects on bodily functions and safety  including side effects associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific  targeted indications  assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  then phase iii trials  also called pivotal studies  major studies or advanced clinical trials  are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically diverse clinical study sites 
after successful completion of the required clinical testing  a new drug application or a biologics license application both referred to as an application is typically submitted 
the fda may request additional information before accepting an application for filing  in which case the application must be resubmitted with the additional information 
once the submission has been accepted for filing  the fda reviews the application and responds to the applicant 
the review process is often significantly extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification 
the fda may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee for review  evaluation and recommendation as to whether it should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
the fda may also inspect the manufacturing facility before approving an application 
if fda evaluations of the application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or an approvable letter 
an approvable letter will usually contain a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application and authorization of commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
the fda also may refuse to approve the application and issue a not approvable letter  outlining the deficiencies in the submission and often requiring additional testing or information 
at the request of an applicant  the fda may designate a product as an orphan drug if the drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition 
a disease or condition is considered rare if it affects fewer than  people in the united states 
if an applicant obtains the first fda marketing approval for a certain orphan drug  the applicant will have a seven year exclusive right as against generic versions to market the drug for the orphan indication 
the fda has approved the orphan designation for remodulin for the treatment of pah by all routes of administration that we are currently developing  a designation that includes both primary pulmonary hypertension and secondary pulmonary hypertension 
ovarex has received both orphan drug and fast track designations by the fda for the treatment of patients with certain types of stage iii or iv ovarian cancer 
under the food and drug administration modernization act fdama  fast track designations are designed to help accelerate the regulatory approval process for key investigational drugs that address unmet medical need 
the designations provide the potential for expedited fda review and accelerated approval 
subcutaneous remodulin was approved by the fda for the treatment of pah in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise  and intravenous remodulin was approved for those patients not able to tolerate subcutaneous infusion 
if regulatory approval of our other products is granted  such approvals will similarly be limited to certain disease states or conditions 
the manufacturers of approved products and their manufacturing facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections 
furthermore  identification of certain side effects or the occurrence of manufacturing problems after a drug is on the market could cause subsequent withdrawal of approval  reformulation of the drug  additional preclinical testing or clinical trials  and changes in labeling of the product 
the hatch waxman act provides that patent terms may be extended to compensate for some of the patent life that is lost during the fda regulatory review period for the product 
this extension period would generally be one half the time between the effective date of an investigational application and the submission date of an application  plus all of the time between the submission date of an application and the approval of that application  subject to a maximum extension of five years 
similar patent term extensions are available under european laws 
following fda approval  we filed a patent term extension application with the united states patent and trademark office for our patent covering the method of treating pah using remodulin following fda approval 
the application was approved in february and the patent now expires on october  outside of the united states  our ability to market our products will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include some or all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
at present  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level  although  within europe  procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union eu member state 
in the eu  marketing authorizations may be submitted through a centralized body or through a decentralized or a national level process 
the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and high technology products and is available at the applicant s option for other products 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all eu member states 
the decentralized procedure is available for all medicinal products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions  changes existing procedures for national approvals and establishes procedures for coordinated eu actions on products  suspensions and withdrawals 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization for which mutual recognition is sought may submit an application to one or more eu member states  certify that the dossier is identical to that on which the first approval was based  or explain any differences and certify that identical dossiers are being submitted to all member states for which recognition is sought 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each eu member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
the procedure encourages member states to work with applicants and other regulatory authorities to resolve disputes concerning mutual recognition 
lack of objection of a given country within days automatically results in approval in that country 
following receipt of marketing authorization in a member state  the applicant is then required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with a separate prescription pricing authority in that country 
to secure european regulatory approvals for the use of remodulin for pah we used the mutual recognition procedure and filed our first marketing authorization application in france in february review of our application was completed in as a result  remodulin was approved in countries of the eu under the mutual recognition process described above 
we withdrew applications in spain  the united kingdom and ireland with the intent of resubmitting the applications when we file for approval for intravenous remodulin 
we have to file for intravenous remodulin approval using the mutual recognition process 
we have filed our application with our host country  france 
the application is currently under review 
regulatory applications are pending in other countries 
arginine and telemedicine products are manufactured at contract facilities that are regulated by the fda under different laws and regulations that apply to dietary supplements in the case of arginine  and medical devices  in the case of telemedicine products 
the telemedicine devices designed and sold by medicomp have received marketing clearance from the fda under section k of the food  drug and cosmetic act 
medical devices are required to be manufactured in conformance with the fda s quality system regulations 
in the united states  reimbursements are provided for remodulin by many independent third party payers  as well as the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare is the federal program which provides health care benefits to certain senior citizens and certain disabled and chronically ill persons  and medicaid is the federal program administered by the states to provide health care benefits to certain indigent persons 
the medicare contractors who administer the program provide reimbursement for remodulin at a rate generally equal to of the published average wholesale price  as recommended by us 
the state medicaid programs generally provide reimbursement for remodulin at a price that is below the published average wholesale price 
beginning in  the medicare modernization act requires that we and the centers for medicare and medicaid services negotiate a new price for remodulin 
we anticipate that the new rules will not have an impact on remodulin reimbursement rates in in return for including remodulin in the medicare and medicaid programs  we have agreed to pay a rebate to state medicaid agencies that provide reimbursement for remodulin 
we have also agreed to sell remodulin under contracts with the veterans administration  department of defense  public health service and numerous other federal agencies as well as certain hospitals that are designated as b entities entities designated by federal programs to receive discounted drug prices at prices that are significantly below the price we charge to our distributors 
these programs and contracts impose many regulations and restrictions on our business 
failure to comply with these regulations and restrictions could result in a loss of our ability to continue receiving reimbursement for remodulin 
we estimate that between of remodulin sales in the united states are reimbursed under the medicare and medicaid programs 
employees we had approximately employees as of february  we also maintain active independent contractor relationships with various individuals  most of whom are on month to month or annual consulting contracts 
we believe our employee relations are excellent

unless the context requires otherwise or unless otherwise noted  all references in this section to united therapeutics and to the company  we  us or our are to united therapeutics corporation and its subsidiaries 
risks related to our business actual consolidated revenues and net income may be different from published securities analyst projections 
in addition  we have a history of losses and may not continue to be profitable 
many independent securities analysts have published quarterly and annual projections of our revenues and profits 
these projections were made independently by the securities analysts based on their own analysis 
such estimates are inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty  particularly because we do not generally provide forward looking guidance to the public 
as a result  the actual revenues and net income may be greater or less than projected by such securities analysts 
even small variations in reported revenues and profits as compared to securities analysts expectations can lead to significant changes in our stock price 
although we have been profitable for every quarter ended after march   we lost money from the date of our inception in through march  at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
factors that could affect consolidated revenues and profitability and cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate include the following extent and timing of sales of remodulin to distributors  levels of remodulin inventory held by our distributors and changes to those levels from quarter to quarter  level of patient demand for remodulin and other products  status and impact of other approved competitive products such as ventavis  revatio  tracleer and flolan and investigational competitive products such as ambrisentan  thelin  cialis  gleevec  aviptadil and other potential investigational competitive products  changes in prescribers opinions about remodulin  impact of medical and scientific opinion about our products  levels of research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses  timing of payments to licensors and corporate partners  retention and growth of patients treated with remodulin  remodulin side effects  including impact of infusion site pain and reaction from subcutaneous use of remodulin and risk of line infections or sepsis relating to intravenous use of remodulin  changes in the current pricing and dosing levels of remodulin  changes in the length of time that remodulin vials may be used by patients  changes in the pricing of other therapies approved for pah  including possible generic formulations of other approved therapies  such as flolan  which may be sold in generic form beginning in may  the ability of our distributors to transition to the use of other infusion pumps currently available on the market due to medtronic s discontinuance of the c infusion pumps  willingness of private insurance companies  medicare and medicaid to reimburse remodulin at current pricing levels  impacts of new legislation and regulations and changes to the medicare and medicaid programs and their level of reimbursement of remodulin  our ability to maintain regulatory approval of remodulin in the united states and other countries  additional regulatory approvals for remodulin in countries other than where it is currently sold  continued performance by current remodulin distributors under existing agreements  size  scope and outcome of development efforts for existing and additional products  future milestone and royalty payments under license and other agreements  cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews  rate of technological advances  our ability  and our suppliers abilities  to establish  defend and enforce intellectual property rights  development of manufacturing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party manufacturing arrangements  the expected levels and timing of bulk purchases of advanced intermediate compounds and other chemicals used to manufacture treprostinil  the active ingredient of remodulin  establishment  continuation or termination of third party clinical trial arrangements  development of sales and marketing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party sales and marketing arrangements  impact of any regulatory restrictions on our marketing and promotional activities  recovery of goodwill  intangible assets and investments in affiliates  collection of accounts receivable and realization of inventories  risks associated with acquisitions  including the ability to integrate acquired businesses  unforeseen expenses  actual growth in sales of telemedicine and arginine products  actual expenses incurred in future periods  and completion of additional acquisitions and execution of licensing and technology development agreements 
most of our pharmaceutical products are in clinical studies 
we might not maintain or obtain regulatory approvals for our pharmaceutical products and may not be able to sell our pharmaceutical products commercially 
even if we sell our products  we may not be profitable and may not be able to sustain any profitability we achieve 
we may not successfully compete with established drugs and the companies that develop and market them 
we compete with established drug companies during product development for  among other things  funding  access to licenses  expertise  personnel  clinical trial patients  and third party collaborators 
we also compete with these companies following approval of our products 
almost all of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  clinical trials and regulatory matters than we do 
we are aware of existing treatments that compete with our products  especially in the field of pah 
patients and doctors may perceive these competing products to be safer  more effective  more convenient or less expensive than remodulin 
accordingly  sales of remodulin may not increase or may even decrease if doctors prescribe less remodulin than they are prescribing at present 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with many approved products in the united states and worldwide  including the following flolan was the first product approved by the fda for treating pah and has been marketed by glaxosmithkline plc since and  beginning in the second quarter of  by myogen  inc on october   myogen announced that it signed a merger agreement to be acquired by gilead sciences  inc  which is regarded as a large and successful biotechnology company in the united states 
generic formulations of flolan could be available for commercial sale as early as may flolan is delivered by intravenous infusion and considered to be an effective treatment by most pah experts 
ventavis was approved in december in the united states and in september in europe 
ventavis is the only prostacyclin that has been approved for inhalation  whereas remodulin is only currently approved to be delivered through intravenous or subcutaneous infusion 
ventavis was initially marketed by cotherix  inc in the united states and schering ag in europe 
in january  cotherix was acquired by actelion ltd  the manufacturer and distributor of tracleer  which is regarded as a successful biotechnology company 
tracleer  the first oral drug to be approved for pah  is also the first drug in its class  known as endothelin receptor antagonists 
tracleer was approved in december in the united states and may in europe 
tracleer is marketed by actelion ltd worldwide 
as an oral therapy  tracleer is a very convenient therapy  and revatio was approved in june in the united states 
revatio is also an oral therapy and is marketed by pfizer  inc revatio is a different formulation of the very successful drug viagra and is the first drug in its class  known as pde inhibitors  to be approved for pah 
doctors may reduce the dose of remodulin they give to their patients if they prescribe our competitors products in combination with remodulin 
in addition  certain of our competitors products are less invasive than remodulin and the use of these products may delay or prevent initiation of remodulin therapy 
finally  as a result of actelion s recent acquisition of cotherix  actelion now controls two of the five therapies approved for pah in the united states 
in addition to reducing competition through this consolidation  because actelion is dominant in the sales and marketing of oral pah therapies  it may bring its considerable influence with prescribers to the sales and marketing of ventavis 
many companies are marketing and developing products containing arginine that compete with our product line 
many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors provide cardiac holter and event monitoring services and systems that compete with our telemedicine products 
a number of drug companies are pursuing treatments for ovarian and other cancers and hepatitis that will compete with any products we may develop from our immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody platform and glycobiology antiviral agents platform 
discoveries or developments of new technologies by others may make our products obsolete or less useful 
other companies may make discoveries or introduce new products that render all or some of our technologies and products obsolete or not commercially viable 
researchers are continually making new discoveries that may lead to new technologies that treat the diseases for which our products are intended 
in addition  alternative approaches to treating chronic diseases  such as gene therapy  may make our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
other investigational therapies for pah could be used in combination with remodulin 
if this happens  doctors may reduce the dose of remodulin they give to their patients 
this could result in less remodulin being used by such patients and  hence  reduced sales of remodulin 
we are aware of investigational products being developed for the treatment of pah with which our products may have to compete 
remodulin and our other treprostinil based products may have to compete with investigational products currently being developed by other companies  including sitaxsentan thelin is being developed by encysive pharmaceuticals  inc encysive worldwide for the treatment of pah 
encysive has completed testing of thelin  an oral tablet  and  based on favorable results  has filed for approval with the fda in the united states 
in july  encysive announced that the fda determined that thelin was approvable with one substantive item remaining unresolved 
in december  encysive announced that the fda had accepted for review its complete response to its fda s july approvable letter 
in august  encysive announced that thelin received marketing authorization in all nations in the european union 
if approved in the united states  thelin would become the second drug available in the class known as endothelin receptor antagonists  ambrisentan is being developed by gilead sciences  inc for the treatment of pah 
ambrisentan  an oral tablet  has completed pivotal clinical testing and is also an endothelin receptor antagonist 
in february  gilead sciences announced that its new dug application for ambrisentan was accepted by the fda for six month priority review 
gilead sciences is regarded as a large and successful biotechnology company in the united states  cialis is an approved oral treatment for erectile dysfunction and is currently marketed by lilly icos llc  a joint venture of eli lilly and company and icos corporation 
cialis is currently being studied in patients with pah  and is in the same class of drugs as revatio 
on october   icos corporation announced that it signed a merger agreement to be acquired by eli lilly and company  which is a large and successful pharmaceutical company in the united states  gleevec is an approved oral treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia a cancer of the blood and bone marrow and is currently marketed by novartis pharmaceuticals corporation 
recently  researchers experienced in pah have conducted studies of gleevec and believe that it may be effective in treating pah  aviptadil  an inhaled formulation of vasoactive intestinal peptide  is being developed by mondobiotech holding sa  for the treatment of pah 
in september  mondobiotech announced that it had outlicensed aviptadil for the treatment of pah to biogen idec inc  which is regarded as a large and successful biotechnology company in the united states  prx  a serotonin receptor htb antagonist  is being developed by predix pharmaceuticals holdings  inc  as an oral tablet for the treatment of pah 
two phase i clinical trials of prx are being conducted in healthy volunteers  pulmolar is being developed by pr pharmaceuticals  inc it is a once a month injectible therapy which contains a metabolite of estradiol and has been shown in animal and cell models to address certain processes associated with pah  oral and inhaled formulations of fasudil  a rho kinase inhibitor  are being developed by actelion ltd for the treatment of pah 
fasudil is currently approved in japan as an intravenous drug to treat a disease unrelated to pah  sorafenib  marketed by bayer ag as nexavar for advanced renal cell cancer  is a small molecule which inhibits raf kinase and which may interfere with the thickening of blood vessel walls associated with pah 
a phase clinical trial in pah has been proposed  and recombinant elafin  being developed by proteo biotech ag  is a protein that is produced naturally in the body that may inhibit inflammatory reactions 
in february  elafin recently was granted orphan product status in the european union for the treatment of pah and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension 
there may be additional drugs in development for pah and there may also be currently approved drugs that may be effective in treating the disease 
if any of these drugs in development or other currently approved drugs are used to treat pah  sales of remodulin may fall 
if third party payers will not reimburse patients for our drug products or if third party payers limit the amount of reimbursement  our sales will suffer 
our commercial success depends heavily on third party payers  such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  agreeing to reimburse patients for the costs of our pharmaceutical products 
these third party payers frequently challenge the pricing of new and expensive drugs  and it may be difficult for distributors selling remodulin to obtain reimbursement from these payers 
remodulin and the associated infusion pump and supplies are very expensive 
we believe our investigational products  if approved  will also be very expensive 
presently  most third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin therapy 
in the past  medicare has not reimbursed the full cost of the therapy for some patients 
beginning on january   the medicare modernization act requires that we and the centers for medicare and medicaid services negotiate a new price for remodulin 
third party payers may not approve our new products for reimbursement or may not continue to approve remodulin for reimbursement  or may seek to reduce the amount of reimbursement for remodulin based on changes in pricing of other therapies for pah  including possible generic formulations of other approved therapies  such as flolan  which may be sold in generic form beginning in may if third party payers do not approve a product of ours for reimbursement or limit the amount of reimbursement  sales will suffer  as patients could opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement 
we rely on third parties to develop  market  distribute and sell most of our products and those third parties may not perform 
we are currently marketing products in three of our five therapeutic platforms remodulin in our prostacyclin analog platform  products in our arginine formulations platform  and cardiopal cardiac event monitors and holter monitors in our telemedicine platform 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical studies  obtain regulatory approvals  market  distribute or sell most of our products and intend to rely substantially on experienced third parties to perform all of those functions 
we may not locate acceptable contractors or enter into favorable agreements with them 
if third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we might not be able to obtain marketing approvals and sell our products 
until november   medtronic minimed was our exclusive partner for the subcutaneous delivery of remodulin using the minimed microinfusion device for pah 
medtronic had advised us that it intended to discontinue making infusion pumps for subcutaneous delivery of remodulin after first giving us and our distributors the opportunity to purchase desired quantities 
on november   we mutually agreed with minimed to terminate our contract 
we relied on medtronic minimed s experience  expertise and performance in supplying the infusion pumps 
any disruption in the supply to pah patients of infusion devices could delay or prevent patients from initiating or continuing remodulin therapy  which could adversely affect our revenues 
doctors and patients may not be able to obtain acceptable substitute delivery devices to replace the minimed microinfusion devises when the available supply held by our distributors has been depleted 
similarly  we rely on accredo therapeutics  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of medco health solutions  inc  curascript a wholly owned subsidiary of express scripts  inc and formerly priority healthcare corporation and caremark  inc which has agreed to merge with cvs corporation and is also an acquisition target of express scripts to market  distribute  and sell remodulin in the united states 
accredo  curascript and caremark are also responsible for convincing third party payers to reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin  which is very expensive 
if our distribution partners and contractors do not achieve acceptable profit margins  they may not continue to distribute our products 
if our distribution partners in the united states and internationally are unsuccessful in their efforts  our revenues will suffer 
during  two of our remodulin distributors in the united states were sold to larger companies 
more recently  in november  caremark announced its agreement to merge with cvs 
however  express scripts had also made an offer to acquire caremark 
if express scripts is successful in acquiring caremark  then it is possible that the remodulin distribution networks of caremark and express scripts will be combined  leaving us with two distributors in the united states 
together  they account for the majority of our remodulin sales 
when these distributors were independently managed  the remodulin franchise was a more significant business to them  because they were much smaller 
as divisions or subsidiaries of much larger companies  however  remodulin could be much less significant to these distributors 
there can be no assurance that a merger among our distributors will not adversely affect remodulin distribution 
in addition  we have been informed that  effective january   accredo will become the exclusive us distributor for flolan 
it is possible that our distributors may devote fewer resources to the distribution of remodulin 
if so  this may negatively impact our sales 
if we cannot maintain regulatory approvals for our products  we cannot sell those products and our revenues will suffer 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the manufacture  distribution  advertising and marketing of these products are subject to extensive regulation 
any new product approvals we receive in the future could include significant restrictions on the use or marketing of the product 
product approvals  if granted  can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements  including those relating to misleading advertising or upon the occurrence of adverse events following commercial introduction of the products 
we received one warning letter from the fda related to advertising in  which was resolved satisfactorily 
we rely heavily on sales of remodulin 
during the year ended december   our remodulin sales accounted for of our total revenues 
if approvals are withdrawn for remodulin or any other product  we cannot sell that product and our revenues will suffer 
in addition  if product approvals are withdrawn  governmental authorities could seize our products or force us to recall our products 
our products may not be commercially successful because physicians and patients may not accept them 
even if regulatory authorities approve our products  they may not be commercially successful 
we expect that most of our products  including remodulin  which is already approved by the fda  will be very expensive 
patient acceptance of and demand for our products will depend largely on the following factors acceptance by physicians and patients of our products as safe and effective therapies  willingness of payers to reimburse and the level of reimbursement of drug and treatment costs by third party payers such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  safety  efficacy  pricing and convenience of alternative products  convenience and ease of administration of our products  and prevalence and severity of side effects associated with our products  including the infusion site pain and reaction associated with the use of subcutaneous remodulin and the risk of line infections or sepsis associated with the use of intravenous remodulin 
reports of side effects  such as sepsis  associated with intravenous remodulin could cause physicians and patients to not accept remodulin or to cease to use remodulin in favor of alternative treatments 
sepsis is a serious and potentially life threatening infection of the bloodstream caused by a wide variety of bacteria 
intravenous prostacyclins are infused continuously through a catheter placed in patients chests  and sepsis is an expected consequence of this type of delivery 
as a result  sepsis is included as a risk in both the remodulin and flolan package inserts 
the flolan package insert specifically documents the risk rate of sepsis at events per patient per year  meaning one patient out of every three taking the drug is expected to have a sepsis infection each year 
or  each patient on flolan is expected to have one sepsis infection every three years 
the remodulin package insert notes that two of patients experienced catheter related infections in an open label week study  but does not provide any data relating to expected risk rate 
historical data on intravenous prostacyclin administration does not identify the specific types of bacteria responsible for these infections 
in february  the scientific leadership committee slc of the pulmonary hypertension association announced new guidance relating to the treatment of pah patients on long term intravenous therapy 
the slc guidance was issued in response to the release of a slide presentation prepared by researchers with the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc entitled bloodstream infections among patients treated with intravenous epoprostenol and intravenous treprostinil for pulmonary arterial hypertension  united states 
these slides accompanied a presentation to the slc and may subsequently be published as a report in the cdc s morbidity and mortality weekly report 
the slides were prepared in connection with a cdc retrospective inquiry at seven centers into a report of increased blood stream infections  particularly gram negative blood stream infections  among pah patients treated with intravenous remodulin as compared to intravenous flolan 
the slc guidance statement noted that the cdc observations were hypothesis generating and did not permit definitive or specific conclusions 
the slc reminded physicians of the need to be aware of the range of possible gram negative and gram positive infectious organisms in patients with long term central catheters and to treat them appropriately 
in response to the slc guidance statement  we are planning to commence a multi center  multi national  multi year and multi agent prospective study to scientifically test the hypothesis of whether there are differences in the risk of sepsis and sepsis sub types among parenterally delivered prostanoids 
we anticipate this study to enroll several hundred patients  which enrollment is expected to commence later this year 
we also plan to coordinate a working group with the pulmonary hypertension association and physicians and nurses  along with its network of specialty distributors and home health care providers  to develop unified best practice recommendations related to the chronic administration of iv prostanoids via central venous catheters 
finally  we will revise remodulin package labeling to more fully describe the known infection risk and appropriate technique that should be practiced when preparing and administering remodulin intravenously 
although the risk of sepsis is currently included in the remodulin label  and the occurrence of sepsis is familiar to physicians who treat pah patients  concern about bloodstream infections may adversely impact physicians prescribing practices in regard to remodulin 
if that occurs  remodulin sales could suffer and our profitability could be adversely impacted 
we have limited experience with production and manufacturing and depend on third parties  who may not perform  to synthesize and manufacture many of our products 
prior to our acquisition of synquest  inc  a company that manufactured treprostinil  the bulk active ingredient in remodulin  we had no experience with manufacturing 
presently  commercial treprostinil is being manufactured only by us with reliance on third parties for certain raw and advanced intermediate materials 
the ovarex material that is currently being used in our studies was made by a contract manufacturer and will expire in early in  we plan to make the ovarex antibody for the first time ourselves  in our new silver spring laboratory 
biological drugs are generally the most complex drugs to manufacture  and we have never attempted to manufacture them in house before 
after we manufacture our own ovarex  we must then demonstrate that it is comparable to the drug used in the phase iii clinical trials 
even if our ovarex trials are successful  we will not be able to obtain approval for ovarex unless we can demonstrate that the ovarex antibody we manufacture is comparable to the drug used in the trials 
if we cannot demonstrate the comparability prior to the expiration date  then we may have to repeat the ovarex trials with the new drug that we manufacture 
although the laboratory is completed and is occupied by our personnel  we are still performing test runs and finalizing procedures for our developmental production runs prior to our process scale up and validation production runs of ovarex 
in addition  we are working with our builders to complete or repair certain aspects of the laboratory 
we hope to commence process scale up and validation production of the ovarex antibody in early we rely on third parties for the manufacture of all our products other than treprostinil 
we rely on baxter healthcare corporation for the formulation of remodulin from treprostinil 
we rely on cardinal health  inc for conducting stability studies on remodulin  formulating treprostinil for inhalation use  formulating tablets for the oral clinical trials  and analyzing other products that we are developing 
we rely on msi of central florida  inc to manufacture our telemedicine devices 
we rely on other manufacturers to make our investigational drugs and devices for use in trials 
although there are few companies that could replace each of these suppliers  we believe that other suppliers could provide similar services and materials 
a change in suppliers  however  could cause a delay in distribution of remodulin and other products  and in the conduct of clinical trials and commercial launch  which would adversely affect our research and development efforts and future sales efforts 
our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks the manufacturing processes for some of our products have not been tested in quantities needed for commercial sales  delays in scale up to commercial quantities and process validation could delay clinical studies  regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products  a long lead time is needed to manufacture treprostinil and remodulin  and the manufacturing process is complex  we and the manufacturers and formulators of our products are subject to the fda s and international drug regulatory authorities good manufacturing practices regulations and similar international standards  and although we control compliance issues with respect to synthesis and manufacturing conducted internally  we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by our third party manufacturers  even if we and the manufacturers and formulators of our products comply with the fda s and international drug regulatory authorities good manufacturing practices regulations and similar international standards  the sterility and quality of the products being manufactured and formulated may be deficient 
if this occurred  such products would not be available for sale or use  if we have to change to another manufacturing or formulation contractor for any reason or abandon our own manufacturing operations  the fda and international drug regulators would require new testing and compliance inspections  and the new manufacturer would have to be educated in the processes necessary for the validation and production of the affected product 
we were recently notified that cardinal health intends to sell its formulation business and there can be no assurances that a purchaser of this business will continue formulating treprostinil for both our inhalation and oral clinical trials  we may not be able to develop or commercialize our products  other than remodulin  as planned or at all and may have to rely solely on internal manufacturing capacity  we are transferring our entire drug laboratory operations to the silver spring  maryland facility we recently built  and such transfer could result in manufacturing inefficiencies or delays because the building  equipment and many of the employees being deployed there will be new to the process of making our products 
additionally  the fda and international drug regulators will require new testing and compliance inspections for approval of the facility  and this could result in delays  the supply of raw and advanced intermediate materials and components used in the manufacture and packaging of treprostinil  remodulin and other products may be interrupted  which could delay the manufacture and subsequent sale of such products 
any proposed substitute materials and components are subject to approval by the fda and international drug regulators before any manufactured product can be sold 
the timing of such fda and international drug regulatory approval is difficult to predict and approvals may not be timely obtained  without substantial experience in operating our new production facility  we may not be able to successfully produce treprostinil without a third party manufacturer  and we may not have intellectual property rights  or may have to share intellectual property rights  to many of the improvements in the manufacturing processes or new manufacturing processes for our new products 
any of these factors could delay clinical studies or commercialization of our products  entail higher costs  and result in our inability to effectively sell our products 
if our products fail in clinical studies  we will not be able to obtain or maintain fda and international approvals and will not be able to sell those products 
in order to sell our pharmaceutical products  we must receive regulatory approvals 
to obtain those approvals  we must conduct clinical studies demonstrating that the drug product  including its delivery mechanism  is safe and effective 
if we cannot obtain approval from the fda and international drug regulators for a product  that product cannot be sold  and our revenues will suffer 
we are conducting a phase iii clinical study of viveta  an inhaled formulation of treprostinil  and phase ii iii clinical studies of an oral formulation of treprostinil 
our lead glycobiology antiviral agent  ut b  completed a phase ii  proof of concept study in late in that trial  ut b did not demonstrate efficacy against hepatitis c in a population of patients that previously failed conventional treatments 
we are now conducting preclinical testing of additional glycobiology drug candidates 
we are also currently conducting two identical phase iii pivotal studies of ovarex for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer 
we are still completing or planning pre clinical studies for our other products 
in the past  several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process  including  but not limited to immediate release beraprost  which failed in phase iii testing for early stage peripheral vascular disease  ketotop  which failed in phase iii testing for osteoarthritis of the knee  and ut  which failed in phase ii testing for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
also  the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied by product and by the intended use of a product 
we expect that this will likely be the case with future product candidates and we cannot predict the length of time to complete necessary clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval 
our ongoing and planned clinical studies might be delayed or halted for various reasons  including the drug is not effective  or physicians think that the drug is not effective  patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate we expect  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  other investigational or approved therapies are viewed as more effective or convenient by physicians or patients  patients die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  drug supplies are not available or suitable for use in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing cause delays in clinical trials 
in addition  the fda and international regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process 
the fda and international regulatory authorities may not agree that we have demonstrated that our products are safe and effective 
our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal  state and international regulations 
the development  manufacture  distribution  pricing  sales  marketing  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  are subject to extensive federal  state and international regulation 
while we have developed and instituted corporate compliance programs  we cannot ensure that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal  state and international regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  a range of actions could result  including  but not limited to  the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  including withdrawal of our products from the market  significant fines  exclusion from government healthcare programs  or other sanctions or litigation 
if the licenses  assignments and alliance agreements we depend on are breached or terminated  we would lose our right to develop and sell the products covered by the licenses  assignments and alliance agreements 
our business depends upon the acquisition  assignment and license of drugs and other products which have been discovered and initially developed by others  including remodulin and all of the other products in the prostacyclin platform  all of the products in the immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody platform  all of the products in the glycobiology antiviral agents platform  and all arginine based products 
under our product license agreements  we are granted certain rights to existing intellectual property owned by third parties subject to the terms of each license agreement  whereas assignment agreements transfer all right  title and ownership of the intellectual property to us  subject to the terms of each assignment agreement 
we have also obtained licenses to other third party technology to conduct our business 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to other third party technology to commercialize our early stage products 
this dependence has the following risks we may not be able to obtain future licenses  assignments and agreements at a reasonable cost or at all  if any of our licenses or assignments are terminated  we will lose our rights to develop and market the products covered by such licenses or assignments  the licenses and assignments that we hold generally provide for termination by the licensor or assignor in the event we breach the license or assignment agreement  including failing to pay royalties and other fees on a timely basis  in the event that glaxosmithkline terminates its assignment agreement or pfizer terminates its license agreement  we will have no further rights to utilize the assigned patents or trade secrets to develop and commercialize remodulin 
for the year ended december   sales of remodulin accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
glaxosmithkline or pfizer could seek to terminate the assignment or license  respectively  in the event that we fail to pay royalties based on sales of remodulin  and if licensors fail to maintain the intellectual property licensed or assigned to us as required by most of our license and assignment agreements  we may lose our rights to develop and market some or all of our products and may be forced to incur substantial additional costs to maintain the intellectual property ourselves or force the licensor or assignor to do so 
certain license and assignment agreements relating to our products may restrict our ability to develop products in certain countries and or for particular diseases and impose other restrictions on our freedom to develop and market our products 
when we acquire  license or receive assignments of drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others  we may receive rights only to develop such drugs or products in certain territories and not throughout the world 
for example  we do not have the right to market ovarex and all our other monoclonal antibody immunotherapies for sale in most of europe and the middle east  and we only have the rights to market beraprost for sale in the united states and canada 
in addition  provisions in our license and assignment agreements impose other restrictions on our freedom to develop and market our products 
for example  in assigning remodulin to us  glaxosmithkline retained an exclusive option and right of first refusal to negotiate a license agreement with us if we ever decide to license any aspect of the commercialization of remodulin anywhere in the world 
similarly  in connection with its licenses of beraprost to us  toray industries  inc obtained a right of first refusal from us to develop and sell in japan up to two compounds that we develop 
we also agreed to provisions giving toray industries the conditional right to approve our north american distributor  establishing a conditional restricted non competition clause  and requiring minimum annual sales in order to maintain our exclusive rights to beraprost  although we are currently negotiating with toray industries to restate some of these provisions 
the restrictions that we have accepted in our license and assignment agreements affect our freedom to develop and market our products in the future 
if our  or our suppliers  patent and other intellectual property protection is inadequate  our sales and profits could suffer or competitors could force our products completely out of the market 
our united states patent for the method of treating pah with remodulin is currently set to expire in october the patent for ovarex and its method of use are the subject of a combination of issued patents and pending applications in the united states and around the world 
the issued patents for ovarex have expiration dates ranging from to we believe that some of the patents to which we have rights may be eligible for extensions of up to five years based upon patent term restoration procedures in europe and under the hatch waxman act in the united states 
competitors may develop products based on the same active ingredients as our products  including remodulin  and market those products after the patents expire  or may design around our existing patents 
if this happens  our sales would suffer and our profits could be severely impacted 
in addition  if our suppliers intellectual property protection is inadequate  our sales and profits could be adversely affected 
patents may be issued to others that prevent the manufacture or sale of our products 
we may have to license those patents and pay significant fees or royalties to the owners of the patents in order to keep marketing our products 
this would cause profits to suffer 
we have been granted patents in the united states for the synthesis of remodulin  but patent applications that have been or may be filed by us may not result in the issuance of additional patents 
the scope of any patent issued may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
the laws of international jurisdictions in which we intend to sell our products may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technology advances 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and others  but these agreements may not be effective in protecting our proprietary information 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or obtain access to our know how 
litigation  which is very expensive  may be necessary to enforce or defend our patents or proprietary rights and may not end favorably for us 
while we have recently settled pending litigation against two parties related to our arginine patents  we may in the future choose to initiate litigation against other parties who we come to believe have violated our patents or other proprietary rights 
if such litigation is unsuccessful or if the patents are invalidated or canceled  we may have to write off the related intangible assets which could significantly reduce our earnings 
any of our licenses  patents or other intellectual property may be challenged  invalidated  canceled  infringed or circumvented and may not provide any competitive advantage to us 
if our highly qualified management and technical personnel leave us  our business may suffer 
we are dependent on our current management  particularly our founder and chief executive officer  martine rothblatt  phd  our president and chief operating officer  roger jeffs  phd  our chief financial officer and treasurer  john ferrari  our executive vice president for strategic planning  general counsel and corporate secretary  paul mahon  our executive vice president and chief operating officer for production  david walsh  phd  our senior vice president for pharmaceutical development  david zaccardelli  pharmd  and our senior vice president for biologics production  development and supply  james levin  dvm 
while these individuals are employed by us pursuant to multi year employment agreements  employment agreements do not ensure the continued retention of employees 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on these officers  although we do incentivize them to remain employed by the company until age through our supplemental executive retirement plan 
our success will depend in part on retaining the services of our existing management and key personnel and attracting and retaining new highly qualified personnel 
few individuals possess expertise in the field of cardiovascular medicine  infectious disease and oncology  and competition for qualified management and personnel is intense 
we may not have adequate insurance and may have substantial exposure to payment of product liability claims 
the testing  manufacture  marketing  and sale of human drugs involve product liability risks 
although we currently have product liability insurance covering claims up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate for our products  we may not be able to maintain this product liability insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all 
in addition  this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses 
if claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may go out of business 
we may not have  or may have to share rights to  future inventions arising from our license  assignment and alliance agreements and may lose potential profits or savings 
pursuant to our agreements with certain business partners  any new inventions or intellectual properties that arise from our activities will be owned jointly by us and these partners 
if we do not have rights to new developments or inventions that arise during the terms of these agreements  or we have to share the rights with others  we may lose some or all of the benefit of these new rights  which may mean a loss of future profits or savings generated from improved technology 
if we need additional financing and cannot obtain it  product development and sales may be limited 
we may need to spend more money than currently expected because we may need to change our product development plans or product offerings to address difficulties with clinical studies  to prepare for commercial sales or to continue sales of remodulin 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if additional funds are not available  we may be compelled to delay clinical studies  curtail operations or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets 
our activities involve hazardous materials  and improper handling of these materials could expose us to significant liabilities 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals and hazardous materials and we are expanding these activities to new locations 
as a consequence  we are subject to numerous federal  state  and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the management  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
we may be required to incur significant costs in order to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations  and substantial fines and penalties for failure to comply with those laws and regulations 
while we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with laws and regulations governing these materials  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be liable for civil damages that result or for costs associated with the cleanup of any release of hazardous materials  which could be substantial 
any such liability could exceed our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our common stock our stock price could be volatile and could decline 
the market prices for securities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including our company  are highly volatile  and there are significant price and volume fluctuations in the market that may be unrelated to particular companies operating performances 
our stock price could decline suddenly due to the following factors  among others quarterly and annual financial and operating results  failure to meet estimates or expectations of securities analysts or our projections  the pace of enrollment in and the results of clinical trials  physician  patient  investor or public concerns as to the efficacy and or safety of products marketed or being developed by us or by others  changes in or new legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement of remodulin by medicare or medicaid and changes in reimbursement policies of private health insurance companies  announcements by us or others of technological innovations or new products or announcements regarding our existing products  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  future sales of substantial amounts of common stock by us or our existing stockholders  future sales of common stock by our directors and officers  failure to maintain approvals to sell remodulin  the adoption of significant short positions in our common stock by hedge funds or other significant investors or the accumulation of our stock by hedge funds or other institutional investors with investment strategies that may lead to short term holdings  timing and outcome of additional regulatory approvals  and general market conditions 
future sales of shares of our common stock may depress our stock price 
if we issue common stock to raise capital  or our stockholders transfer their ownership of our common stock or sell a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market  or investors become concerned that substantial sales might occur  the market price of our common stock could decrease 
three of our four executive officers have announced their adoption of b prearranged trading plans 
in accordance with these plans  these executives periodically sell a specified number of our shares of common stock either owned by them or acquired through the exercise of stock options 
however  our executives and directors may choose to sell additional shares outside of b trading plans and one executive and five directors have done so 
in addition  toray industries has an option to acquire  shares of our common stock and piggyback registration rights with respect to such shares that arise if and when this option becomes exercisable 
a decrease in our common stock price could make it difficult for us to raise capital by selling stock or to pay for acquisitions using stock 
to the extent outstanding options are exercised or additional shares of capital stock are issued  existing stockholders may incur additional dilution 
furthermore  the conversion of some or all of our convertible secured notes due convertible notes after our stock price reaches per share will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
we have filed a resale registration statement covering sales of such shares 
the convertible notes initially are convertible into an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible notes could depress the price of our common stock 
the convertible note purchase call option and call warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of the convertible notes may affect the trading price of our common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into a privately negotiated convertible note hedge transaction with deutsche bank ag london  which is expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the convertible notes 
we also entered into a warrant transaction with deutsche bank ag london with respect to our common stock pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock 
in connection with hedging these transactions  deutsche bank ag london or its affiliates were expected to enter into various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock at  and possibly after  the pricing of the convertible notes and may have purchased or may purchase shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the convertible notes 
these activities could have had  or could have  the effect of increasing the price of our common stock 
deutsche bank ag london or its affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock  other of our securities or other instruments it may wish to use in connection with such hedging 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the convertible notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock including during any period used to determine the amount of consideration deliverable upon conversion of the convertible notes 
the fundamental change purchase feature of the convertible notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company 
the terms of the convertible notes require us to purchase the convertible notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change 
a takeover of our company would trigger the requirement that we purchase the convertible notes 
this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors 
provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws and shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay a change of control or change in management that could be beneficial to us and our public stockholders 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws and shareholder rights plan may prevent  delay or discourage a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities  and the replacement or removal of current management by our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation divides the board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected for staggered three year terms 
this provision may make it more difficult for stockholders to change the majority of directors and may hinder accumulations of large blocks of common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks 
this may further result in discouraging a change of control or change in current management 
we will need cash to pay at least a portion of the conversion value of the convertible notes  as required by the indenture governing the notes 
at least a portion of the repayment of the convertible notes will be required to be made in cash 
our product development plans and product offerings could be negatively impacted if we do not have sufficient financial resources  or are not able to arrange suitable financing  to pay required amounts upon conversion or tender of the notes and fund our operations 
our existing directors and executive officers own a substantial block of our stock and might be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval 
our directors and named executive officers beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december   including stock options that could be exercised by those directors and executive officers within days of that date 
accordingly  these stockholders as a group might be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of our directors 
such stockholder influence could delay or prevent a change of control with respect to us 
if stockholders do not receive dividends  stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain our earnings for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future

overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic products for patients with chronic and life threatening cardiovascular  cancer and infectious diseases 
we commenced operations in june and  since our inception  have devoted substantially all of our resources to acquisitions and research and development programs 
united therapeutics products and services our lead product is remodulin  a prostacyclin analog 
our prostacyclin analog acts as a stable synthetic form of prostacyclin  an important molecule produced by the body that has powerful effects on blood vessel health and function 
on may   the united states food and drug administration fda approved subcutaneous injection under the skin use of remodulin treprostinil sodium for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension pah in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
pah is a life threatening condition characterized by elevated blood pressures between the heart and lungs 
as a condition of remodulin s subpart h approval  we were required to perform a post marketing phase iv clinical study to confirm the clinical benefits of remodulin 
in august  we performed an interim assessment after patients completed the phase iv study 
the results of the interim assessment  as analyzed by an independent statistician  were positive 
the p value was  meaning the likelihood that the achieved result was incorrect was two out of ten thousand 
specifically  of the patients receiving remodulin were able to successfully transition from flolan  the other fda approved intravenous prostacyclin  which they had previously been using to treat their condition 
these patients were able to complete the study without the need to return to flolan 
in contrast  of the patients successfully transitioned without clinical deterioration during the eight week period from flolan to placebo 
based on this positive outcome  we submitted the interim study results to the fda in july with a supplement filed in october in march  the fda agreed that we had satisfied our obligation to perform the post marketing phase iv clinical study and that the study confirmed the clinical benefits of remodulin 
in november  the fda approved intravenous through a vein or artery infusion of remodulin for patients who are not able to tolerate subcutaneous infusion 
this approval was based on data establishing the bioequivalence of intravenous with subcutaneous remodulin 
in march  the fda also approved the use of remodulin for patients requiring transition from flolan 
remodulin has been approved for intravenous use in canada  israel  mexico  argentina and peru 
marketing authorization applications are currently under review in other countries 
remodulin is approved for subcutaneous use in countries throughout the world 
the mutual recognition process to obtain approvals from european union member countries for subcutaneous use of remodulin was completed in august  with positive decisions received from most european union countries 
we withdrew applications in ireland  spain and the united kingdom 
we anticipate resubmitting our application with these three countries at the same time we file our application for intravenous remodulin approval 
licenses and pricing approvals have been received in most european union countries  with the remainder expected during we have filed a variation to our license for approval of intravenous remodulin through the mutual recognition process 
currently  our application is under review in france  our reference member state in the mutual recognition process 
we have generated revenues from sales of remodulin and arginine royalties and products which deliver an amino acid that is necessary for maintaining cardiovascular function in the united states and other countries 
in addition  we have generated revenues from telemedicine products and services  primarily designed for patients in the united states with abnormal heart rhythms  called cardiac arrhythmias  and ischemic heart disease  a condition that causes poor blood flow to the heart 
we have funded our operations from the proceeds of sales of our common stock and from revenues generated from the sales of our products and services 
remodulin marketing and sales remodulin is currently marketed by our own internal marketing staff  which was made up of approximately employees as of december  our marketing team interacts directly with physicians and their staff  comprised mainly of cardiologists and pulmonologists  who specialize in treating pah 
we face stiff competition from several other companies that market and sell competing therapies  including large and successful biotechnology companies  and expect the competition to continue growing 
remodulin is sold to patients in the united states by accredo therapeutics  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of medco health solutions  inc  curascript a wholly owned subsidiary of express scripts  inc and formerly priority healthcare corporation  and caremark  inc  which has accepted an acquisition offer by cvs corp 
express scripts has also offered to purchase caremark 
if express scripts is successful in its attempt to purchase caremark  the possibility exists that the remodulin operations of curascripts and caremark could be combined 
remodulin is distributed outside of the united states by various international distributors 
we sell remodulin in bulk shipments to our distributors 
the us based distributors typically place one order per month  usually prior to the middle of the month 
the timing and magnitude of our sales of remodulin are impacted by the timing and volume of these bulk orders from distributors 
bulk orders placed by our distributors are based on their estimates of the amount of drug required for current and newly starting patients  as well as maintaining an inventory that can meet approximately thirty to sixty days demand as a contingent supply 
effective january   all of the us based distributors minimum inventory requirement must be days 
this inventory must be maintained in accordance with the distributors contractual obligations  because discontinuation of therapy can be life threatening to patients 
because of the contractual requirements for inventory maintenance  sales of remodulin to distributors in any given quarter may not be indicative of patient demand in that quarter 
in addition  inventory levels reported by distributors are impacted by the timing of their sales around the end of the reporting period 
sales of remodulin and associated pumps and supplies are recognized as revenue when delivered to our distributors 
effective july   united therapeutics increased the selling price of remodulin to its us based distributors 
the price was increased approximately to per milligram  and applies to sales of remodulin made on or after july  remodulin manufacturing we are in the process of transferring our treprostinil manufacturing operations from chicago  illinois  to our new facility in silver spring  maryland 
this transfer is expected to be completed during the first half of historically  we have made treprostinil beginning with basic compounds that were either manufactured by us or purchased from vendors  advancing these compounds through a complex chemical synthesis process 
we will be modifying our manufacturing process for treprostinil in our new facility to begin instead with advanced intermediate compounds 
advanced intermediate compounds are those compounds that are typically found at the later stages of our manufacturing process 
this change is being made to address anticipated future demand for treprostinil in both our clinical and commercial programs 
we have approved three vendors that have a greater manufacturing capacity to make these intermediate compounds than we have 
these vendors also have the ability to manufacture these compounds less expensively than if we did so ourselves 
as a result  we have begun receiving bulk shipments of these intermediate compounds from these vendors 
to the extent that these intermediate compounds will be used for research and development programs  the cost of these compounds will be expensed when received 
intermediate compounds that will be used for commercial purposes will be placed into raw materials inventory 
we anticipate that upon commercialization of oral treprostinil  the need for treprostinil diethanolamine  its active ingredient  will be greater than the need for treprostinil sodium  the active ingredient for remodulin and viveta 
as a result  the manufacturing process at the silver spring facility will consist of starting with the advance intermediate compound  making treprostinil diethanolamine and then converting that compound to treprostinil 
we believe that this will allow us the most flexibility and efficiency to meet future demands for both forms of active ingredients 
future prospects while we have been profitable in each quarter since april   we incurred net losses for all quarters from inception through march  at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
future profitability will depend on many factors  including the price  level of sales  level of reimbursement by public and private insurance payers  the impact of competitive products and the number of patients using remodulin and other currently commercialized products and services  as well as the results and costs of research and development projects 
major research and development projects our major research and development projects are focused on the use of treprostinil to treat cardiovascular diseases  immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies antibodies that activate a patient s immune response to treat a variety of cancers and glycobiology antiviral agents a novel class of small molecules that may be effective as oral therapies to treat infectious diseases  such as hepatitis  dengue fever  and japanese encephalitis 
cardiovascular disease projects subcutaneous use of remodulin was approved by the fda in may for the treatment of pah in nyha class ii iv patients to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
material net cash inflows from the sales of remodulin for pah commenced in may after we received fda approval 
remodulin is also approved in countries throughout the world for similar uses 
marketing authorization applications are currently under review in other countries 
in march  we commenced a week placebo controlled trial of intravenous remodulin in patients with pah to further assess the clinical benefits of remodulin 
the trial was conducted in india and was designed to enroll up to patients 
interim results of this trial were to be analyzed after  and patients completed the trial 
in august  after enrolling approximately patients  we suspended enrollment of new patients  per the recommendation of the trial s independent data safety monitoring board  a panel of independent experts 
preliminary results from the patients were positive p 
after weeks  patients who took remodulin walked  on average  meters further in a six minute time period than patients who took a placebo 
the six minute walk test is a typical benchmark test of cardiovascular health 
during and  independent clinical investigators in europe and the united states performed small uncontrolled trials of inhaled formulations of treprostinil in patients with pah 
in april  the european medicines agency granted an orphan designation of inhaled treprostinil for the treatment of pah and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension 
in june  lung rx  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  commenced a week placebo controlled trial of inhaled treprostinil in at least patients with pah who are also being treated with tracleer 
during the trial  dosing will be escalated to patient tolerance or a maximum equivalence of micrograms per session 
the primary end point of the trial is peak six minute walk improvement 
additional centers are being added to the study 
this trial  triumph  treprostinil inhalation used in the management of pulmonary hypertension  is currently being conducted at approximately centers in the united states and europe 
in may  the fda agreed to permit the inclusion of patients with pah who are also being treated with revatio  to expand the trial size to at least patients  and to permit the assessment of efficacy after patients have completed the trial 
we do not intend to conduct this interim efficacy assessment 
as a result  the triumph trial is expected to conclude when evaluable patients have completed the study  which is expected upon the enrollment of approximately patients overall 
as of december   approximately patients had been enrolled in this trial 
as of february   approximately patients have been enrolled in this trial 
we are developing an oral formulation of treprostinil  treprostinil diethanolamine 
during  we completed dosage studies of oral formulations of treprostinil in healthy volunteers 
we filed an investigational new drug application in january to perform an additional phase i healthy volunteer study 
in july  the european medicines agency announced that oral treprostinil had been granted orphan product status in the european union 
drugs with orphan status generally receive priority review of approval applications and may receive longer periods of protection against competition from generic drugs 
using technology licensed from supernus pharmaceuticals  inc  we have developed a sustained released formulation of oral treprostinil which achieves level blood concentrations of treprostinil  similar to that achieved with our subcutaneous and infusion therapies  for between and hours in normal volunteers 
this supports a two times a day dosing regimen in the ongoing clinical studies 
two multi national placebo controlled clinical trials of oral treprostinil in patients with pah commenced in october these trials are a combination of phase ii and phase iii trials  in which both dosing and efficacy will be studied 
during the trials  dosing will be escalated to patient tolerance or a maximum equivalence of nanograms per kilogram 
one trial  freedom c  is a week study of up to patients  with an interim assessment at patients  currently on background therapy using revatio or tracleer or a combination of both 
the second trial  freedom m  is a week study of up to patients with an interim assessment at patients  who are not on any background therapy 
both trials will be conducted at approximately centers in the united states and the rest of the world 
as of december   there were and patients enrolled in freedom c and freedom m  respectively 
as of february   there were and patients enrolled in freedom c and freedom m  respectively 
we are also developing a sustained release formulation of beraprost  an oral analog of prostacyclin  for pah 
we are currently awaiting receipt of clinical trial materials from our license partner  toray industries  and are in the process of negotiating with toray industries to restate our license agreement for this development program 
we incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  on remodulin development 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred on remodulin development 
cancer disease projects our monoclonal antibody immunotherapies were licensed in april from altarex medical corp 
ovarex is our lead product and is currently being studied in two identical phase iii clinical trials in advanced ovarian cancer stage iii and iv patients 
in january  we initiated two identical phase iii pivotal clinical trials of ovarex called impact i and ii 
patients enrolled in these studies have successfully completed front line therapy  consisting of surgery and chemotherapy 
we are conducting these studies at approximately centers throughout the united states 
in june  these trials were fully enrolled with patients 
the primary endpoint for these trials is the difference in time to disease relapse between patients treated with ovarex and patients receiving a placebo 
the study will not be stopped and the results obtained until each study has reached at least relapse events 
following relapse  patients will also be followed to assess survival rate 
as of december   the reported number of relapse events was and  respectively  in each of the trials 
we incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  on ovarex development 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred on ovarex development 
infectious disease projects our infectious disease program includes glycobiology antiviral drug candidates in the preclinical and clinical stages of testing 
the drugs in this program are being developed for a wide variety of viruses 
we completed acute and chronic phase i clinical dosing studies using ut b  for the treatment of hepatitis c  to assess safety in healthy volunteers in early we initiated phase ii clinical studies in patients infected with hepatitis c in july  and completed those studies in october in that trial  ut b did not demonstrate efficacy against hepatitis c in a population of patients that previously failed conventional treatments 
we are now conducting preclinical testing of these glycobiology drug candidates 
we incurred expenses of approximately  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  for our infectious disease programs 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred for infectious disease programs 
project risks due to the inherent uncertainties involved in the drug development  regulatory review and approval processes  the anticipated completion dates  the cost of completing the research and development and the period in which material net cash inflows from these projects are expected to commence are not known or estimable 
there are many risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of the unapproved products discussed above  including the following products may fail in clinical studies  hospitals  physicians and patients may not be willing to participate in clinical studies  hospitals  physicians and patients may not properly adhere to clinical study procedures  the drugs may not be safe and effective or may not be perceived as safe and effective  other approved or investigational therapies may be viewed as safer  more effective or more convenient  patients may experience severe side effects during treatment  patients may die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  other ongoing or new clinical trials sponsored by other drug companies or ourselves may reduce the number of patients available for our studies  patients may not enroll in the studies at the rate we expect  the fda  international regulatory authorities or local internal review boards may delay or withhold approvals to commence clinical trials or to manufacture drugs  the fda or international regulatory authorities may request that additional studies be performed  higher than anticipated costs may be incurred due to the high cost of contractors for drug manufacture  research and clinical trials  drug supplies may not be sufficient to treat the patients in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing may cause delays in clinical trials 
if these projects are not completed in a timely manner  regulatory approvals could be delayed and our operations  liquidity and financial position could suffer 
without regulatory approvals  we cannot commercialize and sell these products and  therefore  potential revenues and profits from these products could be delayed or impossible to achieve 
financial position cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments including all unrestricted and restricted amounts and all amounts classified as current and non current at december   were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to the net proceeds after repurchase of our common stock from the issuance of convertible senior notes of approximately million 
restricted marketable investments and cash pledged to secure our obligations under the synthetic operating lease discussed below under off balance sheet arrangement at december   totaled approximately million  as compared with approximately million at december  accounts receivable  net of allowances at december   were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase was due primarily to increased sales of remodulin 
prepaid expenses and other current assets at december   were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase was primarily due to the prepayment of assets to be used in operations during property  plant and equipment at december   were approximately million as compared to million at december  the increase was due to the purchase of land and a building adjacent to our silver spring  maryland  headquarters in may for approximately million  the purchase of land in research triangle park  north carolina  in june for approximately million  pre construction costs on our facility projects in maryland and north carolina of approximately million  and the purchase of laboratory equipment for the new laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland  of approximately million 
other intangible assets  net  at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the decrease was due primarily to the million impairment write down of the heartbar trade name  as commercial activities for that product were discontinued in january investments in affiliates at december   were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the decrease was due primarily to a decline in the fair market value of our investment in virexx medical corp 
formerly altarex medical corp  which we mark to market  based on quoted market prices since the investment is classified as an available for sale security 
other assets at december   were approximately million as compared to  at december  the increase was primarily due to capitalizing of offering costs and fees of approximately million related to the issuance of our offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes  net of amortization during the year 
deferred tax assets including amounts classified as current and non current at december   were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase was due to the reduction of approximately million of the valuation allowance on most of our deferred tax assets in accrued expenses at december   were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in accrued expenses for royalty fees of approximately million  and an increase in accrued bonuses of approximately million 
prior to  employee bonuses were paid in june and december of each year 
in  we changed the payment dates to september for the mid year bonuses and march for the year end bonuses 
other current liabilities at december   were approximately  as compared to none at december  the amount represents the remaining balance of a final draw received in may from wachovia development corporation under the synthetic operating lease agreements to fund the remaining cost of constructing the laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
notes payable increased approximately million during due to the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
total stockholders equity at december   was approximately million  as compared to million at december  for the twelve month period  we repurchased approximately million shares of our stock for million and paid a net cost of million for the derivative note hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes 
these costs were offset by approximately million of net income  million of proceeds from stock option exercises  million from the recognition of a tax benefit related to the use of net operating losses attributable to stock option deductions  and million from the recognition of stock option expense 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to growth in sales of remodulin to our distributors 
the following sets forth our revenues by source for the periods presented in thousands revenues for the years ended december  remodulin telemedicine services and products other products license fees total revenues for the year ended december  and  approximately and of our remodulin revenues  respectively  were earned from our three distributors located in the united states 
total revenues are reported net of estimated government rebates  prompt pay discounts and fees due to a distributor for services 
we pay government rebates to state medicaid agencies that pay for remodulin 
historically  we estimated our liability for such rebates based on the volume of remodulin dispensed to medicaid patients as reported to us by our distributors and the expected rebate per unit of remodulin as determined by us in accordance with federal guidelines 
since april   we have estimated our liability for such rebates based on the historical level of government rebates invoiced by state medicaid agencies relative to us sales of remodulin 
prompt pay discounts are offered on sales of remodulin if the related invoices are paid in full generally within days from the date of sale 
we estimated our liability for prompt pay discounts based on historical payment patterns 
fees paid to a distributor for services are estimated based on contractual rates for specific services applied to estimated units of service provided by the distributor for the period 
a roll forward of the liability accounts associated with estimated government rebates  fees to distributors for services  and prompt pay discounts as well as the net amount of reductions to revenues for these items are presented as follows in thousands years ended december  liability accounts  at beginning of period additions to liability attributed to sales in current period prior period payments or reductions attributed to sales in current period prior period liability accounts  at end of period net reductions to revenues research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses was due primarily to increased expenses for treprostinil related programs of approximately million  primarily in our oral program  the adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   which resulted in the recognition of employee stock option expense of approximately million  an increase in expenses of approximately million related to stock option expense for option grants to scientific advisory board members  and an increase in spending in our cancer program of approximately million 
these increases were offset by a reduction of approximately million in expenses associated with our infectious disease research program 
during  we purchased approximately million of advanced intermediate compounds  which were either used or earmarked for use in the production of clinical trial material for our oral program 
because these compounds are for research and development purposes  they were expensed during the year 
see major research and development projects above  for additional information regarding our research programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to approximately million of employee stock option expense related to our adoption of sfas no 
r 
also contributing to this expense increase were an increase in marketing related expenses of approximately million  representing an increase in marketing staff and marketing initiatives  an increase in non marketing related salaries mainly due to an increase in headcount and salary increases of approximately million and an increase in rent and other operating expenses  primarily due to the opening of the new laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland  of approximately million 
in december  fred hadeed  our executive vice president for business development  resigned from his position with the company 
in accordance with his employment contract  mr 
hadeed received a salary payout of two times his annual salary and the average bonus received over the last two years  as well as immediate vesting of all of his unvested stock option grants 
as a result  in december  we recognized a cash salary expense of approximately million and a non cash stock option expense of approximately million  representing  options which were immediately vested 
an impairment of intangible assets related to the heartbar product trade name totaling approximately million was recorded during the year ended december  this impairment was required since the heartbar product was discontinued in january and is no longer sold 
the decision to discontinue heartbar did not impact other aspects of our arginine business  which includes sales of non heartbar arginine products and license royalties from third parties selling arginine based products 
we made this decision after evaluating the recent clinical trial results and market potential  among other things 
cost of product sales was approximately of net product sales for the year ended december   which is consistent with approximately for the year ended december  cost of service sales was approximately of service sales for the year ended december   as compared to approximately for the year ended december  the improvement in the cost of service sales as a percentage of service revenues was due to the growth in telemedicine service sales during  with no corresponding increase in costs  as a result of staffing and scheduling efficiencies 
interest income for the year ended december   was approximately million  as compared to interest income of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in cash available for investing during and increased market interest rates 
equity loss in affiliate represents our share of northern therapeutics losses 
the equity loss in affiliate was approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to approximately  for the year ended december  northern therapeutics loss was due primarily to expenditures for its cell based gene transfer technology research for pah 
an income tax benefit of approximately million was recognized for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the benefit in was due to an approximately million reduction in the valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets as of december  the reduction of the valuation allowance is based on our review of both historical and projected taxable income which has shown that it is more likely than not that certain portions of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
as a result  a reduction of the valuation allowance related to our net operating loss carry forwards  all of our business credits and other temporary assets was required 
the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million is on those deferred tax assets that need either a capital gain to occur in order to be recognized or profits from our affiliate northern therapeutics 
because these events are not likely to occur in the near future  the realizability of these assets is not more likely than not and we continue to maintain a valuation allowance 
prior to  due to the company s long history of operating losses  we did not believe our deferred tax assets had a realizable value and they were fully reserved 
as a result  we did not report tax benefits or deferred tax assets prior to in  we reduced the valuation reserve by approximately million 
years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to growth in sales of remodulin to our distributors 
the following sets forth our revenues by source for the periods presented in thousands 
revenues for the years ended december  remodulin telemedicine services and products other products license fees total revenues for the years ended december  and  approximately and of our revenues  respectively  were earned from three customers located in the united states 
total revenues are reported net of estimated government rebates  prompt pay discounts and fees due to a distributor for services 
we pay government rebates to state medicaid agencies that pay for remodulin 
historically  we estimated our liability for such rebates based on the volume of remodulin dispensed to medicaid patients as reported to us by our distributors and the expected rebate per unit of remodulin as determined by us in accordance with federal guidelines 
since april   we have estimated our liability for such rebates based on the historical level of government rebates invoiced by state medicaid agencies relative to sales of remodulin in the united states 
prompt pay discounts are offered on sales of remodulin if the related invoices are paid in full generally within days from the date of sale 
we estimated our liability for prompt pay discounts based on historical payment patterns 
fees paid to a distributor for services are estimated based on contractual rates for specific services applied to estimated units of service provided by the distributor for the period 
a roll forward of the liability accounts associated with estimated government rebates  prompt pay discounts and fees to a distributor for services as well as the net amount of reductions to revenues for these items are presented as follows in thousands years ended december  liability accounts  at beginning of period additions to liability attributed to sales in current period prior period payments or reductions attributed to sales in current period prior period liability accounts  at end of period net reductions to revenues our distributors endeavor to maintain levels of remodulin inventories sufficient to satisfy existing and new demand for the product 
inventory levels held by us based distributors as reported to us by our distributors at december  and were approximately million and million  respectively  based on our gross selling price 
as remodulin was only recently approved by certain european union member countries  inventory levels outside of the united states were not believed to be significant 
in the future  we expect that international sales will increase as remodulin is commercialized in more countries 
due to the inherent difficulties in tracking inventories held by our six international distributors and their numerous sub distributors  inventory information will not be reported in our periodic reports in the future 
product returns were due to arginine products and totaled approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased expenses of million for the remodulin related programs and million for the cancer disease programs during the year ended december   as compared to lower expenses for the year ended december  see major research and development projects above  for additional information regarding our research programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel  office expenses  insurance  professional fees  provision for doubtful accounts receivable  depreciation and amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the payment of one time application fees of approximately million to european countries as part of the mutual recognition process for remodulin approval  and a subsequent filing for approval of intravenous remodulin in europe 
also contributing were increases in salary and related expenses of approximately million  during the year ended december  cost of sales consists of the cost to manufacture or acquire products that are sold to customers 
cost of service sales consists of the salaries and related overhead necessary to provide services to customers 
cost of product sales was approximately of product sales for each of the years ended december  and cost of service sales was approximately of service sales for the year ended december   as compared to approximately for the year ended december  the improvement in the cost of service sales as a percentage of service revenues was due to the growth in service sales during with no corresponding increase in costs 
interest income for the year ended december   was approximately million  as compared to interest income of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in cash available for investing during and increased market interest rates 
equity loss in affiliate represents our share of northern therapeutics losses

an income tax benefit of approximately million was recognized for the year ended december   as compared to none for the year ended december  the benefit in was due to an approximately million reduction in the valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets as of december  the reduction of the valuation allowance is based on our review of both historical and projected taxable income which has shown that it is more likely than not that certain portions of our deferred tax assets will be realizable and that a reduction of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss carryforwards  business credits and intangible assets capitalized for tax purposes of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  was required 
the benefit from the reduction of the valuation allowance was offset by state income tax expenses and federal alternative minimum income tax expense totaling approximately  additionally  the use of approximately million of state net operating loss carryforwards were attributable to stock option deductions which is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital 
the deferred tax assets may be expensed in future periods as a component of tax expense as we incur additional taxable income 
prior to  due to the company s long history of operating losses  we did not believe our deferred tax assets had a realizable value and they were fully reserved 
as a result  we did not report tax benefits or deferred tax assets prior to liquidity and capital resources until june  we financed our operations principally through private placements of common stock 
on june   we completed our initial public offering 
our net proceeds from the initial public offering and sale of the over allotment shares  after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses  were approximately million 
in  we issued common stock in two private placements and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
until  we funded the majority of our operations from such net proceeds of equity 
since may  we have funded our operations from revenues  mainly remodulin related  and this is expected to continue 
we believe that our existing revenues  together with existing capital resources comprised primarily of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  will be adequate to fund our operations 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
see item a risk factors actual consolidated revenues and net income may be different from published securities analyst projections 
in addition  we have a history of losses and may not continue to be profitable 
in february  we filed a primary shelf registration statement with the sec to enable us to offer and sell up to five million shares of our common stock from time to time in one or more offerings 
the shelf registration statement was withdrawn in march and is no longer effective

approximately million  representing excess funds in escrow  will be taken out of the escrow account in early net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  excluding the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation of million  for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to growth in sales and collections of remodulin 
for the year ended december   we invested approximately million in cash for property  plant and equipment mainly for new properties  equipment for the new facility in silver spring  maryland  and pre construction related expenses  of approximately million  million and million  respectively as compared to approximately million in the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we received approximately million and million in stock option exercise proceeds  respectively 
we are currently in the planning phase for building a new approximately  square foot facility in research triangle park  north carolina  which will house a manufacturing operation and offices 
the manufacturing operation will be for formulating oral treprostinil and the offices will be used by our clinical development and sales and marketing staff  which currently occupies a leased facility in the area 
construction of this facility is expected to begin in early  may cost up to million  and may take up to two years to complete  although the cost and timetable for construction is still being determined 
we expect to fund the construction of this facility from our working capital 
we are also in the planning phase for a new office and laboratory building  which will connect to our current laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
the building of this facility is anticipated to begin in the latter half of the costs are still being estimated due to continuing design and related estimation work 
we anticipate that the construction of this facility will be financed though a synthetic operating lease 
we made milestone payments totaling  pursuant to existing license agreements during each of the years ended december  and we are obligated to make royalty payments on sales of remodulin that exceed annual net sales of million and on all arginine products 
royalties on sales of all products currently marketed range up to of sales of those products and up to of arginine royalty payments received 
convertible senior notes on october   we issued million of convertible senior notes due october the convertible senior notes 
proceeds from the offering  after deducting the initial purchaser s  deutsche bank securities inc deutsche bank  discount and commission and estimated expenses were approximately million 
the convertible senior notes were issued at par value and pay interest in cash semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on april  the convertible senior notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the convertible senior notes have an initial conversion price of per share 
the convertible senior notes may only be converted i anytime after july   ii during any calendar quarter commencing after the date of original issuance of the notes  if the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter preceding the quarter in which the conversion occurs is more than of the conversion price of the notes in effect on that last trading day  iii during the ten consecutive trading day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes for each such trading day was less than of the closing sale price of our common stock on such date multiplied by the then current conversion rate  or iv if specified significant distributions to holders of our common stock are made  specified corporate transactions occur  or our common stock ceases to be approved for listing on the nasdaq global select market and is not listed for trading on another us national or regional securities exchange 
upon conversion  a holder will receive i cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value  and ii to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note  shares of our common stock 
in addition  upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture under which the convertible senior notes have been issued  the holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible senior notes for of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  plus a number of additional shares of our common stock  as set forth in the related indenture 
the indenture under which the convertible senior notes were issued contains customary covenants 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we purchased call options on our common stock in a private transaction 
the call options allow us to receive up to approximately million shares of its common stock from counterparties  equal to the amount of common stock related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the convertible senior notes upon conversion 
these call options will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity dates of the related convertible senior notes or the first day all of the related convertible senior notes are no longer outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
the call options  which cost approximately million  will be recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
the cost of call option for tax purposes creates a tax deduction since it is classified as original issue discount oid 
the deduction is considered a permanent difference and as such does not create a deferred tax asset 
the benefit of deduction is recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
in a separate transaction  we sold warrants to issue shares of its common stock at an exercise price of per share 
pursuant to this transaction  warrants for approximately million shares of our common stock were issued 
if the average price of our common stock during a defined period  ending on or about the respective settlement dates  exceeds the exercise price of the warrants  the warrants will be settled in shares of our common stock 
proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately million and were recorded as an addition to additional paid in capital 
we also used approximately million to repurchase approximately million outstanding shares of our common stock as part of this transaction 
we intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital or other general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions  strategic investments or joint venture arrangements 
stock repurchases in july  in a privately negotiated transaction  we repurchased  shares of our common stock  par value per share  from toray industries for a cash purchase price of approximately million or per share  pursuant to a stock purchase agreement between toray industries and us 
the purchase price was the average of the closing prices of our common stock for the consecutive trading days ending on july  toray industries retains ownership of  shares of our common stock 
due to our desire to return value to our shareholders  on october   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock over a two year period 
as of december   a total of approximately million shares were repurchased at a cost of approximately million 
approximately million shares of our stock were repurchased using approximately million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior notes  based on the closing price of the common stock on october  of 
the remaining shares were repurchased on the open market under a structured repurchase program in which buy orders that are automatically placed at preset prices below the market open of stock 
the program has daily share limits as well as quarterly share and or dollar limits 
we may also repurchase shares outside of this program 
income taxes we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  due primarily to our expectation of incurring taxable income during at december   we had  for federal income tax purposes  net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and business tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire at various dates from through the majority of the net operating loss carryforwards is attributable to exercised stock options  the benefit of which was realized as direct increases in additional paid in capital 
business tax credits can offset future tax liabilities and arise from qualified research expenditures 
we have been and may continue to be subject to federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes  even though we have significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
section of the internal revenue code limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes occur as defined by that section 
we have reviewed our ownership change position through december  pursuant to section and have determined that ownership changes occurred in december  june  and november and  as a result  the utilization of certain of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
we are currently reviewing our ownership change position through december  we do not expect any significant portion of our net operating loss carry forwards or business tax credits to expire unused 
we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  due primarily to approximately million and million respective reductions in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on our determination that certain of these deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable 
off balance sheet arrangement in june  we entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia development corporation and its affiliates wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
under these agreements  wachovia funded million towards the construction of the laboratory facility on land owned by us 
the construction phase commenced in and was completed in may following construction  wachovia leased the laboratory facility to us with a term ending in may under the year ground lease  wachovia will pay fair value rent to us for use of the land both during the construction phase and after the laboratory lease is terminated 
during the term of the laboratory lease  wachovia will pay per year to us for use of the land 
wachovia receives rents from us  generally based on applying the day libor rate plus approximately basis points to the amount funded by wachovia towards the construction of the laboratory 
these monthly rents commenced when the laboratory construction was completed and will continue until the termination of the lease in may upon termination of the lease  we will generally have the option of renewing the lease subject to approval of both parties  purchasing the laboratory at a price approximately equal to the funded construction cost  or selling it and repaying wachovia the cost of its construction 
we have guaranteed that if the laboratory is sold  wachovia will receive at least of the amount it funded towards the construction 
we pledged a portion of our marketable investments as collateral to secure our lease obligations 
at december   approximately million of marketable investments and cash were pledged as collateral and are reported as restricted marketable investments and cash in our consolidated balance sheet 
this arrangement enabled us to construct our laboratory facility without using our own working capital 
there will not be any depreciation expense associated with the laboratory facility  since these improvements are owned by wachovia 
the amount of rent to be paid to wachovia during the term of the laboratory lease will vary as it is tied to the then current day libor rate plus approximately basis points 
as this rate increases  so will the rents to be paid 
similarly  if this rate decreases  then the amount of rent to be paid to wachovia will also decrease 
rent payments under the laboratory lease commenced in may after completion of construction and will continue through termination of the lease in may upon the completion of the building in may  wachovia advanced to us the remaining funds available  approximately million for construction due to the lengthy process involved in finalizing construction costs 
when the final construction costs have been agreed upon  any remaining funds that were advanced will be returned to wachovia 
we anticipate that the finalization of construction costs will be completed in late until then  the rent payments will be based on the full million lease facility 
upon the return of unspent funds  the remaining rent payments will be based on the actual funded costs of the building 
at december   the remaining construction advance totaled approximately  and is classified as other current liability in the balance sheet 
based on construction costs of approximately million and the current effective rate of approximately equivalent to the current day libor rate plus approximately basis points at december   the rents to be paid are approximately million annually 
in addition  wachovia paid us ground rent in june covering the period through may and totaled an aggregate of approximately  this amount is being recognized as income ratably through may we guaranteed a minimum residual value of the laboratory facility 
this guaranteed residual is generally equal to of the amount funded by wachovia towards construction 
if  at the end of the lease term  we do not renew the lease or purchase the improvements  then the building will be sold to a third party 
in that event  we have guaranteed that wachovia will receive at least this residual value amount 
the maximum potential amount of this guarantee is approximately million  equivalent to of total expected construction costs of million 
we have reported this guarantee as a non current asset prepaid rent and non current liability other liability 
we have estimated the fair value of this guarantee liability and the corresponding asset at approximately  net of accumulated amortization at december  in october  we amended the laboratory lease to eliminate a covenant that we maintain a consolidated current debt ratio of not less than the laboratory lease and other agreements continue to require  among other things  that we maintain a consolidated net worth of at least million 
the agreements contain other covenants and conditions with which we must comply throughout the lease periods and upon termination of the lease 
if we were unable to comply with these covenants and conditions  if the noncompliance went uncured  and if the parties could not agree otherwise  the agreements could terminate 
a termination of these agreements could result in our acquisition of the improvements from wachovia or the loss of our liquid collateral 
in march  we entered into a construction management agreement with turner construction company turner under which turner became responsible for the construction of the facility 
the agreement contains a guaranteed maximum price clause in which turner agreed that the construction cost of the facility will not exceed approximately million  which amount is subject to change based on agreed upon changes to the scope of work 
turner is responsible for covering any costs in excess of the guaranteed maximum price guarantee 
contractual obligations at december   we had contractual obligations coming due approximately as follows in thousands payment due in total to to and later notes payable and capital lease obligations operating lease obligations construction agreement purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected in the statement of financial position milestone payments in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
the principal balance of the notes is repaid in cash with any increase of our stock price above paid in our stock 
while the notes can be redeemed by the bondholder once our stock price exceeds  we have assumed that the bondholders will hold the bonds until maturity 
upon the completion of the laboratory in may  wachovia advanced to us the remaining funds available for construction due to the lengthy process involved in finalizing construction costs 
when the final construction costs have been agreed upon  any remaining funds that were advanced will be returned to wachovia 
at december   the remaining construction advance totaled approximately  and is classified as other current liability in the balance sheet 
upon termination of the lease with wachovia for the laboratory facility  we will generally have the option of renewing the lease  purchasing the laboratory or selling it and repaying wachovia the cost of its construction 
we guaranteed that if the laboratory is sold  wachovia will receive at least of the amount it funded towards the construction 
we estimate that the laboratory will cost approximately million to construct and the guarantee is estimated at approximately million 
the estimated fair value of the guarantee is included in other long term liabilities reflected in the statement of financial position 
see off balance sheet arrangement for additional information 
we licensed certain products from other companies under certain license agreements 
these agreements generally include milestone payments to be paid in cash by us upon the achievement of certain product development and commercialization goals set forth in each license agreement 
total milestone payments under these license agreements have been estimated based on the estimated timing of these development and commercialization goals 
summary of critical accounting policies income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a net deferred tax asset or liability is reported in the balance sheet 
at each reporting date  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset is realizable 
if the net deferred tax asset is not fully realizable  then a valuation allowance is established to reduce the amount of net deferred tax assets reported in the balance sheet 
based on the weight of available evidence at december   it was determined that a partial valuation allowance totaling approximately million was necessary at december  remodulin revenue recognition product sales of remodulin are recognized when delivered to distributors  which comprise our customers for remodulin 
product sales of remodulin delivery pumps and related supplies are recognized when delivered to distributors on a gross basis in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
title to these products passes upon delivery 
had the net basis been applied  the amounts of revenues and cost of product sales reported in the consolidated financial statements would have been lower  but there would have been no impact on net income or losses 
prompt payment discounts  government rebates and fees to a distributor are estimated and recognized as reductions of revenue in the same period that revenues are recognized 
had these discounts  rebates and fees not been reported as reductions of revenue  the amounts reported as revenues and selling expenses would have been higher  but there would have been no impact on net income or losses 
return policies provide that product that has expired or become damaged in shipment may be replaced  but not returned 
therefore  reserves for exchanges are not recorded unless product expiration or damage occurs 
the shelf life of remodulin is two and one half years from the date of its manufacture 
we rely on our distributors to report damage in shipment or expirations of remodulin product 
one of our remodulin distribution agreements stipulated minimum quarterly purchases by the distributor for periods through june   and no minimum quarterly purchases after june  the distribution agreement  however  does not permit the distributor to return remodulin product solely based on the distributor s ability or inability to resell the product 
as a result  revenues from sales to this distributor are recognized in the period that the remodulin product is delivered to the distributor 
during the years ended december   and  approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of remodulin products were sold to this distributor and recognized as revenue  respectively  and this distributor has made voluntary purchases since june  we closely monitor levels of inventory in the distribution channel for contractual compliance 
the shelf life associated with our products is months 
obsolescence due to dating expiration has not been a historical concern  given the rapidity in which our products move through the channel 
changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us 
we do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in the ordinary course of business 
united therapeutics records remodulin and related product sales net of the following significant categories of product sales allowances prompt payment discounts  medicaid discounts  and fees paid to distributors 
calculating each of these items involves significant estimates and judgments and requires united therapeutics to use information from external sources 
prompt payment discounts united therapeutics offers its distributors a prompt pay cash discount as an incentive to remit payment within the first thirty days after the date of the invoice 
prompt pay discount calculations are based on the gross amount of each invoice 
these discounts are accounted for by reducing sales by the discount amount when product is sold  and applying earned cash discounts at the time of payment 
united therapeutics customers have routinely taken advantage of this discount 
based on common industry practices and on distributors overall payment history  united therapeutics accrues for cash discounts on all remodulin product sales recorded during the period unless information is available  such as an outstanding invoice  which would indicate that the invoice will not be paid within the discount period 
united therapeutics adjusts the accrual to reflect actual experience as necessary and  as a result  the actual amount recognized in any period may be slightly different from the accrual amount 
medicaid discounts united therapeutics records accruals for rebates to be provided through governmental rebate programs  such as the medicaid drug rebate program  as a reduction of sales when product is sold 
these reductions are based on historical rebate amounts and trends of sales eligible for these governmental programs for a period  as well as any expected changes to the trends of its total product sales 
in addition  united therapeutics estimates the expected unit rebate amounts to be used and adjusts the rebate accruals based on the expected changes in rebate pricing 
rebate amounts are generally invoiced and paid a quarter in arrears  so that the accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  and an estimated accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates 
intangible assets we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test that is performed on october st of each year 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
at december   we believed that goodwill was not impaired and therefore no impairment losses have been recorded 
this conclusion is based on our judgment  taking into consideration expectations regarding future profitability and the status of the reporting units which have reported goodwill 
however  changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
on january   we decided to discontinue the sales  marketing and production of our heartbar line of products  which are arginine enriched dietary supplements 
this discontinuance was effective immediately 
the decision to discontinue heartbar is not meant to impact other aspects of our arginine line of business  which include sales of non heartbar arginine products and licensing royalties from third parties selling arginine based products 
this decision was made by us after evaluating recent clinical trial results and market potential  among other considerations 
in connection with this discontinuance  we concluded that we will recognize non cash impairment charges totaling approximately million from the write off of the heartbar trademark intangible 
these impairment charges were recorded in the quarter ending march  the other intangible assets related to the arginine line of business  primarily patents  are not affected by this discontinuance 
marketable investments currently  we invest portions of our cash in marketable debt securities issued primarily by federally sponsored agencies 
due to our intent and ability to hold these marketable debt investments until their maturities  these investments are reported at their amortized cost 
we believe that we are able to hold these investments to maturity  due to the significant level of cash and cash equivalents that we have 
if we did not have the ability and intent to hold these investments to maturity  we would have reported them in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair market values 
at december   the amortized cost of these debt securities was approximately million and their fair values were approximately million 
stock options effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized in includes compensation cost for all equity based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january  this estimation is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
and compensation cost for all equity based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
we have utilized the black scholes merton valuation model for estimating the fair value of the stock options granted during the year ended december   as well as for option grants during all prior periods 
the black scholes merton valuation model includes many assumptions that are subject to substantial judgments  such as risk free rate of interest  expected dividend yield  expected volatility  expected term of options and expected forfeiture rate 
expected volatility volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated historical volatility or is expected to fluctuate expected volatility during a period 
united therapeutics uses the historical volatility based on the weekly price observations of its common stock during the period immediately preceding the share based award grant that is equal in length to the award s expected term up to a maximum of five years 
united therapeutics believes that historical volatility within the last five years represents the best estimate of future long term volatility 
risk free interest rate this is the average interest rate consistent with the yield available on a us treasury note with a term equal to the expected term of the underlying grants at the date the option was granted 
expected term of options this is the period of time that the options granted are expected to remain outstanding 
united therapeutics adopted sab s simplified method for estimating the expected term of share based awards granted during the year ended december  expected dividend yield united therapeutics has never declared or paid dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
as such  the dividend yield percentage is assumed to be zero 
expected forfeiture rate this is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled on an annual basis before becoming fully vested 
united therapeutics estimates the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeiture experience for similar levels of employees to whom options were granted 
investments in affiliates the equity method of accounting is used to account for some of our investments in affiliates  including northern therapeutics 
the equity method of accounting generally requires that we report our share of our affiliates net losses or profits in our financial statements  but does not require that assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses of the affiliates be consolidated with our consolidated financial statements 
the equity method of accounting is being applied generally due to the lack of control over these affiliates and the levels of ownership held by us 
although our investment in northern therapeutics exceeds  minority shareholders possess substantive participating rights that preclude northern therapeutics financial statements from being consolidated 
other investments in affiliates are accounted for on the cost method generally due to the lack of significant influence over these affiliates and a less than ownership by us 
the cost method of accounting does not require that we report our share of the affiliates net losses or profits in our financial statements  nor are affiliates assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses consolidated with our consolidated financial statements 
options issued in exchange for license in june  in connection with our license from toray industries for the sustained release formulation of beraprost an oral prostacyclin analog  we agreed to grant options to toray industries to purchase  shares of our common stock upon toray industries adequate documentation of sustained release beraprost in humans and its transfer of clinical trial material for use in clinical trials in the united states 
these options will not be priced until toray industries has met this milestone 
if and when the milestone is met  the exercise price of the options will be set at the fair market value of our common stock at that time 
due to the uncertainties in drug development  it is not yet known if toray industries will provide the appropriate clinical trial material 
therefore  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees  these options are measured at their lowest aggregate fair value at each interim reporting date  which amount has been zero 
as a result  no expense related to these options has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
lease of laboratory facility in june  we entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
the construction of the laboratory facility was completed in may the total amount of the construction is expected to be million 
the laboratory facility is owned by wachovia  the lessor 
we are the lessee and pay rent to wachovia now that the facility is completed 
this arrangement is a form of off balance sheet financing under which wachovia funded of the costs for the construction of the property and now leases the laboratory facility to us 
we have provided a residual value guarantee to wachovia that the residual value of the leased assets will be at least equal to a specified amount at lease termination 
in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for leases  eitf issue no 
 implementation issues in accounting for lease transactions  including those involving special purpose entities  eitf issue no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  we determined that the lease is properly classified as an operating lease for accounting purposes 
furthermore  we determined that wachovia has sufficient substance such that it can be treated as an unrelated entity and  accordingly  does not require consolidation into our financial statements 
operating leases of assets do not require that the leased asset and the related rent obligation be reported in the lessee s balance sheet  but rather be disclosed as future commitments 
in contrast  capital leases do require that the leased asset and rent obligations be reported in the lessee s balance sheet as assets and debt 
changes in the levels of investment made by wachovia and its affiliates in the laboratory could affect the classification of the lease from operating to capital 
in that event  we would include both the assets and debt associated with the laboratory facility on our balance sheet

hybrid financial instruments in february  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments which amends sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
sfas also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of sfas and sfas sfas is effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning after september  united therapeutics does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas also carries forward without change the guidance contained in apb for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not a change in accounting principle 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by sfas sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  united therapeutics does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

sab becomes effective for accounting years ending after november  the adoption of this sab did not have any impact on united therapeutics financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   a substantial portion of our assets was comprised of debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies 
the market value of these investments fluctuates with changes in current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to decrease 
likewise  as rates decrease  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to increase 
to minimize such market risk  we hold such instruments to maturity at which time these instruments will be redeemed at their stated or face value 
at december   we had approximately million in debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies with a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately maturing through march and callable annually 
the fair market value based on quoted market prices of this held to maturity portfolio at december   was approximately million 
at december   a portion of our assets was comprised of auction rate debt securities issued by state sponsored agencies 
while these securities have long term maturities  their interest rates are reset approximately every days through an auction process 
as a result  the interest income from these securities is subject to market risk since the rate is adjusted to accommodate market conditions on each reset date 
however  since the interest rates are reflective of current market conditions  the fair value of these securities typically does not fluctuate from par or cost 
at december   we had approximately million in these debt securities with a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately 
the fair market value based on quoted market prices of these available for sale debt securities as of december  was approximately million 
in june  we entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
under these agreements  we pay rents to wachovia generally based on applying the day libor rate plus approximately basis points to the amount funded by wachovia towards the construction of the laboratory 
the total amount of construction is estimated to be approximately million 
these rents  therefore  are subject to the risk that the libor rate will increase or decrease during the period until termination in may at december   the day libor rate was approximately 
for every movement of basis points in the day libor rate  the rents under this lease could increase or decrease by approximately  on an annualized basis
