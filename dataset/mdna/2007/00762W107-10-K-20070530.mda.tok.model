item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we provide best practices research  decision support tools and analysis across the health care industry 
best practices research identifies  analyzes and describes specific management initiatives  processes and strategies that have been determined to produce the best results in solving common business problems or challenges 
members of each program typically are charged a fixed annual fee and have access to an integrated set of services that may include best practices research studies  executive education seminars  customized research briefs  decision support tools and web based access to the program s content database 
our membership business model allows us to focus on a broad set of issues relevant to health care organizations  while promoting frequent use of our programs and services by our members 
this facilitates growth through cross sell opportunities to existing members and the development of new programs 
our revenues grew in fiscal over fiscal  and grew in fiscal over fiscal we also increased our contract value by at march  over march   and by at march  over march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all membership agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
our member renewal rate in each of the past five years has equaled or exceeded 
memberships in of our programs are renewable at the end of their membership contract term  which is typically one year 
our other eight best practices programs provide installation support 
these program memberships help participants accelerate the adoption of best practices profiled in our research studies  and are therefore not individually renewable 
as of march   more than of our contract value was generated from renewable programs 
costs associated with a new program initially increase more rapidly than revenues following introduction of the program because revenues associated with the new program are recognized ratably over the membership year while costs are generally expensed as incurred 
because we offer a standardized set of services  however  our program cost structure is relatively fixed and the incremental cost to serve an additional member is low 
our operating costs and expenses consist of cost of services  member relations and marketing  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation expenses 
cost of services represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services 
member relations and marketing expenses include the costs of acquiring new members and renewing existing members 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of human resources and recruiting  finance and accounting  management information systems  facilities management  new program development and other administrative functions 
included in our operating costs for each year presented are equity related expenses representing additional payroll taxes for compensation expense as a result of the taxable income employees recognized upon the exercise of common stock options 
share based compensation expense related to our adoption of fas r is included in our operating costs for fiscal depreciation expense includes the cost of depreciation of our property and equipment

total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the introduction and expansion of new programs and cross selling existing programs to existing members 
to a lesser degree  our revenue growth was also driven by sales to new member organizations and price increases 
we offered membership programs as of march   as of march  and as of march  our contract value increased from million at march  to million at march   and increased to million at march  our average contract value per member increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal  and increased to  for fiscal we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all membership agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
cost of services 
cost of services increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal the total dollar increase in cost of services was primarily due to the introduction of new programs as well as to increased staffing and other costs associated with the delivery of program content and tools to our expanded membership base 
in addition  beginning april   we adopted fas r  which addresses the accounting for share based compensation and  as such  approximately million of our cost of services for fiscal was from share based compensation expense not recognized within the financial statements for periods prior to april  as a percentage of revenue  cost of services was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal the increases in cost of services as a percentage of revenue were due to an increased investment in web based tools and applications which require more upfront resources before launch  the strong performance of two of our programs in which we pay a variable licensing fee to a third party  and a change in cost seasonality compared to prior years that resulted from the earlier staffing of new programs in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  following the adoption of fas r  share based compensation expense included in cost of services totaled of revenue in fiscal  compared to prior periods where share based compensation expense was not recognized within the financial statements 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from year to year  therefore the cost of services as a percentage of revenues in the periods presented may not be indicative of future results 
member relations and marketing 
member relations and marketing expense increased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the total dollar increase in member relations and marketing expense was primarily due to an increase in sales staff and related costs associated with the introduction of new programs  as well as an increase in member relations personnel and related costs to serve the expanding membership base 
in addition  beginning april   we adopted fas r  which addresses the accounting for share based compensation 
as such  approximately million  or of revenue  of our member relations and marketing expense for fiscal was due to share based compensation expense not recognized within the financial statements for periods prior to april  general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal reflects the reduction in compensation taxes paid upon the exercise of employee stock options from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as well as the leveraging of resources across our larger revenue base 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  in fiscal beginning april   we adopted fas r  which addresses the accounting for share based compensation

also in fiscal  we incurred additional amortization expense of capitalized software costs for internal use developed for some our newer membership programs that include web based tools 
interest income 
interest income increased from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the growth was principally from a higher rate of return on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities

in february  we received notification from the office of tax and revenue of the district of columbia that we had been certified  effective january   as a qualified high technology company under the new e conomy transformation act of  as amended 
this certification had the effect of reducing our washington  dc statutory income tax rate to through calendar year  and thereafter  compared to per year without the qualification 
as a result  we recorded a one time noncash charge to write down our washington  dc net operating loss carry forward deferred tax asset 
excluding the one time noncash charge our income tax rate for fiscal was

as a result  approximately million of tax benefits associated with the exercise of employee stock options were recorded as cash from financing activities in fiscal  whereas prior period results have not been restated

the credit facility renews automatically each year until  and can be increased at the request of the company by up to an additional million per year up to million in the aggregate

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
these obligations relate primarily to our headquarters office lease and are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands total yrs non cancelable operating leases off balance sheet arrangements at march   we have no off balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating off balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes

we also incurred additional compensation deductions for tax reporting purposes  but not for financial reporting purposes  that increased the deferred tax asset to reflect allowable tax deductions 
these tax deductions will be realized in the determination of our income tax liability and therefore reduce our future income tax payments 
in connection with these transactions  our deferred tax asset increased by approximately million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
although the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes did not change  our actual cash payments will be reduced as the deferred tax asset is utilized 
summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our members and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition revenues from renewable research memberships and best practices installation support memberships are recognized over the term of the related subscription agreement  which is generally months 
fees are generally billable when a letter of agreement is signed by the member  and program agreement fees receivable and related deferred revenue are recorded upon the commencement of the agreement or collection of fees if earlier 
certain fees are billed on an installment basis 
members whose membership agreements are subject to the service guarantee may request a refund of their fees  which is provided on a pro rata basis relative to the length of the service period 
for new programs that incorporate more robust decision support tools  all program revenue is deferred until the tool is generally available for release to our membership  and then recognized ratably over the remainder of the contract term of each agreement 
in addition  one of our programs includes software tools together with implementation services  technical support and related membership services 
revenue for these arrangements is recorded pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenue under these arrangements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the software and performance of the services has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we separate the fair value of the technical support and related membership services from the total value of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the fees related to the software license and implementation services are bundled and recognized as the implementation services are performed 
fees associated with the technical support and related membership services are recorded as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement  beginning when all other elements have been delivered 
allowance for uncollectible revenue we record an allowance for uncollectible revenue as a reduction of revenue based on our ongoing assessment of our members credit and the aging of receivables 
as part of our assessment  we examine our collections history  the age of accounts receivable in question  any specific customer collection issues that we have identified  general market conditions and current economic trends 
goodwill and other intangible assets our acquisition of optilink in fiscal resulted in goodwill recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill amounts are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment at least annually 
other intangible assets consist of the costs of developing software for external use  and certain intangibles acquired from our purchase of optilink 
software development costs are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives using the straight line method 
recovery of long lived assets long lived assets and identifiable assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed 
impairment is identified by comparing the carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual dispositions 
impairment is measured and recorded on the basis of fair value 
fair value is generally determined using estimates of discounted cash flows 
expected cash flows and estimated future operating results  trends  and other available information are considered in assessing whether the carrying value of assets is impaired 
we believe that no such impairment existed as of march  and deferred incentives and other charges direct incentive compensation related to the negotiation of new and renewal memberships and other direct and incremental costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the related memberships 
deferred tax asset recoverability we have deferred income taxes consisting primarily of net operating loss carry forwards for regular federal and state income tax purposes generated from the exercise of common stock options 
in estimating future tax consequences  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
generally considers all expected future events in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we believe that our future taxable income will be sufficient for the full realization of the deferred income taxes 
however  sfas no 
does not consider the effect of future changes in existing tax laws or rates in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities until the new tax laws or rates are enacted 
we have established our deferred income tax assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax laws and rates  including the estimated effects of the qhtc status on our washington  dc deferred tax assets 
we will recognize an adjustment to income for the impact of new tax laws or rates on the existing deferred tax assets and liabilities when and if new tax laws or rates are enacted 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the share based awards based on their fair values  and is recognized on a straight line basis as expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting periods of the awards  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized by us beginning april  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or after april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but that were unvested as of april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas results for prior periods have not been restated 
we previously recorded share based compensation expense in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  which allowed us to record share based compensation expense based on the intrinsic value of the share based award at the date of grant 
under fas r  the company calculates the grant date fair value of share based awards using a black scholes valuation model 
determining the fair value of share based awards is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including the term of the share based awards  risk free interest rates over the vesting period  expected dividend rates  the price volatility of the company s shares and forfeiture rates of the awards 
prior to adopting fas r  the company recognized forfeitures only as they occurred 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain 
as mandated by fas r  beginning on april   we also report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense as a financing cash inflow in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
prior to the adoption of fas r  we reported these tax benefits as an operating cash flow 
results for prior periods have not been restated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which is designed for safety of principal and liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid us treasury obligations with maturities of less than three months 
at march   our marketable securities consist of million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by the district of columbia  million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by various states  and million in us government agency securities 
the average maturity on all our marketable securities as of march  was approximately years 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit ratings related to the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this portfolio is subject to inherent interest rate risk as investments mature and are reinvested at current market interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our portfolio risk or income profile 
due to the nature of our investments we have not prepared quantitative disclosure for interest rate sensitivity in accordance with item of regulation s k as we believe the effect of interest rate fluctuations would not be material
