item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  commonly referred to as md a  is intended to help the reader understand zoltek  our operations and our business environment 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
this overview summarizes the md a  which includes the following sections our business a general description of the key drivers that affect our business  the industry in which we operate and the strategic initiatives on which we focus 
results of operations an analysis of our overall results of operations and segment results for the three years presented in our financial statements 
we operate in two segments carbon fiber and technical fiber 
other miscellaneous and corporate are combined into a third business segment called headquarters other 
liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  sources and uses of cash  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  the potential impact of currency exchange and an overview of our financial position 
critical accounting estimates a description of accounting estimates that require critical judgments and estimates 
our business we are an applied technology and advanced materials company 
we are a leader in the commercialization of carbon fibers through our development of a price competitive  high performance reinforcement for composites used in a broad range of commercial products 
in addition to manufacturing carbon fibers  we produce an intermediate product that we refer to as technical fiber  a stabilized and oxidized acrylic fiber used in flame and heat resistant applications 
we have spent over years developing our proprietary technology and manufacturing processes 
we believe that we are the largest manufacturer primarily focused on producing low cost carbon fibers for commercial applications 
the company s primary business segments are based on product lines and include carbon fibers and technical fibers 
the carbon fibers segment manufactures low cost carbon fibers used as reinforcement material in composites  carbon fiber composite products and filament winding equipment used in the composite industry 
the technical fibers segment manufactures oxidized acrylic fibers used to manufacture aircraft brake pads for heat fire barrier applications 
these two segments also facilitate development of product and process applications to increase the demand for carbon fibers and technical fibers and seek to aggressively market carbon fibers and technical fibers 
the carbon fiber and technical fiber segments are located geographically in the united states and hungary 
we operate manufacturing plants in hungary  texas and missouri 
our plant in hungary is our major carbon fiber manufacturing facility 
our hungarian plant also manufactures acrylic fiber precursor  the raw material that we use to make carbon fibers and intermediate oxidized acrylic fibers 
our texas plant produces carbon fiber and has value added processing capabilities 
our missouri facility is primarily dedicated to the production of technical fibers for aircraft brake and other friction applications and it also produces limited quantities of carbon fibers 
since fiscal  there has been a structural shift in the carbon fiber market 
strong demand from the higher cost aerospace applications has caused a shortage in supply for the commercial applications that we supply 
during this period  we have experienced rapid growth due to sharply increased demand for commercial carbon fibers  primarily from producers of large composite blades used in wind turbines 
we believe that  over the past two years  there has been increased interest in and usage of carbon fibers in the oil exploration  automotive and construction end markets 
our revenue has increased from million in fiscal to million for fiscal to support this growth  we expanded our manufacturing capacity from two continuous carbonization lines in operation at the beginning of fiscal to our current lines 
the following factors have affected the net sales of our carbon fiber segment in recent years the growth in emerging applications using carbon fiber such as wind turbines  increases in our manufacturing capacity  and the significant price increases that we have successfully implemented 
we would expect that our net sales in future periods will continue to be affected by the first and second of these factors 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to implement in the future price increases similar to those we implemented in the recent past 
the net sales of our technical fiber segment have been affected in the past  and we expect will continue to be affected in the foreseeable future  by available manufacturing capacity and the demand resulting from aircraft brake manufacturers and heat and flame resistant applications 

table of contents the primary cost components of our carbon fiber and technical fiber segments are acrylonitrile  which is a propylene based by product and our primary raw material for the production of acrylic fiber precursor used in our carbon fiber and technical fiber production  energy  and labor 
acrylic fiber precursor comprises approximately of the total cost of producing carbon fibers 
in addition  since fiscal  we have incurred substantial litigation costs  which we expect will not continue at prior levels 
we expect that new applications  including those we are attempting to facilitate  will continue to positively affect demand for our products 
any reduction in the use of carbon fiber in aerospace applications could increase the supply of carbon fibers and the competition we face for commercial applications 
for the fiscal  four customers accounted for approximately of our revenue and our largest customer represented approximately of our revenue 
we expect this customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
we have recently entered into long term supply contracts with several of our key customers 
in may we entered into a new contract with vestas wind systems under which we estimate  based on current prices and minimum purchase commitments  that we will supply approximately million of carbon fibers in increasing volumes over the contract s five year term 
in august  we entered into a new contract with gamesa group  under which we estimate  based on current prices and minimum purchase commitments  that we will supply approximately million of carbon fibers over the contract s five year term 
in june  we entered into a contract with dewind incorporated under which we estimate  based on current prices  that we will supply approximately million of carbon fibers over the contract s three year term 
we believe that our existing capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current long term supply agreements 
to meet increasing demand from current commercial application customers and provide carbon fibers for emerging applications  we have developed and are executing plans to further expand our capacity building additional capacity at our existing facilities and by acquiring a new facility 
we are installing additional production design capacity in hungary that we expect to be operating during the second quarter of fiscal in addition  in october  we announced that we have purchased the guadalajara  mexico based crysel acrylic fiber manufacturing assets of cydsa  a large publicly traded mexican chemical and industrial company 
we estimate the total investment will be approximately million to purchase the facility  to retool and modify the plant  to produce acrylic precursor and to install the initial four carbon fiber lines 
we expect that precursor production will begin by the end of fiscal we plan to install four continuous carbonization lines during the first quarter of fiscal at the mexico facility 
we believe the acquisition of the mexico plant gives us the opportunity to increase our manufacturing capacity of precursor and increase our carbon fiber lines at favorable costs

 earnings per share  the company has evaluated its diluted income per share calculation 
the company does have outstanding warrants and convertible debt at september  and which are not included in the determination of diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended september  and because the shares are anti dilutive 
had these securities been dilutive  an additional million and million shares would have been included in the company s diluted loss per share calculation 
legal contingencies legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty 
when losses from contingencies become estimatable and probable  reserves are established 
the reserves reflect management s estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matters and are revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when matters are brought to closure 
if any litigation matter is resolved unfavorably  the company could incur obligations in excess of management s estimate of the outcome  and such resolution could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
as of september   the company has established an accrual for legal liabilities of million 
in february  sp systems and its subsidiary structural polymer systems  limited filed an action against our zoltek corporation subsidiary in the us district court for the eastern district of missouri  eastern division alleging that we breached a supply agreement relating to our carbon fiber product known as panex the case was tried in november and on november   the jury in the case rendered verdicts against our zoltek corporation subsidiary in the amounts of million and million  respectively  which verdicts were subsequently entered as judgments against our zoltek corporation subsidiary 
on april   the court ruled on various post trial motions  granting one of our motions to reduce the judgment from million to million  concluding that the jury s award of damages on the two separate counts brought by the plaintiffs was duplicative 
the court issued an order setting the amount of a supersedeas bond at million in order to stay the execution of the amended judgment pending our appeal and denied our post trial motions for a new trial and for a judgment in our favor as a matter of law 
the bond was posted in april we accrued million during the fourth quarter of fiscal in respect of the potential liability and related legal fees in this matter 
we have filed an appeal and the plaintiffs have filed a cross appeal 
on the basis of the plaintiffs settlement proposals and the reduction of the judgment in april  the company reduced the accrual to million  which decreased litigation charges by million for the quarter ended june  as of september   the company s accrual with respect to this matter has been reduced to million due to litigation cost incurred during the fourth quarter 
in november  sp systems purported to terminate the supply agreement 
the ultimate resolution of this litigation may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
in september  the company was named a defendant in a civil action filed by an investment banker that was retained to obtain equity investors  alleging breach by the company of the company s obligations under the agreement signed by the parties 
a decision granting summary judgment against zoltek was entered in april a trial on damages took place in december  after which a judgment was filed in may against the company in the amount of million in cash and the court ordered us to issue warrants to purchase  shares of zoltek s common stock at various prices 
in october  the united states court of appeals for the second circuit upheld the liability against zoltek affirming million in cash and approximately  warrants 
the court reversed the district court s award of attorney s fees stemming from indemnification of the plaintiff by zoltek and remanded the determination of damages in respect to placements of securities not closed within the month tail period back to the district court for reconsideration 
the appeal process continues and attempts to settle this case have been made 
to date  the company has not made payments of any portion of this obligation or issued the warrants  although zoltek posted an appeal bond in the amount of million 
on the basis of the appeals court ruling and the ongoing settlement 
table of contents discussions the company charged million to litigation charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal to increase the accrual to million 
this accrual is based on management s best estimate of exposure for this matter  including a likely cash settlement of million and a potential issuance of  warrants valued using the stock price on the date of the appeals court ruling net of the warrants exercise price 
the company expects to adjust the recorded liability for this potential warrant issuance as the company s stock price increases or decreases 
these charges or income could be material 
if negotiations for settlement of this case are unsuccessful  this matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
in october  the company was named as a defendant in a civil action filed in the court of common pleas for cuyahoga county  ohio by the former owner of hardcore composites operations  llc hardcore alleging breach by hardcore and the company of their respective obligations under a sublease  the company s guaranty of the sublease  and prior settlement agreement among the parties 
zoltek and the former owners of hardcore and their successors entered into a settlement agreement and release whereby zoltek paid million cash  which increased litigation charges by million for the quarter ended june   and was completely released of all claims with prejudice 
the company is a party to various other claims and legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of its business 
although there can be no assurance  in the opinion of management  the ultimate outcome of these other claims and lawsuits should not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
critical accounting estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
all of the company s accounting policies are in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates  assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements  and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows accounts receivable collectibility the company evaluates the collectibility of our accounts receivable for each of our segments based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filing or substantial downgrading of credit  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against the amounts due reducing the net recognized receivable to the amount we estimate will be collected 
for all other customers  we estimate reserves for bad debts based on the length of time receivables have been past due and our experience with collection 
our bad debt expense on accounts receivables was million for  million for and million for inventories the company evaluates its ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons 
inventories in excess of future demand  if any  are reserved 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
cost includes material  labor and overhead 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company s projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales excluding available unused capacity costs on the company s statement of operations in the period in which the revision is made 
for several years prior to fiscal  carbon fiber sales were depressed by excess capacity across the industry  distressed pricing across most existing markets and weakening economic conditions globally 
these factors combined with the high level of inventories maintained by the company  resulted in the company reducing the cost of certain carbon fiber inventories to their lower estimated market values 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
in determining expected future undiscounted cash flows attributable to a long lived asset or a group of long lived assets  the company must make certain judgments and estimations including the expected market conditions and demand for products produced by the assets  expected product pricing assumptions  and assumptions related to the expected costs to operate the assets 
it is possible that actual future cash flows related to the company s long lived assets may materially differ from the company s determination of expected future undiscounted cash flows 
additionally  if the company s expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset being analyzed  it would be necessary for the company to make significant judgments regarding the fair value of the asset due to the specialized nature of much of the company s carbon fiber production equipment in order to determine the amount of the impairment charge 

table of contents contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to employment  environmental  service providers  supply agreements  taxing authorities and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required  if any  for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events  and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances  differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages  and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
income taxes the company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against certain deferred tax assets when realization of those assets are not considered to be more likely than not 
we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous tax authorities 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are generally taxed on income before taxes adjusted for various differences between tax law and gaap accounting 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
stock based compensation on october   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
under the modified prospective method of adopting sfas no 
r  the company recognized compensation cost for all share based payments granted after october   plus any awards granted to employees prior to october  that remain unvested at that time 
under this method of adoption  no restatement of prior periods is made 
the company uses historical volatility for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option 
however  the company only calculates the volatility of the company s stock back to november  the date the company received its first large order for carbon fibers  as that is when the company considers its business to have changed from a research and development company to an operational company 
management believes this is a better measurement of the company s stock volatility

subsidiary of million 
the company does not expect the loan to be repaid in the near future

in addition  since the effective registration of the securities underlying the conversion feature and warrants is an event outside of the control of the company  pursuant to eitf issue no 
 the company recorded the fair value of the conversion feature and warrants as long term liabilities as it was assumed that the company would be required to net cash settle the underlying securities

since these gains and loss are non cash in nature the company does not expect to employ a type of hedging strategy related to these transactions
