table of contents inc for million in cash and began providing programming  sales and other related services for kasa tv under a local marketing agreement on september  the acquisition was completed on february  we have consolidated its operating results and financial position under the consolidation principles of fin r in our consolidated financial statements since the third quarter of we have combined the studios and operations of kasa tv with our other albuquerque station  krqe tv 
chief executive officer 
on july   we announced the appointment of vincent l 
sadusky as president and chief executive officer of our company 
wbpg tv acquisition 
on july   we completed our acquisition of the assets of wbpg tv  including the broadcast license  for million 
from november  through closing we provided programming  sales and other related services pursuant to a local marketing agreement 
description of our business strategy we seek to increase our revenues and cash flow through a number of key strategic and operating goals  including i growing the audiences for our television stations and internet websites and seeking new audience segments by using other forms of digital distribution  ii increasing our advertising  digital and other revenues  and iii continuing our implementation of cost efficiencies and use of new technology to streamline operations 
the principal components of our strategy are to maintain our local news franchises 
we operate the number one or number two local news station in of our markets and generated of our advertising revenues from our local news programming for the year ended december  we have been recognized for our local news expertise and have won many awards  including the radio television new directors association  edward r 
murrow award for excellence in journalism and numerous local and regional awards such as associated press awards and emmys 
we believe that successful local news programming is among the most important elements in attracting local advertising revenue 
in addition  news audiences serve as vital lead ins for other programming and help create a leading local station brand in the communities in which we operate  minimizing the impact of changes in the popularity of network programming on any particular station 
continue to pursue our multi channel strategy 
as a pioneer in the multi channel strategy  we have expanded our presence in our local markets beyond that of a single channel by i acquiring a second station  ii programming  providing advertising sales and other related services for another station through a local marketing agreement  iii acquiring a low power television station  iv creating local cable weather channels  or v entering into joint sales agreements 
this added channel and distribution capacity allows us to appeal to a wider audience and market of advertisers while also providing us with economies of scale to pursue additional and new programming services 
as a result  we believe our duopoly stations provide us with a substantial competitive advantage in a number of markets where we have these additional stations and channels 
maintain our strong and diversified network relationships and programming 
we have stations affiliated with eight networks cbs  nbc  abc  fox  cw  mynetworktv  telefutura and univision 
many of these network affiliation relationships are long standing over years in length and provide our stations with high quality entertainment  strong national news and high profile sports event programming  many in high definition hd signal form  that further differentiate our stations as leaders in the local markets we serve 
we also believe that our affiliation diversification among all of the networks optimally balances our station portfolio  which results in our company not being exposed to short term programming or ratings changes that could otherwise impact our consolidated net revenues and cash flow 

table of contents sustain and grow our revenue share 
we have generally achieved revenue share greater than our audience share 
given our strong local station brands  market leading news and sales expertise in most of the markets we serve  our goal is to convert this audience share into an even greater share of advertising revenues 
as a result  we have typically been among the top stations in local and national advertising billing and market share in many of our markets 
reach new agreements for retransmission consent 
in  congress granted local television stations the right for the first time to control retransmission of their signals on cable and satellite systems 
the fcc adopted rules permitting stations the triennial option of choosing either mandatory carriage and desirable channel placement without compensation  known as must carry or negotiating retransmission consent in which they could seek remuneration  but potentially bear the risk of getting reduced carriage at no  or even reverse  compensation 
despite the strength of their local news programming and audience ratings as compared with the lower rated national cable channels  which receive sizeable license fees from cable and satellite operators  local stations were unable to obtain meaningful cash compensation for their signals 
this was due to a variety of factors  but primarily related to stations poor negotiating leverage resulting from ownership consolidation and the lack of local competition in the cable industry 
in  congress authorized satellite video carriers to distribute the signals of local stations in those stations local markets  so called local into local service 
the satellite carriers  directv and echostar  initiated local into local over the next several years and now provide that service in all but a few very small television markets 
they have proven to be formidable competitors to incumbent cable systems  garnering approximately percent of pay television households by from the onset of local into local service the satellite carriers have paid cash compensation to local broadcast stations for carriage of their signals 
in  the largest telecommunications operators  att and verizon  also initiated entry into the video services market in a number local markets and declared their intention to provide cable service throughout their service areas  which cover nearly all of the lin television markets 
finally  most local broadcast stations have constructed digital transmission facilities and are broadcasting most of their prime time and other major events in hd 
we believe that the heightened local competition in the delivery of multichannel video and the economic interest of pay television companies in carrying both the analog and the hd signals of broadcast television stations  combined with our strong local news rankings  duopoly station ownership positions and network affiliations  provide us with compelling negotiating positions as we pursue new retransmission consent agreements with these pay television companies for the carriage of our signals 
grow our internet business 
broadband penetration in most of our markets has continued to grow substantially  making the internet available to a large portion of our audience 
our strong local television station brands and considerable news  sports  weather  traffic and other local video content  which is among the type of content most desired by internet viewers  have provided us with the opportunity to efficiently line extend and leverage our station brands online 
we currently operate websites for our local television stations and achieve approximately million unique visitors and million page views a month in the aggregate 
we heavily cross promote our sites using our own television station advertising inventory 
we believe the internet provides our stations with the opportunity to reach our existing and new audiences at home  out of home and at work and with content that we would otherwise not be able to deliver to them via broadcast distribution 
the internet also allows us to sell additional and new forms of advertising to existing and new customers 
we plan to further grow the internet portion of our business over the next several years by becoming one of the top destination websites in each of our local markets  adding more internet dedicated employees and launching new websites 
launch new digital services 
analog television receivers cannot receive digital transmissions nor can they display hd pictures 
to enable local broadcasters to convert from analog to digital transmissions  the fcc granted virtually all broadcast television stations a second channel to initiate digital transmissions 
the fcc conditioned that grant  however  on the requirement that 
table of contents the analog transmissions eventually be discontinued and the analog channels returned to the government for reallocation 
on february   a congressional mandate was signed into law setting the date for discontinuation of analog broadcasting of february  all but one of our stations have completed construction of their digital broadcast facilities and we anticipate that all will be constructed prior to the deadline 
in addition to hd capability  digital transmissions can carry multiple program services and will eventually be able to transmit to mobile devices 
we believe there are a number of potentially attractive new video and data program services we can pursue that utilize the full capacity of our digital signals 
we also believe that because in our larger markets we have two digital channels  this gives us a particularly strong platform with which to launch these services 
we expect to fund several research and development efforts in this area over the coming years to determine which new business applications are most advantageous for our company 
further expand our regional television technology centers 
we operate two regional television technology centers that have centralized engineering  operations and administration for multiple stations at a single location 
in indianapolis and springfield  we service eleven stations and six stations  respectively 
we plan to further increase the productivity of these regional centers over time and believe we can accommodate more stations and functions in both regional centers 
continue to improve our cost efficiencies 
we have achieved companywide operating efficiencies by applying scale in the purchase of programming  ratings services and other research  national sales representation  capital equipment and other vendor services 
we intend to continue this practice and seek new areas and ways to achieve improved cost efficiencies  which recently included our decision to centralize a number of additional back office functions  including station accounting  at our two shared services and accounting locations in providence and indianapolis 
principal sources of revenue time sales television advertising net time sales represented approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our company receives revenues principally from advertising sold in our local news  network and syndicated programming 
advertising rates are based upon a variety of factors  including size and demographic makeup of the market served by the television station  a program s popularity among television viewers  number of advertisers competing for the available time  availability of alternative advertising media in the station s market area  our station s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area  our station s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting  and effectiveness of our sales force 
local television markets are defined by nielsen  an audience measurement service used by the television industry 
nielsen currently divides the united states into approximately dmas and samples television audience viewing using electronic viewing devices or meters and viewing diaries 
nielsen publishes an audience viewing report for each dma for the months of february  may  july and november that includes the estimated television audiences for each local station and cable television network 
in addition  larger television markets  where the audience is measured by electronic meters  receive daily audience data feeds from nielsen 

table of contents network compensation the three oldest networks  abc  cbs and nbc  had historically made cash compensation payments for our carriage of their network programming 
however  our recent agreements with these networks now reflect a reduction and eventual elimination of network compensation payments to us and  in certain contract extensions  require us to pay compensation to the network 
in particular  the newer networks  such as fox  cw  upn and mynetworktv  provide less network programming  pay no network compensation and  in some instances  require us to pay network compensation 
however  these newer networks provide us with more advertising inventory to sell than traditional networks 
barter revenues we occasionally barter our unsold advertising inventory for goods and services that are required to operate our television stations and acquire certain syndicated programming by providing a portion of the available advertising inventory within the program  in lieu of cash payments 
digital revenues we generate digital revenues from advertising produced by our television stations internet websites and from retransmission consent fees received from cable  direct broadcast satellite dbs and telecommunications companies for the rights to carry our analog and hd television station signals in their pay television services to consumers 
other revenues we receive other revenues from sources such as renting space on our television towers  renting our production facilities and providing television production services 
sources and availability of programming we program our television stations from the following program sources locally produced news and general entertainment programming that is produced by our local television stations  network programming  syndicated programming off network programs  such as the simpsons or everybody loves raymond  and first run programs  such as oprah  judge judy or wheel of fortune  paid programming arrangements where a third party pays our stations for a block of time  generally in one half hour or one hour time periods to air long form advertising or infomercials  and local weather station we provide a hour weather channel to local cable systems in certain of our television markets 
locally produced news and general entertainment programming our stations produce an aggregate of hours of local news programming per week that we broadcast on all but three of our stations 
we believe that successful local news programming is an important element in attracting local advertising revenues 
in addition  our news programs have had historically high ratings and strong viewership  have served as strong lead ins for other programs and 
table of contents have created strong local station brands in each of our local communities 
local news programming also allows us greater control over our programming costs 
our current network affiliations and number of weekly hours of network  local news and other local programming are as follows weekly hours dma network local news other local contract network dma rank station programming programming programming end date nbc grand rapids kalamazoo battle creek  mi wood tv austin  tx kxan tv dayton  oh wdtn tv springfield holyoke  ma wwlp tv norfolk portsmouth newport news  va wavy tv cbs indianapolis  in wish tv albuquerque  nm krqe tv buffalo  ny wivb tv providence  ri new bedford  ma wpri tv fort wayne  in wane tv terre haute  in wthi tv lafayette  in wlfi tv abc hartford new haven  ct wtnh tv grand rapids kalamazoo battle creek  mi wotv tv fox norfolk portsmouth newport news  va wvbt tv providence  ri new bedford  ma wnac tv mobile pensacola  fl wala tv albuquerque  nm kasa tv toledo  ohio wupw tv green bay  wi wluk tv cw columbus  oh wwho tv mobile pensacola  fl wbpg tv austin  tx knva tv buffalo  ny wnlo tv mynetworktv grand rapids kalamazoo battle creek  mi wxsp ca indianapolis  in wndy tv hartford new haven  ct wctx tv telefutura austin  tx kbvo ca univision indianapolis  in wiih lp an affiliation agreement is currently being negotiated  we believe that we will be able to conclude an agreement with this network 
wotv tv and wxsp ca simulcast hours and hours  respectively  of locally produced news from wood tv each week 
krqe tv has two satellite stations  krez tv and kbim tv 
network programming all of our stations are affiliated with one of the national television networks 
the network affiliation agreements provide a local station exclusive rights and an obligation  subject to certain limited preemption rights  to carry the network programming 
while the networks retain most of the advertising time within their programs for their own use  the local station also has the right to sell a limited amount of advertising time within the network programs 
other time periods  which are not programmed by the networks  are programmed by the local station  for which the local station retains all of the advertising revenues 

table of contents the programming strength of a particular national television network may affect a local station s competitive position 
our stations  however  are diversified among the major and emerging networks  reducing the potential impact of any one network s performance 
we believe that national television network affiliations remain an efficient means of obtaining competitive programming  both for established stations with strong local news franchises and for newer stations with greater programming needs 
our stations generated an average of of their total net revenue from the sale of advertising within network programming for the year ended december  our stations that are affiliated with traditional broadcast networks generate a higher percentage of revenue from the sale of advertising within network programming than stations affiliated with the newer networks 
our affiliation agreements have terms with scheduled expiration dates ranging through september  the chart on page lists the expiration dates of each of our network affiliation agreements 
typically  these agreements either contain automatic extensions or are renewed by the network upon their expiration dates 
these agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances  including a change of control of our company  which would generally result from the acquisition of of the voting rights of our company 
for further information about our network affiliation arrangements  see risk factors risks associated with business activities the loss of network affiliation agreements or changes in network affiliations could materially and adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to quickly replace the network affiliation 
syndicated programming our company acquires the rights to programs for time periods in which we do not air our local news or network programs 
these programs generally include reruns of current or former network programs  such as the simpsons or everybody loves raymond  or first run syndicated programs  such as oprah  judge judy or wheel of fortune 
we pay cash for these programs or exchange advertising time within the program for the cost of the program rights 
we compete with other local television stations to acquire these programs  which has caused the cost of program rights to increase over time 
in addition  a television viewer can now choose to watch many of these programs on national cable networks or purchase these programs on dvds or via downloads to computers or mobile video devices  which has contributed to increasing fragmentation of our local television audience 
distribution of programming the programming that airs on our television stations can reach the television audience by one or more of the following distribution systems full power television stations low power television stations cable television dbs internet telecommunication systems full power television stations we own and operate vhf full power television stations that operate on over the air channels through  and uhf full power television stations that operate on over the air channels through for the year ended december   our full power television stations generated of our 
table of contents net revenue  including three stations for which we provided programming  sales and other related services under local marketing agreements that contributed of our net revenue during the fcc television licenses for the two stations for which we provide programming  sales and other related services under a local marketing agreement are not owned by us 
the local marketing agreements require us to pay fixed annual fees to the owners of the fcc television licenses 
we incur programming costs  operating costs and the capital expenditures related to the operation of these stations  and retain all advertising revenues 
in the two local markets where these stations are currently located  we own and operate another station 
these local marketing agreement stations are an important part of our multi channel strategy 
we also have purchase options to acquire these stations and both the local marketing and purchase option agreements have terms extending from one to two years 
see government regulation of the television industry for a discussion of regulatory issues facing the commercial television broadcasting industry 
see our television stations above for a listing of our full power television stations 
low power television stations we own and operate a number of low power television stations in five of our markets 
we operate these stations either as stand alone stations or as satellite stations 
these low power broadcast television stations are licensed by the fcc to provide service to substantially smaller areas than those of full power stations 
in three of our markets  albuquerque  austin and norfolk portsmouth newport news  we use our low power stations to extend the geographic reach of our primary stations in these markets 
in three of our markets  we have affiliated our low power stations with a national television network in indianapolis  we operate wiih tv  a single low power station affiliated with univision  which also utilizes cable carriage to cover that portion of the market it cannot reach over the air 
in grand rapids  we operate wxsp tv  a group of low power television stations affiliated with mynetworktv  to cover substantially all of the local market 
in austin  in addition to operating one of our low power stations to extend the signal of kxan tv  we operate kbvo tv  a group of low power television stations affiliated with telefutura  to cover substantially all of the local market 
cable television  dbs and telecommunications systems according to nielsen  cable systems and dbs providers currently provide program services to approximately of total us television households  with cable systems serving and dbs serving 
as a result  cable  dbs and telecommunication systems are not only our primary competitors  but the primary way our television audience views our television stations 
our company has carriage arrangements with over  cable systems  the two major dbs providers and two telecommunications systems 
these arrangements are of two different types must carry and retransmission consent 
under must carry arrangements  the stations invoke an fcc rule requiring carriage by the cable system or satellite provider of local stations in their local markets and requiring local stations be carried on certain channels and on tiers of service available to all subscribers 
cable systems and satellite providers do not pay a fee for station carriage under must carry arrangements 
under retransmission consent arrangements  stations waive their must carry rights and elect to be carried by the cable system or satellite provider under negotiated contractual terms 
these terms may include not just agreements with respect to channel positioning and service tier carriage but other compensation  such as cash payments for our stations or carriage for another program service  advertising payments or joint promotional commitments 
the cash compensation received from these agreements is not currently material to our operating results 

table of contents we are required to make must carry retransmission consent elections every three years  with the next election to be made by october   to become effective january  however  most of our stations are currently operating under month to month extensions of retransmission consent agreements with cable companies for carriage of our analog signals only  these cable companies do not have the rights to carry our hd signals 
seasonality of our business our advertising revenues are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  due generally to higher advertising in the spring season and due to increases in retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the end of year holiday season 
our operating results are also significantly affected by annual cycles  as advertising revenues are generally higher in even numbered years ie    due to additional revenues associated with election years and advertising spending by political candidates and incremental advertising revenues associated with olympic broadcasts 
the broadcast television industry is also cyclical in nature  being affected by prevailing economic conditions 
since we rely on sales of advertising time for substantially all of our revenues  our operating results are sensitive to general economic and regional conditions in each local market our stations operate 
dependence on a single customer category our company is dependent to a significant degree on automotive related advertising 
approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  consisted of automotive advertising 
a significant decrease in these advertising revenues in the future could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
digital transition of our stations the fcc granted most broadcast television stations a second channel to facilitate the transition from analog to digital transmission 
on february   a measure was signed into law that set an unconditional digital conversion date of february   the transition date and included a program to subsidize the digital conversion of remaining analog receivers 
as of december   we have successfully converted all of the full power stations that we own and operate to digital with the exception of wbpg tv in mobile pensacola  which has not yet completed its digital construction 
wbpg tv has just recently been allotted a digital channel by the fcc  subject to final approval  and may not be permitted to initiate digital transmissions until shortly before or on february  further  in order to optimize their signal coverage  wnac tv  wthi tv  wluk tv and krqe tv including a satellite station of krqe tv  all of which currently operate uhf digital stations  will go through further changes to move their digital operations to their present vhf analog channel 
wane tv is awaiting the grant of a construction permit to operate at the legal maximum power currently allowed 
all six of these stations have been tentatively granted these channels  published in an fcc notice of proposed rulemaking  and barring public objection  these will be formally granted 
the costs associated with conversion of these stations to their final digital operation are estimated at million over the next two years 
we also own and operate many low power translator stations as part of these full power stations 
we will incur an additional cost of approximately million over the next two years to convert these translator stations to digital 
during the fcc allowed the broadcast industry to file applications to modify low power stations to digital 
most of our stations were able to apply to operate our existing low power stations as digital channels 
however  some of our low power stations could not operate digitally on their current channel because the channel is not included in the fcc s revised channel plan channels to that will be in effect after february   or the channel would have an interference problem after digital conversion 
for these low power stations  we were able to request what the fcc terms a companion 
table of contents channel 
with the companion channel  low power stations can operate digitally on a new channel 
in the case of our low power stations  most filed to stay on their existing channels and the remainder were granted a companion channel 
in some cases our low power stations will be able to extend their coverage beyond that presently offered by the station s existing analog channel 
the cost to convert these stations to digital operation is million over the next two years 
competitive conditions in the television industry the television broadcast industry has become highly competitive over the past ten years as a result of new technologies and new program distribution systems 
local cable systems  which offer television viewers hundreds of program choices  now compete for advertising dollars that were generally exclusive to local television stations 
in some of our local markets  we compete directly against other local broadcast stations and cable systems that are owned by one of the major media companies that have greater financial and programming resources than we do 
the chart below illustrates some of the competitive forces that we face in terms of audience  advertising revenues and programming 
competition for viewing advertising time revenues programming other local television stations x x x cable television networks x x x local cable systems x x local telecommunications systems x x dbs x internet x x game systems ie playstation  xbox x dvds x computers and mobile video devices ie ipods  etc 
x x local radio stations x newspapers x outdoor advertising x the television broadcast industry is undergoing a period of consolidation and significant technological change 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
we believe  however  that our local news programming  network affiliations and sales management have enabled us to compete effectively in our markets 
government regulation of the television industry overview of regulatory issues the ownership  operation and sale of television stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc by authority granted it under the communications act 
matters subject to fcc oversight include  but are not limited to allocating frequency bands to broadcast television  allotting specific channels frequencies to specific cities  and approving the location  operating power and types of transmission of each television station  establishing limits on the number of television stations which may be owned nationally and in each local market either separately or in conjunction with other media  establishing eligibility criteria for ownership of broadcast television station licenses and approving license renewals and transfers  
table of contents enforcing various broadcast programming content laws or regulations including those barring or restricting obscene or indecent content  mandating children s educational programming and regulating advertising directed at children  and overseeing certain broadcast health and employment regulations 
the fcc has the power to impose penalties  including fines or license revocations  upon a licensee of a television station for violations of the communications act and the fcc s rules and regulations 
license renewal  assignment and transfer of broadcast licenses television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the fcc 
the fcc prohibits the assignment of a license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior fcc approval 
in determining whether to grant or renew a broadcast license  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the applicant  including compliance with a variety of ownership limitations and compliance with character and technical standards 
during certain limited periods when a renewal application is pending  petitions to deny a license renewal may be filed by interested parties  including members of the public 
the fcc must grant the renewal application if it finds that the incumbent has served the public interest and has not committed any serious violation of fcc rules 
if the incumbent fails to meet that standard  and if it does not show other mitigating factors warranting a lesser sanction  the fcc has authority to deny the renewal application 
we are in good standing with respect to each of our fcc licenses 
our licenses have expiration dates ranging between and the table on page includes the expiration date of each of our licenses 
we have timely filed license renewal applications for each of our stations 
once an application for renewal is filed  each station remains licensed while its application is pending  even after its license expiration date has passed 
we expect to renew each of these licenses but we make no assurance that we will be able to do so 
certain of our licenses have pending applications for renewal that we expect to be reviewed and granted in regulation of ownership of broadcast licenses on a national level  fcc rules generally prevent an entity or individual from having an attributable interest in television stations that collectively have an aggregate audience reach in excess of of all us households 
for this purpose only of the television households in a market are counted towards the national restriction if the station in that market is a uhf station 
the percentage of all us households that our stations reach is approximately 
the fcc s duopoly rule generally prohibits or restricts an entity from having attributable interests in two or more television stations in the same local market 
the rule permits ownership of two television stations in a local market under certain circumstances  primarily where a party is seeking to combine two stations if at least one of the stations is not among the top four in audience and there are at least eight post merger  independently owned television operations 
waivers of the rule are also available where one of the stations has failed  is failing or is unbuilt 
local marketing agreements are considered equivalent to ownership for purposes of the local ownership rules and thus  subject to certain exceptions  are permissible only where ownership is permissible 
the fcc has grandfathered otherwise ineligible television local marketing agreements entered into prior to november   until at least after the conclusion of a rulemaking  to be initiated at a date yet to be determined  examining whether it would be in the public interest to permit such combinations to continue 
grandfathered local marketing agreements can be freely transferred during the grandfather period  but dual licenses may be transferred only where the two station combination continues to qualify under the duopoly rule 
we have acquired four of our stations that we had previously provided programming  sales and other related services for under a local marketing agreement 
three markets  grand rapids kalamazoo battle creek  norfolk portsmouth newport news and albuquerque satisfied the requirement for a sufficient number of post merger  independently owned television stations and did not require waivers of the duopoly rule for conversion to ownership or subsequent transferability 
the station in new 
table of contents haven applied for and was granted an unbuilt station duopoly waiver 
a subsequent transfer of the duopoly in new haven may require a waiver if no additional independent stations initiate operations 
eligibility for a waiver will depend upon the station s future performance 
in the event that the fcc determines that the grandfathered local marketing agreement in austin and providence is ineligible for conversion to full ownership  we have the right to assign our purchase option to a third party and we believe we can arrange a suitable disposition  including alternative non attributable operating arrangements with such a party  such as a more limited programming and services agreement or joint sales agreement  which will not be materially less favorable to us than the current local marketing agreement 
however  the rules may not be implemented or interpreted in such a manner 
the fcc also limits the combined local ownership of a newspaper and a broadcast radio or television station 
in addition  it limits the number of radio stations that may be co owned with a television station serving the same local market 
in  the fcc voted to revise and in most cases liberalize substantially several of its national and local ownership rules 
in  the united states court of appeals found virtually all of these actions to be without adequate support and remanded to the fcc for further deliberation 
in  the united states supreme court declined to hear an appeal of the court of appeals decision 
in june  the fcc adopted a further rulemaking proceeding to reexamine the ownership rules in light of the court decision 
that proceeding is ongoing 
meanwhile  in  congress by statute fixed the limit on nationwide ownership of television broadcast stations at of all us households and the fcc has conformed its rules to that statute 
the fcc generally applies its ownership limits only to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association 
in the case of corporations holding broadcast licenses  the interest of officers  directors and those who  directly or indirectly  have the right to vote or more of the corporation s voting stock  or or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies  mutual funds  bank trust departments and certain other passive investors that are holding stock for investment purposes only  are generally deemed to be attributable  as are positions as an officer or director of a corporate parent of a broadcast licensee 
debt and non voting stock are generally nonattributable interests 
moreover  pending completion of a court ordered rulemaking  the fcc has restored an exemption to attribution of voting stock in any entity  which has a single shareholder with more than of that entity s voting stock 
in any event  the holder of an otherwise nonattributable stock or debt interest in a licensee which is in excess of of the total assets of the licensee debt plus equity will nonetheless be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station  cable system or newspaper in the same market 
while intending to provide licensees and investors with clear attribution standards  the fcc has stated that it reserves the authority  in an appropriate case  to declare as being attributable an unusual combination of otherwise nonattributable interests 
because of these multiple and cross ownership rules  any person or entity that acquires an attributable interest in us may violate the fcc s rules if that purchaser also has an attributable interest in other television or radio stations  or in daily newspapers  depending on the number and location of those radio or television stations or daily newspapers 
such person or entity also may be restricted in the companies in which it may invest to the extent that those investments give rise to an attributable interest 
if the holder of an attributable interest violates any of these ownership rules or if a proposed acquisition by us would cause such a violation  we may be unable to obtain from the fcc one or more authorizations needed to conduct our television station business and may be unable to obtain the fcc s consents for certain future acquisitions 
regulatory issues involving alien ownership the communications act restricts the ability of foreign entities or individuals to own or vote certain interests in broadcast licenses 
a foreign corporation or non us citizen cannot own more than of a corporation that holds a broadcast license 
also  no corporation may hold the capital stock of 
table of contents another corporation holding a broadcast license if more than of the capital stock of such parent corporation is owned by a foreign corporation or non us citizen absent specific fcc authorization 
regulatory issues involving programming and station operations the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
since the early s  the fcc gradually has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station s local market 
broadcast station licensees continue  however  to be required to present programming that is responsive to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness 
complaints from viewers concerning a station s programming may be considered by the fcc when it evaluates license renewal applications  although such complaints may be filed  and generally may be considered by the fcc  at any time 
stations also must follow various rules promulgated under the communications act that regulate  among other things  children s television programming and advertising  political advertising  sponsorship identifications  contest and lottery advertising and program ratings guidelines 
the fcc is in the process of determining what  if any  additional public interest programming obligations will be imposed on digital broadcast transmissions 
the fcc determined that broadcasters who carry multiple programs on their digital facilities must provide additional children s educational programming 
the fcc is also charged with enforcing restrictions or prohibitions on the broadcast of obscene and indecent programs and in recent years has increased its enforcement activities in this area  issuing large fines against radio and television stations found to have carried such programming 
congress adopted legislation  which president bush signed into law in june  which increased the maximum monetary penalty for carriage of indecent programming tenfold to  per station per violation and put the licenses of repeat offenders in jeopardy 
we are unable to predict whether the enforcement of these regulations will have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide competitive programming 
the fcc has suggested that violent programming may be regulated in the same manner that indecent programming is now  according to an as yet unadopted fcc report to congress 
it is expected that the fcc will ask congress to grant it the authority to regulate violent content in  as well as ask congress to adopt a definition of excessive violence for the fcc to use in applying those regulations to broadcasters 
we are unable to predict whether the adoption and enforcement of such regulations would have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide competitive programming 
the fcc also requires broadcast stations to comply with its own set of equal employment opportunity outreach rules and has adopted standards regulating the exposure of station employees and the public to potentially harmful radio frequency radiation emitted by our broadcast facilities 
regulatory restrictions on broadcast advertising the advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco on broadcast stations is banned 
congressional committees have examined legislative proposals to eliminate or severely restrict the advertising of beer and wine 
we cannot predict whether any such proposals will be enacted into law and  if so  what the final form of such law might be 
the elimination of all beer and wine advertising could have an adverse effect on our stations revenues and operating profits 
campaign finance legislation  which became effective in november  restricts spending by candidates  political parties  independent groups and others on political advertising and imposes significant reporting and other burdens on political advertising 
this legislation was upheld by the us supreme court  but is subject to further interpretation by the federal elections commission 
the legislation has survived judicial appeals but is still subject to further restrictive interpretation by the federal election commission  whose actions we cannot predict 

table of contents regulatory issues involving cable must carry or retransmission consent rights the cable act of requires television broadcasters to make an election to exercise either must carry or retransmission consent rights in connection with their carriage by cable television systems in the station s local market 
if a broadcaster chooses to exercise its must carry rights  it may demand carriage on a specified channel on cable systems within its local market 
must carry rights are not absolute 
cable systems may decline carriage for a variety of reasons  including a lack of channel capacity for smaller systems  the inability of the station asserting must carry rights to deliver a good quality signal to the cable system or the presence of a more proximate duplicate affiliate of the same network 
stations asserting must carry rights are not permitted to receive additional compensation from the cable systems carrying their stations 
if a station owner chooses to exercise its retransmission consent rights  it may prohibit cable systems from carrying its signal  or permit carriage under a negotiated compensation arrangement 
must carry rights are limited to carriage within a station s local market and preclude a station from receiving anything other than limited carriage rights in exchange for the use of its programming 
must carry is generally elected in instances where the broadcast station believes it is unlikely to obtain either cost free carriage or additional compensation through negotiation 
this is more likely to be the case with respect to stations which have disadvantaged signals or channel positions or which are without strong networks or local news operations and to systems in areas dominated by a single cable operator or where there are overlapping signals from stations in adjacent markets 
otherwise  stations generally elect to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable systems 
a retransmission consent agreement  by contrast  is generally elected where a station seeks not just carriage but compensation from the cable system 
retransmission consent agreements are also required for carriage on systems outside of a station s local market 
compensation may include cash or other forms of payment  enhanced channel position  or carriage of and payment for additional program services such as a local weather service or a second national network carried on a low power station in the same market 
regulatory issues involving dbs systems there are currently in operation two full service dbs systems that serve the us market directv and dish network 
dbs systems provide programming similar to that of cable systems on a subscription basis to those who have purchased and installed a satellite signal receiving dish and associated decoder equipment 
due to limitations in channel capacity and a copyright law restriction limiting distribution of network stations only to areas which could not get terrestrial broadcast signals  dbs systems did not carry local broadcast signals in the local areas served by those stations until recently 
both directv and echostar have substantially increased their channel capacity and congress has amended the satellite compulsory license to permit the satellite carriers to provide local signals in their local markets  congress reaffirmed this local into local provision and the prohibition on importation into local markets of stations from distant markets 
as with cable carriage  broadcasters have been given the right to negotiate retransmission consent for these local signals in exchange for compensation or  where local service has been initiated  to demand carriage as a matter of right for no compensation 
both directv and echostar have now initiated carriage of local stations in most of our markets 
regulatory network affiliate issues several fcc rules impose restrictions on network affiliation agreements 
among other things  those rules prohibit a television station from entering into any affiliation agreement that requires the station to clear time for network programming that the station had previously scheduled for other use  or 
table of contents precludes the preemption of any network programs that the station believes are unsuitable for its audience and the substitution of network programming with programming that it believes is of greater local or national importance 
the fcc is currently reviewing its rules governing the relationship between broadcast television networks and their affiliates 
we are unable to predict when and how the fcc will resolve these matters 
regulatory issues involving the transition to digital television all us television stations broadcast signals using an analog transmission system first developed in the s 
the fcc has approved a new digital television  or dtv  technical standard to be used by television broadcasters  television set manufacturers  the computer industry and the motion picture industry 
this dtv standard allows the simultaneous transmission of higher quality and or multiple streams of video programming and data on the bandwidth presently used by a single analog channel 
on the multiple channels allowed by dtv  it is possible to broadcast one high definition channel  with visual and sound quality substantially superior to present day television  to transmit several standard definition channels  with digital sound and pictures of a quality varying from equivalent to somewhat better than present television  to provide interactive data services  including visual or audio transmission  or to provide some combination of these possibilities 
the fcc has already allocated to nearly every existing television broadcast station one additional channel to be used for dtv during the transition between present day analog television and dtv  and has established a timetable by which every current station must initiate dtv operations 
broadcasters were not required to pay for this new dtv channel  but will be required to relinquish their analog channel on february  the fcc has declared its intention to place all dtv stations in a core broadcast band consisting of channels by february  and to reallocate channels to a variety of other uses  including advanced cellular telephone and public safety 
in september and june  the fcc auctioned off much of the spectrum now occupied by broadcast channels  and the channels can be used for any purpose other than analog television and cannot be used until vacated by any incumbent broadcasters 
we participated in the auction and purchased this spectrum in several of our markets  including those markets where we have either an analog or a digital broadcast channel or on february   a measure was signed into law requiring the fcc to auction off the remaining spectrum by january  and requiring all analog broadcast transmissions to cease by february  the measure also provided for a subsidy to provide free digital converters to consumers with analog receivers who depend on over the air service and do not subscribe to cable or satellite service 
broadcasters must also pay certain fees for nonbroadcast uses of their digital channels 
in addition  the fcc recently determined that broadcasters who transmit multiple programs on their digital channels are required to carry additional children s educational programming and is evaluating whether to impose further public interest programming requirements on digital broadcasters 
the fcc also recently held that the must carry requirements applicable to cable and satellite carriage of analog broadcast signals will encompass only the primary digital program channel and then only upon the cessation of analog signals 
in some cases  conversion to digital operations may reduce a station s geographical coverage area 
moreover  some of our stations have channels that are in the spectrum to be cleared for resale by the fcc and it is likely  but with no guarantee  that the replacement channels will fully replicate existing service 
in most instances  our digital service may exceed the current service we provide 
in addition  the fcc s current implementation plan would maintain the secondary status of low power television stations with respect to dtv operations and many low power television stations  particularly in major markets  will be displaced  including some of ours 

table of contents pursuant to the telecommunications act  the fcc must conduct a ten year evaluation regarding the public interest in advanced television  alternative uses for the spectrum and reduction of the amount of spectrum each licensee utilizes 
many segments of the industry are also intensely studying these advanced technologies 
there can be no assurances regarding the nature of future fcc regulation as a result of this study 
recent regulatory developments  proposed legislation and regulation congress and the fcc currently have under consideration  and may in the future adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect  directly or indirectly  the operation and ownership of our stations 
in addition to the changes and proposed changes noted above  the fcc has considered  for example  spectrum use fees  political advertising rates and potential restrictions on the advertising of certain products like hard liquor  beer and wine that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
other matters that could affect the stations include technological innovations and development generally affecting competition in the mass communications industry 
the foregoing does not purport to be a complete summary of all the provisions of the communications act  as amended by the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act or the cable act  or of the regulations and policies of the fcc under either act 
proposals for additional or revised regulations and requirements are pending before and are being considered by congress and federal regulatory agencies from time to time 
we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of any of the pending fcc rulemaking proceedings referenced above  the outcome of any reconsideration or appellate proceedings concerning any changes in fcc rules or policies noted above  the possible outcome of any proposed or pending congressional legislation  or the impact of any of those changes on our stations

item a 
risk factors risks associated with our business activities our operating results are primarily dependent on advertising revenues  which can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control 
as a result  we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns than businesses in other industries 
our operating results are primarily dependent on advertising revenue  which can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control 
this volatility affects our operating results and may make it difficult for us to repay our debt obligations or cause the value of our common stock to decline 
our ability to generate advertising revenues depends on factors such as national and local economic conditions  the relative popularity of the programming on our stations  the demographic characteristics of our markets  and the activities of our competitors 
our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership or we may not achieve favorable ratings 
our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
a shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity  which could cause our advertising revenues to decline 
we  and those on whom we rely for programming  may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in viewer tastes and interests of our local markets 
in addition  political advertising revenue from elections and advertising revenues from olympic games  which generally occur on the even years  create large fluctuations in our operating results on a year to year basis 
we depend to a significant degree on automotive advertising 
approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted of automotive advertising 
a significant decrease in these revenues in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows  which could affect our ability to fund operations and service our debt obligations and affect the value of our common stock 
if we are unable to reach retransmission consent agreements with cable and other pay television companies for the carriage of our stations signals  we could lose audience share and revenues 
in connection with the distribution of local broadcast television station signals to cable television and other pay television service subscribers in individual markets  the communications act permits the stations to choose either mandatory carriage must carry or retransmission consent 
under must carry  the station informs the cable or pay television company that the station s signal is required to be distributed to the company s subscribers  but there is no compensation to the station for such distribution 
under retransmission consent  the station notifies the local cable or pay television company that it elects to begin negotiations to determine if they can agree on the economic terms under which the cable or pay television company will be given permission to distribute the broadcast station s signals  analog  hd  or both  to the company s subscribers 
if no agreement is reached  the cable or pay television company cannot distribute the station s signal to its subscribers and the broadcast station must rely on its over the air signal and other forms of competitive distribution dbs and telecommunications to reach its audience and provide programming and advertising 

table of contents if we enter into retransmission consent negotiations with a number of local cable and pay television companies but are unable to reach agreement with respect to economic terms for the carriage of our station signals  our local television station audience  ratings and advertising revenues could substantially decline and there could be a material adverse impact to our results of operations 
we have a substantial amount of debt  which could adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  reduce our operating flexibility and put us at greater risk for default and acceleration of our debt 
as of december   we had approximately million of consolidated indebtedness and approximately million of consolidated stockholders equity 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
accordingly  we will continue to have significant debt service obligations 
our large amount of indebtedness could  for example require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on indebtedness and reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate activities  require us to dispose of television stations or other assets at times or on terms that may be less advantageous than those we might otherwise be able to obtain  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  expose us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rates on our credit facility vary  and impair our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general and place us at a disadvantage relative to our less leveraged competitors 
in addition  our debt instruments require us to comply with covenants  including  among others  those that restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations and make capital expenditures 
these covenants restrict the manner in which we conduct our business and may impact our operating results 
further  our failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default  which  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of our indebtedness under our debt agreements or under other instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
in the past  we have obtained amendments with respect to compliance with financial ratio tests in our credit facility 
consents or amendments that may be required in the future may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
our indentures also have change of control provisions which may require us to purchase all or a portion of our senior subordinated notes and our senior subordinated notes class b at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and our exchangeable senior subordinated debentures at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
the holders of our exchangeable senior subordinated debentures can also require us to repurchase all or a portion of the debentures  totalling million  on each of may     and any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity and results of operations 
we have a history of net losses and a substantial accumulated deficit 
we had net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily as a result of impairment of our broadcast licenses and goodwill  and interest expense 
in addition  as of december  and  we had accumulated deficits of and million  respectively 
these losses may or may not recur  and our net losses and 
table of contents accumulated deficit may therefore continue indefinitely 
as a result  we may not have sufficient funds to operate our business 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations  forcing us to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  or to pay interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness  will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  will be subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  we may have to seek to restructure our remaining debt obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and the market  if any  for our debt 
we have a material amount of intangible assets and we have recorded substantial impairments in prior periods 
future write downs of intangible assets would reduce net income  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our class a common stock 
approximately billion  or  of our total assets as of december  consists of unamortized intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires  among other things  that goodwill and certain other intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually  with impairment being measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or the intangible asset over its fair value 
in addition  goodwill and intangible assets will be tested more often for impairment as circumstances warrant 
future impairment charges could significantly adversely impact our reported results of operations and stockholders equity 
we recorded an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million during the year ended december  and we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our class a common stock traded at a price that resulted in a market capitalization less than our total stockholders equity as of december   and has done so since april if we determine in a future period as part of our testing for impairments of intangible assets and goodwill  that the carrying amount of our intangible assets exceeds the fair market of value of these assets  we may incur an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our class a common stock 
our strategy has historically included seeking growth through acquisitions of television stations  which could pose various risks and increase our leverage 
we have pursued and intend to selectively continue to pursue acquisitions of television stations with the goal of improving their operating performance by applying our management s business and growth strategy 
we acquired seven television stations during the last two years 
we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets nor have the financial capacity to complete additional station acquisitions 
acquisitions involve inherent risks  such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following any acquisitions 
we may not be able to successfully implement effective cost controls  increase advertising revenues or increase audience share with respect to any acquired stations 
in addition  future acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities and may result in the diversion of management s attention from the operation of our core business 

table of contents in addition  television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest some television stations if the fcc believes that a proposed acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations 
broadcast interests of our affiliates  including hicks muse  may be attributable to us and may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets  restricting our ability to execute our growth strategy 
the number of television stations we may acquire in any market is limited by fcc rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of persons affiliated with us are attributable to those persons under fcc rules 
the fcc generally applies its ownership limits to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association 
the broadcast or other media interests of our officers  directors and or greater voting stockholders are generally attributable to us  which may limit our acquisition or ownership of television stations in particular markets while those officers  directors or stockholders are associated with us 
in addition  the holder of an otherwise nonattributable equity or debt interest in a licensee which is in excess of of the total debt and equity of the licensee will nonetheless be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station or newspaper in the same market 
as of march   affiliates of hicks muse owned  shares of our nonvoting class b common stock  which represents of our capital stock  and one share of our class c common stock  which represents less than of our capital stock  but represents of the outstanding voting power 
hicks muse and its affiliates  whose interests may differ from your interests  have approval rights with respect to significant transactions and could convert their equity interests in our company into a majority of voting power  thereby reducing the voting power of our other shareholders 
hicks muse and its affiliates own one share of our class c common stock  which represents of our outstanding voting power  and also have the ability to convert shares of our nonvoting class b common stock into class a common stock  subject to fcc approval 
upon the conversion of the majority of the nonvoting class b common stock into class a common stock  the class c common stock will automatically convert into an equal number of shares of class a common stock 
if this occurs  affiliates of hicks muse would own approximately of our voting equity interests and will effectively have the ability to elect the entire board of directors and to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
the interests of hicks muse and its affiliates may differ from the interests of our other stockholders and hicks muse and its affiliates could take actions or make decisions that are not in the best interests of our other stockholders 
for example  hicks muse is in the business of making significant investments in existing or newly formed companies and may from time to time acquire and hold controlling or non controlling interests in television broadcast assets that may directly or indirectly compete with our company for advertising revenues 
hicks muse and its affiliates may from time to time identify  pursue and consummate acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast related businesses that may be complementary to our business and therefore such acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
moreover  royal w 
carson  iii  a director  and hicks muse together own all of our class c common stock and therefore possess of the combined voting power 
accordingly  mr 
carson and hicks muse together have the power to elect our entire board of directors and  through this control  to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
mr

table of contents incorporated  an investment firm that sponsors funds of funds and dedicated funds that have invested substantially all of the net capital of these funds in investment funds sponsored by hicks muse or its affiliates 
mr

in addition  peter s 
brodsky  a director of our company  is a partner of hm capital partners llc  an affiliate of hicks muse 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue could decline 
the entertainment industry  and particularly the television industry  is highly competitive and is undergoing a period of consolidation and significant change 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment alternatives  such as cable television  internet services  wireless cable  satellite to home distribution services  pay per view  digital video recorders  dvds and home video and entertainment systems and mobile video devices have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over the air television broadcast stations to new types of competition 
in addition  as a result of the telecommunications act  the legislative ban on telephone cable ownership has been repealed and telephone companies are now permitted to seek fcc approval to provide video services to homes 
new technologies may affect our broadcasting operations 
our television broadcasting business is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  and the emergence of new technologies 
we cannot predict the effect such technologies will have on our broadcast operations  but the capital expenditures necessary to implement these new technologies could be substantial and other companies employing such technologies before we are able to could aggressively compete with our business 
it will be difficult to take us over  which could adversely affect the trading price of our class a common stock 
affiliates of hicks muse effectively determine whether a change of control will occur through their ownership rights of one of the two outstanding shares of class c common stock and all of the shares of our class b common stock 
provisions of delaware corporate law and our bylaws and certificate of incorporation  including the voting power rights of our class c common stock held by mr 
carson and hicks muse and the voting power that affiliates of hicks muse would hold upon conversion of their shares of class b stock into class a stock or class c stock  make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control would benefit the holders of class a common stock 
these provisions and controlling ownership by affiliates of hicks muse could also adversely affect the public trading price of our class a common stock 
the loss of network affiliation agreements or changes in network affiliations could materially and adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to quickly replace the network affiliation 
the non renewal or termination of a network affiliation agreement or a change in network affiliations could have a material adverse effect on us 
each of the networks generally provides our affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week 
in return  our stations broadcast network inserted commercials during that programming and  in some cases  receive cash payments from networks  and in other cases  we make cash payments to certain networks 
in addition  some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances  including as a result of a change of control of our company  which would generally result upon the acquisition of of our voting power 
in the event that affiliates of hicks muse elect to convert our class b common stock shares held by them into shares of 
table of contents either class a common stock or class c common stock  such conversion may result in a change of control of our company causing an early termination of some or all of our network affiliation agreements 
some of the networks with which our stations are affiliated have required us  upon renewal of affiliation agreements  to reduce or eliminate network affiliation compensation and  in specific cases  to make cash payments to the network  and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements 
consequently  our affiliation agreements may not all remain in place and each network may not continue to provide programming or compensation to us on the same basis as it currently provides programming or compensation to our stations 
if any of our stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with networks for any reason  we would need to find alternative sources of programming  which may be less attractive and more expensive 
a change in network affiliation in a given television market may have many short term and long term consequences  depending upon the circumstances surrounding the change 
potential short term consequences include increased marketing costs and increased internal operating costs  which can vary widely depending on the amount of marketing required to educate the audience regarding the change and to maintain the station s viewing audience  short term loss of market share or slower market growth due to advertiser uncertainty about the switch  costs of building a new or larger news operation and other increases in station programming costs  if necessary  and the cost of the equipment needed to conform the station s programming  equipment and logos to the new network affiliation 
long term consequences are more difficult to assess  due to the cyclical nature of each of the major network s share of the audience that changes from year to year with programs coming to the end of their production cycle and the audience acceptance of new programs in the future and the fact that national network audience ratings are not necessarily indicative of how a network s programming is accepted in an individual market 
how well a particular network fares in the affiliation switch depends largely on the value of the broadcast license  which is influenced by the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting  whether it is a vhf or a uhf license  the quality and location of the license  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station and the quality of the other station s non network programming 
in addition  the majority of the revenue earned by television stations is attributable to locally produced news and syndicated programming  rather than to network affiliation payments and advertising sales related to network programming 
the circumstances that may surround a network affiliation switch cause uncertainty as to the actual costs that will be incurred by us and  if these costs are significant  the switch could have a material adverse impact on the income we derive from the affected station 
the use of an alternative method of valuing our network affiliations could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 
some broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we use 
these different assumptions may result in the use of different valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets among broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market  the length of time that the broadcast license has been broadcasting  whether the station is a vhf station or a uhf station  the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within the market  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station  and the quality of non network programming carried by a station 

table of contents we generally have acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we have used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired is based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in substantially all our markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to the television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in substantially all of the markets in which we operate  beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more or less favorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
some broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that vhf stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
if we were to adopt this alternative method for valuing network affiliations  the value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill as reported on our balance sheet would be reduced and the value of our other intangible assets would be proportionately increased 
as a result  our expenses relating to the amortization of intangible assets could increase significantly as more value would be assigned to an amortizing asset and this increase could materially reduce our operating income and materially increase our net loss 
in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from those attributable to our existing stations due to different attributes of each station and the market in which it operates 
the gecc note could result in significant liabilities and could trigger a change of control under our existing indebtedness  causing our indebtedness to become immediately due and payable 
gecc  a subsidiary of general electric company  provided debt financing for a joint venture between us and nbc universal  another subsidiary of general electric company  in the form of an million  non amortizing senior secured note due  which is an obligation of the joint venture and not us 
in the event that such note is not extended or otherwise refinanced when the note matures in  we expect that  assuming current federal marginal tax rates remain in effect  our tax liability related to the joint venture transaction will be approximately million 
the formation of the joint venture was intended to be tax free to us 
however  any early repayment of the note will accelerate this tax liability  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
annual cash interest payments on the note are approximately million 
there are no scheduled payments of principal due prior to  the stated maturity of the note 
the obligations under the note were assumed by the joint venture  and the proceeds of the note were used to finance a portion of the cost of hicks muse s acquisition of lin television corporation 
the note is not our obligation nor the obligation of any of our subsidiaries and has recourse only to the joint venture  our equity interest in the joint venture and  after exhausting all remedies against the assets of the joint venture and the other equity interest in the joint venture  to our company pursuant to a guarantee  which could trigger the change of control provisions under our existing indebtedness 
an event of default under the note will occur if the joint venture fails to make any scheduled payment of interest  within days of the date due and payable  or principal of the note on the maturity date 
the joint venture had cash 
table of contents balances at december  of million for the purpose of making interest payments on the note when due 
both nbc universal and us have the right to make a shortfall loan to the joint venture to cover any interest payment 
however  if the joint venture fails to pay principal or interest on the note  and neither nbc universal nor us make a shortfall loan to cover the interest payment  an event of default would occur under the note and gecc could accelerate the maturity of the entire amount due under the note 
other than the acceleration of the principal amount of the note upon an event of default  prepayment of the principal of the note is prohibited prior to its stated maturity 
risks related to our industry our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs  and increased programming costs could adversely affect our operating results 
our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs 
we often acquire program rights two or three years in advance  making it difficult for us to accurately predict how a program will perform 
in some instances  we may have to replace programs before their costs have been fully amortized  resulting in impairments and write offs that increase station operating costs 
we may be exposed in the future to increased programming costs  which may adversely affect our operating results 
our industry is subject to a government mandated analog to digital conversion process which may cause us to lose viewership and advertising revenues 
federal legislation now requires us to cease all analog transmissions by february  approximately of all television households now receive television exclusively by means of over the air transmissions such as those transmitted by our stations and millions of additional households who subscribe to cable or dbs also have additional receivers which receive over the air transmissions 
households without dbs or cable service are substantially greater viewers of local stations such as ours than dbs or cable households 
the federal government has created a subsidy for households with analog over the air receivers to receive free digital converters 
the subsidy may not be large enough to cover all households with over the air receivers and a significant percentage of such households may not learn of or choose to take advantage of the subsidy 
as a result  the transition to digital may cause some households to lose service and induce others to subscribe to satellite or cable service  reducing our viewership and advertising revenues 
implementation of digital television improves the technical quality of over the air broadcast television 
however  conversion to digital operations may reduce a station s geographical coverage area 
we believe that digital television is essential to our long term viability and that of the broadcast industry  but we cannot predict the precise effect digital television might have on our business 
the fcc has levied fees on broadcasters with respect to non broadcast uses of digital channels  including data transmissions or subscriber services 
further advances in technology may also increase competition for household audiences and advertisers 
we are unable to predict the effect that technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or the future results of our operations 
changes in fcc ownership rules through fcc action  judicial review or federal legislation may limit our ability to continue providing services to stations under local marketing agreements  may prevent us from obtaining ownership of the stations we currently provide services to under local marketing agreements and or may preclude us from obtaining the full economic value of one or more of our two station operations upon a sale  merger or other similar transaction transferring ownership of such station or stations 
fcc ownership rules currently impose significant limitations on the ability of broadcast licensees to have attributable interests in multiple media properties 
in addition  federal law prohibits one company from owning broadcast television stations that collectively have service areas encompassing more than an aggregate share of national television households 
ownership restrictions under fcc rules also include a variety of local limits on media ownership 
the restrictions include an ownership 
table of contents limit of one television station in most medium and smaller television markets and two stations in most larger markets  known as the television duopoly rule 
the regulations also include a prohibition on the common ownership of a newspaper and television station in the same market newspaper television cross ownership  limits on common ownership of radio and television stations in the same market radio television station ownership and limits on radio ownership of four to eight radio stations in a local market 
in  the fcc voted to revise and  in most cases  substantially liberalize several of its national and local ownership rules 
in  the united states court of appeals found virtually all of these actions to be without adequate support and remanded to the fcc for further deliberation 
in  the united states supreme court declined to hear an appeal of the court of appeals decision 
in june the fcc adopted a further rulemaking proceeding to reexamine the ownership rules in light of the court decision 
that proceeding is ongoing 
we are unable to predict the timing or outcome of any fcc deliberations 
should the fcc s amended rules ultimately become effective  attractive opportunities may arise for additional television station and other media acquisitions 
but these changes also create additional competition for us from other entities  such as national broadcast networks  large station groups  newspaper chains and cable operators who may be better positioned to take advantage of such changes and benefit from the resulting operating synergies both nationally and in specific markets 
should the television duopoly rule become relaxed  we may be able to acquire the ownership of one or both of the stations in austin and providence for which we currently provide programming  sales and other related services under local marketing agreements and for which we have purchase option agreements to purchase these stations 
should we be unable to do so  there is no assurance that the grandfathering of our local marketing agreements will be permitted beyond conclusion of the current further rulemaking 
we had net revenues of million  or  of our total net revenues  attributable to local marketing agreements for the year ended december  any potential hostilities or terrorist attacks may affect our revenues and results of operations 
if the united states becomes engaged in new  large scale foreign hostilities or if there is a terrorist attack against the united states  we may lose advertising revenue and incur increased broadcasting expenses due to pre emption  delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns and the increased costs of providing coverage of such events 
we cannot predict the extent and duration of any future disruption to our programming schedule  the amount of advertising revenue that would be lost or delayed or the amount by which our broadcasting expenses would increase as a result 
as a result  any related future loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively effect our results of operations

we lease the remaining properties  consisting primarily of sales office locations and microwave transmitter sites 
while none of the station properties owned or leased by us are individually material to our operations  if we were required to relocate any of our towers  the cost could be significant because the number of sites in any

executive summary our company owns and operates and or programs television stations in mid sized markets in the united states 
our operating revenues are derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  national and political advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from other broadcast related activities 
we recorded net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to net income of million in the following are some of our operating highlights for compared to our gross local advertising revenues  excluding political advertising revenues  increased by in primarily due to the and acquisitions 
local advertising revenues represented  and of total advertising revenues for the years  and  respectively 
our gross national advertising revenues  excluding political advertising revenues  increased by for primarily due to the and acquisitions 
national advertising revenues represented  and of total advertising revenues for the years  and  respectively 
our gross political advertising revenues were million for of which million were national and million were local 
political advertising revenues represented  and of total advertising revenues for the years  and  respectively 
our digital revenues  which include revenues generated by our internet websites and retransmission consent fees  increased to million in compared to million in and million in our television stations currently operate websites that cumulatively achieve over million unique visitors and million page views per month 
during our second quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million  comprised of a broadcast license impairment of million relating to fifteen of our television stations and a goodwill impairment of million 
we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million for the year ended december   pursuant to our board of directors approved stock repurchase program 
on july   we announced the appointment of vincent l 
sadusky as president and chief executive officer 
in connection with the retirement of our former chief executive officer  we recorded a million severance expense  including million of stock based compensation  in the year ended december  in the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment of million for our entire investment in us digital television llc usdtv  which filed for bankruptcy protection on july  on october   we entered into an agreement to sell our puerto rico operations  including wapa tv  wjpx tv and wapa america  to intermedia partners vii  lp  intermedia for million in cash  subject to certain closing adjustments 
the transaction is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of 
table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million as part of an approved plan to centralize accounting for all of our owned and operated stations and to eliminate or reduce other contractual and lease costs 
the plan included a workforce reduction of employees primarily from station accounting offices 
industry trends the broadcast television industry is primarily reliant on advertising revenues and faces increased competition largely from new technologies 
the following summarizes certain of the developments  competitive forces  and risks that may impact our future operating results 
for a discussion of other factors that may affect our business  see item a 
risk factors 
on february   the president signed into law a measure requiring the fcc to auction off the remaining analog broadcasting spectrum by january  and requiring all analog broadcast transmissions to cease by february  the measure also provided for a subsidy to provide free digital converters to consumers with analog receivers who depend on over the air service and do not subscribe to cable or satellite service 
networks have increasingly made the renewal or extension of affiliation agreements contingent upon a reduction or eventual elimination of network compensation payments and  in certain contract extensions  have required broadcast stations to pay compensation to the network 
in addition  upn and wb networks ceased operating as a network after september  and two new networks were launched  the cw television network and mynetworktv 
fragmentation of all media resulting from the growth of the internet and the proliferation in the number of national program services  together with industry consolidation for a number of larger advertising categories  has increased the competition for and impacted the pool of available national advertising dollars  resulting in a decline of our national advertising revenues 
excluding political advertising  we received of our advertising revenues from national advertisers in compared to in we expect this trend to continue 
we no longer have exclusive rights to off network programs for time periods where we do not air our local news or network programs 
many of these programs now air on national cable channels or can be purchased on dvds or via downloads to computers and mobile video devices by our television audience 
this causes a further fragmentation of our television audience making it more difficult to maintain or increase the rates we charge our advertisers 
political revenues from elections and revenues from olympic games  which generally occur on the even years  continue to create large fluctuations in our operating results on a year to year basis 
according to the television bureau of advertising  i us television advertising increased in due largely to political advertising  ii us television advertising decreased in due largely to the loss of political advertising and iii us television advertising increased in due largely to political advertising and advertising in the olympic games 
we depend on automotive related advertising that represented approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a significant change in these advertising revenues could materially affect our future results of operations 
business transactions we have developed our business through a combination of acquisitions  dispositions and organic growth 
we had the following business transactions during wbpg tv acquisition on july   we completed our acquisition of the assets of wbpg tv  including the broadcast license  for million 
since november  we had been providing services to this station under a local marketing agreement 

table of contents kasa tv acquisition on july   we signed an agreement to acquire the station assets  including the broadcast licenses  of kasa tv  the fox affiliate in albuquerque  from raycom media  inc for million in cash and began providing programming  sales and other related services for kasa tv under a local marketing agreement on september  the acquisition was completed on february  we have consolidated the operating results and financial position of kasa tv under the consolidation principles of fin r in our consolidated financial statements since the third quarter of we have combined the studios and operations of kasa tv with our other albuquerque station  krqe tv 
puerto rico disposition on october   we agreed to sell our puerto rico operations to intermedia partners vii  lp for million in cash 
the sale is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of accordingly  this discussion reflects our puerto rico operations as discontinued for all periods presented 
during and we acquired  exchanged or disposed of the following businesses and assets type of date station business transaction transaction price emmis stations acquisition million krqe tv wala tv wluk tv wthi tv viacom stations acquisition million wndy tv wwho tv weyi tv disposition million as part of this transaction  we also began providing programming  sales and other related services under a local marketing agreement to wbpg tv  the cw affiliate serving mobile pensacola  on november  and we secured a purchase option for million to acquire the station from emmis upon fcc approval 
critical accounting policies  estimates and recently issued accounting pronouncements certain of our accounting policies  as well as estimates we make  are critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations since they are particularly sensitive to our judgment 
some of these policies and estimates relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the estimates and judgments we make affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  program rights  income taxes  stock based compensation  pensions  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and it is possible that such differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates discussed below are particularly critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have discussed each of these critical accounting policies and related estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets approximately billion  or  of our total assets as of december  consisted of unamortized intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
as required by sfas  we test the impairment of our broadcast licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of broadcast licenses with their carrying amount on a station by station basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method  assuming a hypothetical startup scenario that excludes network compensation payments 
also as required by sfas  we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a station with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of a station is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect historical performance of the station and prevailing values in the markets for broadcasting properties 
if the fair value of the station exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the station exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation  using the station s fair value as determined in the first step described above as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess but not more than the carrying value of goodwill 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during the second quarter of that included a broadcast license impairment of million relating to fifteen of our television stations and a goodwill impairment of million 
as required by sfas  we performed interim quarterly tests because we determined that events had occurred and circumstances had changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below the carrying amounts 
as a result of the continued decline in the trading price of our class a common stock  the departure of our former chief executive officer and the availability of updated market financial information  we tested our broadcast licenses and goodwill for impairments as of june  we used market information not available as of december  to calculate the fair value of our broadcast licenses and reporting units 
the impairment tests performed during the second quarter of  used the same assumptions as disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   except that the discount rate used in determining the enterprise valuation was adjusted from to  market growth ranged from to  and operating profit margins ranged from to 
as required by sfas  we have performed our annual test for impairment of broadcast licenses and goodwill as of december   and as a result of these annual tests no impairment was recorded as of december  and and an impairment of million was recorded as of december  the assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our business plans and overall expectations as to market and economic considerations 

table of contents we based the valuation of broadcast licenses on the following basic assumptions for the years ended december market revenue growth to to operating profit margins to to discount rate tax rate to to capitalization rate to to regarding potential changes to these assumptions and the potential impact on the december  carrying values of our broadcast licenses  if we were to decrease the market revenue growth by one percent and by half of the projected growth rate  we would incur an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million  respectively 
if we were to decrease the operating profit margins by and from the projected operating profit margins  we would incur no impairment of our broadcast licenses 
if we were to increase the discount rate used in the valuation calculation by and  we would incur an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million  respectively 
our company based the valuation of goodwill on the following basic assumptions for the years ended december market revenue growth to to operating profit margins to to discount rate tax rate to to capitalization rate to to regarding potential changes to these assumptions and the potential impact on the december  carrying value of our goodwill  if we were to decrease the market revenue growth by one percent and by half of the projected growth rate  the enterprise value of our reporting units would decrease by million and million  respectively 
if we were to decrease the operating profit margins by and from the projected operating profit margins  the enterprise value of our reporting units would decrease by million and million  respectively 
if we were to increase the discount rate used in the valuation calculation by and  the enterprise value of our reporting units would decrease by million and million  respectively 
in addition  we would then be required to take these enterprise values to the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill million at december  
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by a notional reperformance of the purchase price allocation using the station s fair value as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
network affiliations different broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we use 
these different assumptions may result in the use of different valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets between broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local 
table of contents television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
these attributes and their impact on audiences can include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market determines how many television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market 
the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting 
television stations that have been broadcasting since the late s  generally channels two to thirteen  are viewed more often than newer television stations 
vhf stations  generally channels two to thirteen are typically viewed more often than uhf stations generally channels fourteen to sixty nine because these stations have been broadcasting longer than uhf stations and because of the inferior uhf signal in the early years of uhf stations 
the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within a market ie the value of being licensed in the smallest city within a tri city market has less value than being licensed in the largest city within a tri city market 
the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station 
the local television station s news programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide a larger audience for its network programming 
the quality of the other non network programming carried by the television station 
a local television station s syndicated programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide larger audience lead ins to its network programming 
a local television station can be the top rated station in a market  regardless of the national ranking of its affiliated network  depending on the factors or attributes listed above 
abc  fox  nbc  and cbs each have affiliations with local television stations that have the largest prime time audience in the local market in which the station operates regardless of the network s prime time rating 
some broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that vhf stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 

table of contents if we were to assign higher values to our acquired network affiliation agreements and  therefore  less value to our broadcast licenses  it would have a significant impact on our operating results 
the following chart reflects the hypothetical impact of the reassignment of value from broadcast licenses to network affiliations and the resulting increase in amortization expense assuming a year amortization period for the year ended december  in thousands  except per share data percentage of total value of broadcast licenses reassigned to network affiliation agreements as reported balance sheet as of december  broadcast licenses other intangible assets  net including network affiliation agreements statement of operations year ended december  depreciation and amortization of intangible assets operating loss loss from continuing operations net loss net loss per diluted share we generally have acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired is based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in substantially all our markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to our television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in substantially all our markets in which we operate beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from those attributable to our existing stations due to different attributes of each station and the market in which it operates 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such a determination was made 
in the fourth quarter of  we reversed our tax valuation allowance related to federal income taxes which resulted in a million increase in our benefit from income taxes 
we made the determination that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized in the future based on the positive evidence of our historical performance over the last three years and our projections for 
table of contents future results of operations 
lower interest rates compared to prior years and increased operating results from our stations acquired from viacom and emmis were key factors in our determination 
revenue recognition we recognize advertising and other program related revenue during the financial statement period in which advertising or programs are aired on our television stations or carried by our internet websites 
we recognize retransmission consent fees at the time those services are performed 
barter revenue is accounted for at the fair value of the assets or services received  or the advertising time surrendered  whichever is more clearly evident 
barter revenue is recorded at the time the advertising is broadcast  and barter expense is recorded at the time the assets or services are used 
we recognized barter revenue in the amounts of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we incurred barter expense in the amounts of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation on october   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r and its related implementation guidance in accounting for stock based employee compensation arrangements 
this statement requires us to estimate the fair value of stock based awards exchanged for employee services and recognize compensation cost based on this fair value over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas r  the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
and prior period pro forma disclosures of net earnings  including stock based compensation as determined under a fair value method as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables to be assumed in the calculation  including the option s expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock and the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
price volatility is based on historical volatilities of our class a common stock and expected forfeitures are estimated using our historical experience and the common stock of peer group companies engaged in the broadcasting business 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents the following table presents the stock based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of income and recognized in accordance with sfas no

prior to october   we accounted for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by apb and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recorded for options issued to employees in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant in these periods 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
through disclosure only 
the following table illustrates the effect on net loss income if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no

program rights are analyzed by management on an ongoing basis through a review of ratings  program schedules and revenue projections  among other factors 
if the projected future net revenues are less than the current carrying value of the program rights  we write down the program rights to equal the amount of projected future net revenues 
our total program rights were million and million at december  and  respectively 
retirement plan actuarial assumptions our retirement benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of sfas no 
employer s accounting for pensions sfas no 

two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions involve employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increase 
we have a number of noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of our employees 
contributions are based on period actuarial valuations and are charged to operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current employees 
the net pension expense is assessed in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified actuaries 
the benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on years of service and compensation 
the selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense or income involves significant judgment 
our long term return on asset roa and discount rate assumptions are considered the key variables in determining pension expense or income 
to develop the long term roa assumption  we considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which we invested pension plan assets  and the expectations for future returns of each asset class 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based upon an asset allocation within our policy allocation ranges to develop the long term roa assumption 
our policy asset allocation ranges are between and for equities and between and for debt securities 
the long term roa assumption for our pension plans in is  unchanged from and the actual roa  based upon actuarial values was and for years ended december  and  respectively 
the discount rate assumption was determined by selecting a rate that would reflect the weighted rate on a theoretical high quality bond portfolio that would closely match the various durations of our pension liability duration 
our plan has an average duration consistent with a typical  ongoing pension plan 
accordingly  we look to the moody s aa rate as an appropriate benchmark 
the discount rate assumption for our pension plans in is  compared to the discount rate of for and for our pension expense is expected to be approximately million in for every that the actual pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term roa 
table of contents assumption for  our pension expense for would change by approximately million 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption for would increase or decrease our pension expense for by approximately million 
we do not currently have minimum funding requirements  as set forth in erisa and federal tax laws 
we contributed million and million to the retirement plans in and  respectively 
we anticipate contributing approximately million to the retirement plans in in addition  we have million of pension deferred actuarial losses resulting from changes in discount rates  differences between actual and assumed asset returns and differences between actual and assumed demographic experience actual earnings  rates of turnover and retirement 
these losses are amortized and included in future pension expense over the average employee service period of approximately five years 
although they are included in the liabilities disclosed in note retirement plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  they have not yet been reflected on our balance sheet
