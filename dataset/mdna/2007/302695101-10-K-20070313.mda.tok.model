item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
introduction as a result of the very different characteristics of our two major operating areas the us and poland  our financial results show a distinct dichotomy 
our us operations are relatively mature  while our polish operations are early in their initial development 
see results of operations by business segment below 
through  most of our oil and gas production  revenues and lease operating expenses have been attributable to our us operations 
the same is true of our oilfield service revenues and costs 
our us operations have been the source of essentially all of our operating cash flow 
these operations are relatively stable  with only modest growth or decline on an annual basis 
most of our exploration costs have been attributable to our efforts in poland 
we expect our polish operations will continue to represent the bulk of our exploration costs  reflecting the nature of our exploration efforts there 
however  with our recent commencement of oil and gas production in poland in late  we expect these operations will begin to contribute significantly to our revenues  lease operating expenses and depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
consequently  our results through may not be indicative of our future operations 
following is a brief discussion concerning certain significant events in poland that occurred during commencement of polish gas production our exploration efforts in poland have led to our first meaningful production in  as we began producing and selling gas from two of our drilling successes  the wilga and zaniemysl wells 
after spending almost a year obtaining permits  designing and constructing the production facilities and preparing the necessary sales and operating agreements  production at our wilga well  located southeast of warsaw  officially commenced on september th  and production began at our zaniemysl well  located in western poland  on october th 
zaniemysl production at the zaniemysl well reached its targeted initial production rate of mmcfd in early november  and has remained essentially constant since that time 
we contracted with pogc for zaniemysl gas sales nearly a year ago with a base price of approximately per mcf 
the contract  which is for the life of the field  contains an escalator clause based on consumer gas prices in poland 
as of january   we were selling gas at the wellhead at a price of per mcf at current exchange rates 
at this price and assuming the well maintains its targeted production rate  we believe we will realize gross revenues of approximately million from our share of the well in we plan to conduct a detailed reservoir test after six months of plateau production 
this test  together with the production up to that point  will allow us to measure reserves with greater accuracy than is possible today and help us to decide whether to drill an offset well 
at december   the zaniemysl well had approximately bcf of gross proved reserves bcf net to our interest  but based upon d seismic data and study to date  we believe that the reservoir contains significant additional reserves that may be captured through a second well on the structure 
wilga the wilga well has been a complex engineering endeavor 
the well is capable of producing approximately mmcf and between and barrels of lco per day from each of the three zones 
our plan is to produce two zones simultaneously  when conditions permit  switching one out every six months so that each zone will be on for twelve months and off for six months 
initial production of mmcf and barrels of lco per day was reached in mid november 
the capability of the wilga well to continually produce these volumes of gas is constrained to some extent by our ability to sell all of the lco produced  as we have a fixed amount of lco storage on site 
at the commencement of production  we had a single purchaser contracted to take all of the lco produced 
due to unforeseen circumstances  the purchaser was unable to fulfill its commitment to take all of our lco production 
accordingly  shortly after reaching our targeted initial production levels  we were required to reduce production from the well to a single zone  pending obtaining additional lco purchasers 
since that time  we have begun selling our lco to several different purchasers 
production levels in early have varied between and mmcf and and barrels of lco per day 
we are negotiating with several lco purchasers to take higher lco quantities and expect the lco marketing situation to be resolved in the first half of  allowing the well to return to its targeted initial production levels 
as with the zaniemysl well above  the wilga well is likely to significantly alter our production  revenues and expenses for and beyond 
we contracted for wilga gas sales nearly a year ago at a price based on consumer gas prices in poland 
effective january   the tariff used as our basis at wilga was increased  and we are currently selling gas at approximately per mcf at current exchange rates 
all gas is sold to a subsidiary of pogc 
our lco is priced at a slight discount to brent  which varies from to depending on the purchaser 
assuming current prices remain in effect  and assuming daily production of mmcf and barrels of lco is reached by the end of the first quarter of  we should realize gross revenues of approximately million from our share of the well in these figures will vary depending on our ability to market of our lco production 
as with our zaniemysl well  we plan to conduct a detailed reservoir test after six months of production that will allow us to measure reserves with greater accuracy and help us to decide whether to drill an offset well 
at december   the wilga well had approximately bcf of gross proved gas reserves and  barrels of lco bcf and  barrels  net to our interest  but based upon d seismic data and study to date  we believe that the reservoir contains significant additional reserves that may be captured through additional drilling on the structure 
establishment of million senior credit facility in november of  we entered into a million senior facility agreement the facility with the royal bank of scotland plc rbs 
we believe our arrangement with rbs is the first onshore gas project financing in poland 
the facility is provided to fx energy poland sp 
z oo  a wholly owned subsidiary of fx energy  inc funds from the facility  which became available to us in march   will cover infrastructure and development costs at a variety of our polish gas projects 
the facility is collateralized by our commercial wells and production in poland 
the facility is significant to us on a number of levels 
first  and foremost  we view the facility as a validation by a respected international financial institution of the value of our reserves  production and land in poland 
second  it provides us with the ability to leverage our balance sheet and finance the development of our gas projects in poland at a reasonable cost 
third  it provides us with a potentially important initial relationship in the financial community 
under the terms of the facility  the initial commitment is for approximately million  which is based solely on the proved reserve values of our wilga  zaniemysl and kleka wells 
once we achieve certain amounts of net cumulative production from these wells  the ongoing commitment amount will be based on proved and probable reserves  which should cause the commitment amount to increase to close to the entire face amount of the facility 
the terms of the facility call for interest payments only through the end of the principal amount of the facility will begin to be reduced at that time  terminating at the end of  unless we have been successful in adding additional properties and or reserves to our borrowing base 
interest will be accrued at libor plus an applicable margin  which is currently  but which will be reduced to upon the attainment of the above discussed cumulative production thresholds 
we expect to satisfy those production requirements sometime during the second quarter of in consideration for the facility  we paid a origination fee and issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  valid for two years at an exercise price of per share 
the black scholes value of these warrants approximately  along with the loan origination fee and associated legal fees  have been capitalized as deferred financing costs  and will be amortized over the six year term of the loan  beginning in an annual unused commitment fee of will be charged quarterly based on the average daily unused portion of the facility 
polish gas prices and the value of polish gas reserves poland has historically subsidized the cost of gas it imports from russia and other countries for its consumers 
however  subsequent to joining the european union  and in an effort to create a more transparent gas market  poland has recently begun raising consumer prices in country  and appears likely to do so over the next few years 
we are a direct beneficiary of these price increases 
as discussed above  gas production from all of our currently producing polish wells is sold to pogc  or one of its affiliates  subject to gas sales agreements that are in effect for the entire life of the fields 
in the cases of wilga and zaniemysl  the agreements provide for price change mechanisms that are tied to polish consumer gas prices 
increases in consumer prices in poland would have several effects 
first  and most important  higher prices mean increased revenues and cash flows 
second  the price increases at our properties would increase the value of our reserves 
third  an increase in the value in our reserves would increase our borrowing capacity for project financing purposes 
it should be noted that a decrease in polish consumer prices in the future would have the opposite and negative effects 
nevertheless  the following table illustrates the effect that recent price increases had on the pre tax pv value of our polish gas reserves from to excluding the kleka well net proved reserves bcfe pre tax pv value mm net proved reserves bcfe pre tax pv value mm change in pv mm change in pv well wilga zaniemysl sroda total rusocin property impairment during the second half of  we and pogc drilled the rusocin well  the first well intentionally focused on a stratigraphic trap in the rotliegend 
in a january initial drill stem test  the well flowed gas from an meter section of the rotliegend sandstone target reservoir 
results of the initial drill stem test indicated that the reservoir may extend beyond the mapped faults  suggesting a larger reservoir along the wolsztyn high 
we believe the well may have discovered the lower edge of a pinch out at the top of the rotliegend sandstone with porosity  and that the well contains commercial quantities of natural gas 
following the rusocin discovery  however  our exploration and production efforts have been focused in other areas and play types  primarily in the sroda area  and it is likely that this focus will continue in the near term 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined to delay steps to place the rusocin well into production as we focus on the sroda area in our future plans may include further exploration and development along the pinch out trend 
in accordance with the provisions of fasb staff position  accounting for suspended well costs  the capitalized costs associated with this well of million were charged to expense in the fourth quarter of critical accounting policies oil and gas activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that net capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not considered to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net cash flows determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
gains and losses are recognized on sales of entire interests in proved and unproved properties 
sales of partial interests are generally treated as a recovery of costs and any resulting gain or loss is recorded as other income 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
as of december   we had million of capitalized exploratory well costs pending the determination of proved reserves 
further information can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
oil and gas reserves engineering estimates of our oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
there are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as proved 
proved reserve estimates are updated at least annually and take into account recent production and technical information about each field 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
this change is considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis in related depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rates 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  these estimates are used in determining dd a expense and impairment expense and in disclosing the supplemental standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas properties 
dd a rates are determined based on estimated proved reserve quantities the denominator and capitalized costs of producing properties the numerator 
producing properties capitalized costs are amortized based on the units of oil or gas produced 
therefore  assuming all other variables are held constant  an increase in estimated proved reserves decreases our dd a expense 
also  estimated reserves are used to calculate future cash flows from our oil and gas operations  which serve as an indicator of fair value in determining whether a property is impaired or not 
the larger the estimated reserves  the less likely the property is impaired 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no

further information concerning our business segments can be found in note  business segments  in the consolidated financial statements 
exploration and production segment gas revenues 
as discussed previously  we began gas production in poland during  and we expect the related gas revenues to rapidly become the primary component of our revenue 
revenues from gas sales were million during  compared to in both and gas revenue and production information for each of our three producing wells during was as follows volumes mcf revenue price per mcf wilga zaniemysl kleka note gas prices vary from property to property based primarily on the energy content of the gas  as well the year in which the gas sales contract was consummated 
our wilga well  located just southeast of warsaw  commenced production on september  this well has three separate productive zones  is capable of producing from two zones simultaneously  and produces both gas and light crude oil lco 
estimated peak production with two zones producing simultaneously is approximately mmcf and bbls of lco per day 
during the fourth quarter of  we did produce from two zones for a short period of time  however  our lco purchaser was unable to take all of the contracted lco quantities produced  which caused us to reduce production back to a single zone until we can find a suitable replacement purchaser or purchasers 
we expect to remedy this situation during the first quarter of  and resume our estimated initial production rates 
gas production began at our zaniemysl well  located in western poland  on october  initial production of mmcfd was reached on november   and has remained essentially constant since that time 
production from our kleka well remains fairly constant from month to month  averaging approximately mmcfd 
we did not record any gas revenues during and from the kleka well 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction fences i commitment and settlement  related to settling our fences i obligation with pogc 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in revenues were approximately  related to the sale of a total of  barrels of lco in poland during all other oil revenues during the three years were derived from our producing properties in the united states 
during these three years  oil revenues fluctuated primarily due to volatile oil prices and changing production rates that are a function of normal property declines 
us oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately  due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately  related to production declines 
oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately  due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately  related to lower oil production 
a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil revenues  average oil prices  oil production volumes  and lifting costs per barrel for the years ended december   and  is set forth in the following table for the year ended december  revenues percent change versus prior year average price per bbl percent change versus prior year production volumes per bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced 
lco lifting costs in poland are based on an allocation of total costs based on relative revenues between oil and gas 
lifting costs do not include production taxes 
lease operating costs 
lease operating costs were million in  million in and million in operating costs rose slightly from to as we commenced gas and lco production at our wilga well in poland 
lease operating costs at our kleka and zaniemysl wells were not significant in we also continued recompleting wells in montana  adding nine producing wells 
operating costs rose from to as we took advantage of higher oil prices and revenues to work over and recomplete several wells in montana  which increased our operating costs by approximately  in addition  the higher oil revenues in resulted in higher value based production taxes of approximately  exploration costs 
our exploration efforts are focused in poland  and the expenses consist of oil and gas leasehold impairments 
exploration costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
geological and geophysical costs  or g g costs  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during all three years  most of our g g costs were spent on acquiring  processing and interpreting new seismic data on the fences i and ii areas  including our new d seismic survey in the sroda area which began shooting in late exploratory dry hole costs were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our exploration costs include approximately  associated with the drozdowice well in our fences iii prospect in poland  along with additional amounts for two dry holes in montana and nevada 
during  we plugged and abandoned two wells in poland  the sroda and lugi wells  for a total cost of approximately million 
in addition  we plugged and abandoned four exploratory wells in nevada for a total cost of approximately  as part of the abandonment of our pomeranian project area  we were required to plug and abandon the tuchola well in impairment costs 
impairments of oil and gas properties were million  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as discussed previously  during we impaired the entire amount of capitalized costs associated with our rusocin well 
there were no similar impairments during or dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to was due primarily to the commencement of production at our properties in poland  which accounted for  of the  increase 
the remaining increase is due to capital cost additions in at our montana producing properties 
the increase from to was due primarily to a reduction in oil reserves associated with higher operating costs  offset by lower production volumes 
oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
activity in the contract drilling industry where we operate picked up significantly during  increased again in  and slowed somewhat in oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
we cannot accurately predict future oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services costs 
oilfield services costs were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
in general  oilfield servicing costs are directly associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield services costs will continue to fluctuate period to period based on the number of wells drilled  revenues generated  weather  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our company owned properties  and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we spent   and  on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during  and  respectively 
nonsegmented items g a costs corporate 
g a costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we made significant reductions in legal and consulting fees  reducing our g a by approximately  decreases in other g a areas were offset to some extent by higher employee costs  as we increased headcount in our poland office 
during  we opened a new office in warsaw  poland  hiring five experienced individuals to assist in our exploration and production efforts 
a portion of the g a increase in was attributable to these new office costs  including salaries  taxes and benefits 
in addition  we added administrative staff in the united states  where we also experienced higher compensation related costs 
stock compensation g a 
stock compensation expense recorded in represents the amortization of stock and options issued to consultants prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
in  two of our officers exercised options to acquire a total of approximately  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  by canceling options to purchase approximately  shares and applying the option equity to pay the exercise price on the options exercised 
the year options were due to expire during the second quarter 
in connection with this cashless exercise  we recorded a stock compensation charge of approximately million  which is equal to the difference between the exercise price and fair value of the options on the date of exercise  and a corresponding increase in additional paid in capital 
this noncash transaction had no impact on our working capital  cash flows or stockholders equity 
amortization of deferred compensation g a 
as discussed above  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r on january   using the modified prospective method 
under this method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
stock based awards that are granted prior to the effective date continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 except that stock option expense for unvested options must be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in november and december and million of amortization of unvested stock options granted prior to  using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
interest and other income corporate 
interest and other income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
increases in both yearly periods are due to higher cash balances generally available for investment  coupled with rising interest rates over the two year period 
income taxes 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  issuance of debt securities  and agreements with industry participants that funded our share of costs in certain exploratory activities in return for an interest in our properties 
we believe our cash resources and marketable securities at december   together with anticipated revenues in and availability under our million senior facility agreement  are sufficient to cover our planned exploration program and ongoing operations in the united states and poland for the next months 
we may seek to obtain additional funds for future capital investments from the sale of additional securities  project financing to help finance the completion of successful wells  sale of partial property interests  or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
we will allocate our existing capital as well as funds we may obtain in the future among our various projects at our discretion 
we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon future events 
for example  we may change the allocation of our expenditures based on the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
working capital current assets less current liabilities 
our working capital was million as of december   a decrease of million from december  the decrease is due primarily to costs associated with our drilling and seismic activities during  coupled with the costs of production facilities at our wilga and zaniemysl wells 
operating activities 
we used net cash of million  million and million in our operating activities during  and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net losses  excluding noncash charges  incurred in those years 
our current assets at year end included approximately million in accrued oil and gas sales from both the united states and poland  and  in refundable input vat that we expect to receive during the first six months of our current liabilities at year end included approximately million in costs related to our exploration activities in poland that were paid in early investing activities 
we received net cash from investing activities of million and million in and  respectively  and used net cash of million in investing activities in in we received million from the maturities of marketable securities 
we invested  in marketable securities 
we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and  adding to our oilfield services equipment 
in we received million from the sale of marketable securities and million from the recovery of previously capitalized input vat 
we invested  in marketable securities 
we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and  upgrading our oilfield services equipment 
in we transferred million to our investment portfolio of marketable securities 
we also spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and purchasing new oilfield technical software 
financing activities 
we used net cash in financing activities of  in  and received net cash of million and million from our financing activities during and  respectively 
all the cash used in financing activities in was used to pay the loan origination fees and associated legal costs related to our million senior credit facility 
all of the proceeds in were from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
in we received a total of million in net proceeds from the sale of securities 
in addition  the exercise of warrants and options provided additional proceeds of million 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we had no significant contractual obligations or commitments as of december  our oil and gas drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry that can cause severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations  personal injury and loss of life 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our united states and poland operations and also rely on the insurance or financial capabilities of our exploration partners in poland 
these measures do not cover risks related to violations of environmental laws or all other risks involved in oil and gas exploration  drilling and production 
we would be adversely affected by a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance or by our inability to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation number  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we do not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will have an affect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab was issued to provide interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the provisions of sab are effective for the company for the december  year end 
the provisions of sab had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on our current or future earnings or operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk price risk realized pricing for our oil production in the united states is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price of oil  subject to gravity and other adjustments for the actual oil sold 
historically  oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility relating to our oil production in the united states is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
our gas in poland is sold to pogc or its subsidiaries under contracts that extend for the life of each field 
prices are determined contractually and  in the case of our wilga and zaniemysl wells  are tied to published tariffs 
gas sold at kleka is sold at a fixed price without regard to any published tariff or index 
the currently limited volumes and sources of our gas production mean we cannot assure uninterruptible production or production in amounts that would be meaningful to industrial users  which may depress the price we may be able to obtain by limiting our market for potential customers 
pogc is the primary purchaser of domestic gas in poland 
we expect that the prices we receive in the short term for gas we produce will be lower than would be the case in a more competitive setting and may be lower than prevailing western european prices  at least until a fully competitive market develops in poland 
we currently do not engage in any hedging activities to protect ourselves against market risks associated with oil and gas price fluctuations  although we may elect to do so if we achieve a significant amount of production in poland 
foreign currency risk we have entered into various agreements in poland denominated in the polish zloty 
the polish zloty is subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond our control 
we do not currently engage in hedging transactions to protect ourselves against foreign currency risks  nor do we intend to do so in the immediate future  our policy is to use zloty based revenues generated in poland to pay for all zloty based invoices  supplemented as needed by transferring us dollars to poland to cover invoices that exceed the generated revenues
