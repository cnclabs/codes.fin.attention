item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a review of revenue  net income  and total assets for the last three years 
our strategy rising healthcare costs and health insurance premiums are causing employers  as well as federal and state government programs  to shift more of the cost of healthcare benefits to consumers in the form of higher premium contributions  deductibles  co insurance and co payments 
since  average premiums for family coverage in the united states increased  while wages grew only 
typical family out of pocket healthcare costs now exceed of the average annual wage 
as a result of increased personal spending on healthcare  healthcare consumers ie  employees and their family members  individuals  and retirees are demanding better service  efficiency  and value from their health plan 
this includes improved information regarding health care benefit and insurance coverage options  better information to determine the most efficient methods to fund out of pocket costs  real time information regarding benefits eligibility and accessibility  accurate information at the point of service regarding out of pocket costs ie  patient or consumer financial responsibility  real time information regarding healthcare fund balances and claims payment status  and increased comparative data and intelligence regarding healthcare provider cost ie  pricing and quality

competition the market for healthcare information technology services is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving  highly fragmented and subject to rapid technological change 
by using proprietary technologies and methods  we develop  integrate and deliver packaged enterprise and component software applications  connectivity solutions for both internet and direct communication  application hosting  infrastructure outsourced business services and it consulting services 
our competitors provide some or all of the services that we provide 
our competitors can be categorized as follows information technology and outsourcing companies  such as perot systems corporation  ibm  affiliated computer services  dst who acquired the healthcare division of computer sciences corporation  electronic data systems corporation and infocrossing  healthcare information software vendors  including the newly combined dst amisys synertech inc  perot systems corporation  electronic data systems corporation  and plexis in the health plan market  as well as eldorado and sbpa in the benefits administration market  and mmc  gorman and dynamics in the medicare advantage market  healthcare information technology consulting firms  such as first consulting group  inc  proxicom acs and the consulting divisions or former affiliates of the major accounting firms  such as deloitte consulting and accenture  healthcare e commerce and portal companies  such as emdeon corporation formerly webmd corporation  healthnation  healthtrio  avolent  edocs and benefitfocus  enterprise application integration vendors such as vitria  seebeyond  tibco  fuego and m  care management software and service companies such as healthtrio  medecision  mckesson  emdeon  healthatoz and clickcare  consumer retail software and services companies such as caregain and fiserv  and health plans  themselves  some of whom are providing hosting and bpo services to the marketplace and leveraging capabilities across the aggregated membership of multiple organizations

in addition  some of our third party software vendors compete with us from time to time by offering their software on a licensed or hosted basis 
we believe companies in our industry primarily compete based on performance  price  software functionality  ease of implementation  level of service  and track record of successful customer installations 
although our competitive position is difficult to characterize due principally to the variety of current and potential competitors and the evolving nature of our market  we believe that we presently compete favorably with respect to all of these factors 
while our competition comes from many industry segments  we believe no other single company offers the integrated  single source solution that we provide to our customers 
to be competitive  we must continue to enhance our products and services  as well as our sales  marketing  and distribution channels to respond promptly and effectively to changes in the healthcare industry  including consolidation  constantly evolving standards and government regulation affecting healthcare transactions  the challenges of technological innovation and adoption  evolving business practices of our customers  our competitors new products and services  new products and services developed by our vendor partners and suppliers  and

our consulting services group develops and utilizes information technology life cycle methodology and related paper based and software based toolsets to perform customer assessments  planning  design  development  implementation  and support services 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services 
unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products  services or proprietary information 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be time consuming and costly 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as we expand our product and service offerings and the number of competitors increases 
defending against these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and be forced to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease using the applications that contain the infringing technology or content 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or content or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we also rely on a variety of technologies that are licensed from third parties to perform key functions 
these third party licenses are an essential element of our hosted solutions business 
these third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms in the future 
the loss of or inability to maintain any of these licenses could delay the introduction of software enhancements and other features until equivalent technology can be licensed or developed 
any such delay could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
significant customers as of december  we were providing services to unique customers 
one of our customers  the regence group  accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue in no single customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable in in  one of our customers  the regence group  accounted for more than of our accounts receivable and two of our customers  the regence group and united healthcare services  inc  each accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue 
no single customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable and consolidated revenues in employees as of december   we had approximately  employees 
our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements  and we generally have good relations with our employees

item a risk factors we cannot predict if we will be able to sustain our positive net income 
we may not be able to sustain our current level of revenue or increase our revenue in the future 
we currently derive our revenue primarily from providing hosted solutions  software licensing and maintenance  and other services such as consulting 
we depend on the continued demand for healthcare information technology and related services 
we plan to continue investing in administrative infrastructure  research and development  sales and marketing  and acquisitions 
if we are not able to sustain our current levels of revenue or maintain our profitability  our operations may be adversely affected 
revenue from a limited number of customers comprises a significant portion of our total revenue  and if these customers terminate or modify existing contracts or experience business difficulties  it could adversely affect our earnings 
as of december   we were providing services to unique customers 
one of our customers  the regence group  represented approximately of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  although we typically enter into multi year customer agreements  a majority of our customers are able to reduce or cancel their use of our services before the end of the contract term  subject to monetary penalties which are not significant 
we also provide services to some hosted customers without long term contracts 
in addition  many of our contracts are structured so that we generate revenue based on units of volume  which include the number of members  number of workstations or number of users 
if our customers experience business difficulties and the units of volume decline or if a customer ceases operations for any reason  we will generate less revenue under these contracts and our operating results may be materially and adversely impacted 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed and cannot be reduced on short notice to compensate for unanticipated contract cancellations or reductions 
as a result  any termination  significant reduction or modification of our business relationships with any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
our business is changing rapidly  which could cause our quarterly operating results to vary and our stock price to fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past  and we expect that they will continue to vary in future periods 
our quarterly operating results can vary significantly based on a number of factors  such as our mix of products and services revenue  our ability to add new customers and renew existing accounts  selling additional products and services to existing customers  long and unpredictable sales cycles  meeting project milestones and customer expectations  seasonality in information technology purchases  the timing of new customer sales  and general economic conditions 
variations in our quarterly operating results could cause us to not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or the expectations of our investors  which could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner that may be unrelated to our long term operating performance 
we base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue  and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we do not achieve our expected revenue targets  we may not be able to reduce our short term spending in response 
any shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations 
the intensifying competition we face from both established entities and new entries in the market may adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
the market for our technology and services is highly competitive and rapidly changing and requires potentially expensive technological advances 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources  and greater market recognition than we have 
many of our competitors also have  or 
table of contents may develop or acquire  substantial installed customer bases in the healthcare industry 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their applications or services than we can devote 
our competitors can be categorized as follows information technology and outsourcing companies  such as perot systems corporation  ibm  affiliated computer services  dst who acquired the healthcare division of computer sciences corporation  electronic data systems corporation and infocrossing  healthcare information software vendors  including the newly combined dst amisys synertech inc  perot systems corporation and electronic data systems corporation and plexis in the health plan market  as well as eldorado and sbpa in the benefits administration market and mmc  gorman and dynamics in the medicare advantage market  healthcare information technology consulting firms  such as first consulting group  inc  proxicom acs and the consulting divisions or former affiliates of the major accounting firms  such as deloitte consulting and accenture  healthcare e commerce and portal companies  such as emdeon corporation formerly webmd corporation  healthtrio  avolent  edocs and benefitfocus  enterprise application integration vendors such as vitria  seebeyond  tibco  fuego and m  care management software and service companies such as healthtrio  medecision  mckesson  emdeon  healthatoz and clickcare  consumer retail software and services companies such as  caregain and fiserv  and health plans  themselves  some of whom are providing hosting and bpo services to the marketplace and leveraging capabilities across the aggregated membership of multiple organizations 
further  other entities that do not presently compete with us may do so in the future  including major software information systems companies and financial services entities 
we believe our ability to compete will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our current technology and services  respond effectively to technological changes  introduce new capabilities for current and new market segments  and meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
maintain and continue to develop partnerships with vendors  increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins  and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  pricing  margins  and market share could be negatively impacted further as a greater number of available products in the marketplace increases the likelihood that product and service offerings in our markets become more fungible and price sensitive 
our sales and implementation cycles are long and unpredictable 
we have experienced and continue to experience long and unpredictable sales cycles  particularly for contracts with large customers  or customers purchasing multiple products and services 
enterprise software typically requires significant capital expenditures by customers  and the decision to outsource it related services is complicated and time consuming 
major purchases by large payer organizations typically range from nine to months or more from initial contact to contract execution 
the prospects currently in our pipeline may not sign contracts within a reasonable period of time or at all 
in addition  our implementation cycle has ranged from to months or longer from contract execution to completion of implementation 
during the sales cycle and the implementation cycle  we will expend substantial time  effort  and financial resources preparing contract proposals  negotiating the contract  and implementing the solution 
we may not realize any revenue to offset these expenditures  and  if we do  accounting principles may not allow us to recognize the revenue during corresponding periods  which could harm our future operating results 
additionally  any decision by our customers to delay implementation may adversely affect our revenues 
consolidation of healthcare payer organizations and benefits administrators could decrease the number of our existing and potential customers 
there has been and continues to be acquisition and consolidation activity among healthcare payers and benefits administrators 
mergers or consolidations of payer organizations in the future could decrease the number of our existing and potential customers 
the acquisition of a customer could reduce our revenue and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
table of contents and financial condition 
a smaller overall market for our products and services could also result in lower revenue and margins 
in addition  healthcare payer organizations are increasing their focus on consumer directed healthcare  in which consumers interact directly with health plans through administrative services provided by health plans to employer groups 
these services compete with the services provided by benefits administrators and could result in additional consolidation in the benefits administration market 
some of our significant customers may develop their own software solutions  which could decrease the demand for our products 
some of our customers in the healthcare payer industry have  or may seek to acquire  the financial and technological resources necessary to develop software solutions to perform the functions currently serviced by our products and services 
additionally  consolidation in the healthcare payer industry could result in additional organizations having the resources necessary to develop similar software solutions 
if these organizations successfully develop and utilize their own software solutions  they may discontinue their use of our products or services  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend on our software application vendor relationships  and if our software application vendors terminate or modify existing contracts or experience business difficulties  or if we are unable to establish new relationships with additional software application vendors  it could harm our business 
we depend  and will continue to depend  on our licensing and business relationships with third party software application vendors 
our success depends significantly on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with our vendors and to build new relationships with other vendors in order to enhance our services and application offerings and remain competitive 
although most of our licensing agreements are perpetual or automatically renewable  they are subject to termination in the event that we materially breach such agreements 
we may not be able to maintain relationships with our vendors or establish relationships with new vendors 
the software  products or services of our third party vendors may not achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success 
accordingly  our existing relationships may not result in sustained business partnerships  successful product or service offerings or the generation of significant revenue for us 
our arrangements with third party software application vendors are not exclusive 
these third party vendors may not regard our relationships with them as important to their own respective businesses and operations 
they may reassess their commitment to us at any time and may choose to develop or enhance their own competing distribution channels and product support services 
if we do not maintain our existing relationships or if the economic terms of our business relationships change  we may not be able to license and offer these services and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay service development or timely introduction of new services and divert our resources 
any such delays could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
our licenses for the use of third party software applications are essential to the technology solutions we provide for our customers 
loss of any one of our major vendor agreements may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
we rely on third party software vendors for components of our software products 
our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors  and we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products 
we may not be able to replace the functions provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective  or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm the sale of our products unless and until we can secure or develop an alternative source 
although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology currently licensed to us  such alternate sources may not be available to us in a timely manner  may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use 
we have sustained rapid growth  and our inability to manage this growth could harm our business 
we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations since inception and may continue to do so in the future 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational  and financial resources  and information systems 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
our acquisition strategy may disrupt our business and require additional financing 
since our initial public offering in october  we have made ten acquisitions 
a significant portion of our historical growth has occurred through acquisitions and we may continue to seek strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we compete with other companies to acquire businesses  making it difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms or at all 

table of contents acquisitions may require significant capital  typically entail many risks  and can result in difficulties integrating operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired businesses 
we may be unable to successfully integrate companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future in a timely manner 
if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses  we may incur substantial costs and delays or other operational  technical or financial problems 
in addition  the integration of our acquisitions may divert our management s attention from our existing business  which could damage our relationships with our key customers and employees 
to finance future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities that could be dilutive to our stockholders 
we may also incur debt and additional amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions 
the interest expense related to this debt and additional amortization expense may significantly reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
acquisitions may also result in large one time charges as well as goodwill and intangible assets and impairment charges in the future that could negatively impact our operating results 
our need for additional financing is uncertain as is our ability to raise capital if required 
if we are not able to sustain our positive net income  we may need additional financing to fund operations or growth 
we may not be able to raise additional funds through public or private financings at any particular point in the future or on favorable terms 
future financings could adversely affect our common stock and debt securities 
our business will suffer if our software products contain errors 
the proprietary and third party software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite our testing and quality control procedures  errors may be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products 
significant technical challenges may also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy those products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our costs would increase 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share  loss of customers  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  and increased insurance costs 
we could lose customers and revenue if we fail to meet contractual obligations including performance standards and other material obligations 
many of our service agreements contain performance standards and other post contract obligations 
our failure to meet these standards or breach other material obligations under our agreements could trigger remedies for our customers including termination  financial penalties and refunds that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
if our ability to expand our network and computing infrastructure is constrained in any way  we could lose customers and damage our operating results 
we must continue to expand and adapt our network and technology infrastructure to accommodate additional users  increased transaction volumes  changing customer requirements and technological obsolescence 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our hosted solutions or be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases 
we may be unable to expand or adapt our network infrastructure to meet additional demand or our customers changing needs on a timely basis  at a commercially reasonable cost or at all 
our current information systems  procedures and controls may not continue to support our operations while maintaining acceptable overall performance and may hinder our ability to exploit the market for healthcare applications and services 
service lapses could cause our users to switch to the services of our competitors  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 

table of contents performance or security problems with our systems could damage our business 
our customers satisfaction and our business could be harmed if we  or our customers  experience any system delays  failures  or loss of data 
although we devote substantial resources to avoid performance problems  errors may occur 
errors in the processing of customer data may result in loss of data  inaccurate information  and delays 
such errors could cause us to lose customers and be liable for damages 
we currently process a substantial number of our customers transactions and data at our data centers in colorado 
although we have safeguards for emergencies and we have contracted backup processing for our customers critical functions  the occurrence of a major catastrophic event or other system failure at any of our facilities could interrupt data processing or result in the loss of stored data 
in addition  we depend on the efficient operation of telecommunication providers that have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages 
a material security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability to us 
we retain confidential customer and federally protected patient information in our data centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties  or similar disruptive problems 
our services agreements generally contain limitations on liability  and we maintain insurance with adequate coverage limits for general liability and professional liability to protect against claims associated with the use of our products and services 
however  the contractual provisions and insurance coverage may not provide adequate coverage against all possible claims that may be asserted 
in addition  appropriate insurance may be unavailable in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
a successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
even unsuccessful claims could result in litigation or arbitration costs and may divert management s attention from our existing business 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate management and other key personnel 
our success will depend in large part on the continued services of management and key personnel 
competition for personnel in the healthcare information technology market is intense  and there are a limited number of persons with knowledge of  and experience in  this industry 
we do not have employment agreements with most of our executive officers  so any of these individuals may terminate his or her employment with us at any time 
the loss of services from one or more of our management or key personnel  or the inability to hire additional management or key personnel as needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
although we currently experience relatively low rates of turnover for our management and key personnel  the rate of turnover may increase in the future 
in addition  we expect to further grow our operations and our needs for additional management and key personnel will increase 
our continued ability to compete effectively in our business depends on our ability to attract  retain  and motivate these individuals 
we rely on an adequate supply and performance of computer hardware and related equipment from third parties to provide services to larger customers and any significant interruption in the availability or performance of third party hardware and related equipment could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products to certain customers on a timely basis 
as we offer our hosted solution services and software to a greater number of customers and particularly to larger customers  we may be required to obtain specialized computer equipment from third parties that can be difficult to obtain on short notice 
any delay in obtaining such equipment may prevent us from delivering large systems to our customers on a timely basis 
we also may rely on such equipment to meet required performance standards 
we may have no control over the resources that third parties may devote to service our customers or satisfy performance standards 
if such performance standards are not met  we may be adversely impacted under our service agreements with our customers 
any failure or inability to protect our technology and confidential information could adversely affect our business 
our success depends in part upon proprietary software and other confidential information 
the software and information technology industries have experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of software products and other proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
however  these protections may not be sufficient  and they do not prevent independent third party development of competitive products or services 
we execute confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with certain employees and our suppliers  as well as limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
the departure of any of our management and technical personnel  the breach of their confidentiality and non disclosure obligations to us  or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have had  and may continue to have  employees leave us and go to work for competitors 
if we are not successful in prohibiting the unauthorized use of our proprietary 
table of contents technology or the use of our processes by a competitor  our competitive advantage may be significantly reduced which would result in reduced revenues 
our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 
we cannot be certain that our products do not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states and many other countries are not publicly disclosed until a patent is issued  applications covering technology used in our software products may have been filed without our knowledge 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time  including claims of alleged infringement of the patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our products 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert our management s attention away from running our business and seriously harm our business 
if we were to discover that our products violated the intellectual property rights of others  we would have to obtain licenses from these parties in order to continue marketing our products without substantial reengineering 
we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all  and if we could not obtain such licenses  we might not be able to reengineer our products successfully or in a timely fashion 
if we fail to address any infringement issues successfully  we would be forced to incur significant costs  including damages and potentially satisfying indemnification obligations that we have with our customers  and we could be prevented from selling certain of our products 
if our consulting services revenue does not grow substantially  our revenue growth could be adversely impacted 
our consulting services revenue represents a significant component of our total revenue and we anticipate that it will continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue in the future 
the level of consulting services revenue depends upon the healthcare industry s demand for outsourced information technology services and our ability to deliver products that generate implementation and follow on consulting services revenue 
our ability to increase services revenue will depend in part on our ability to increase the capacity of our consulting group  including our ability to recruit  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel 
the insolvency of our customers or the inability of our customers to pay for our services could negatively affect our financial condition 
healthcare payers are often required to maintain restricted cash reserves and satisfy strict balance sheet ratios promulgated by state regulatory agencies 
in addition  healthcare payers are subject to risks that physician groups or associations within their organizations become subject to costly litigation or become insolvent  which may adversely affect the financial stability of the payer 
if healthcare payers are unable to pay for our services because of their need to maintain cash reserves or failure to maintain balance sheet ratios or solvency  our ability to collect fees for services rendered would be impaired and our financial condition could be adversely affected 
changes in government regulation of the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of government regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures 
in addition  proposals to substantially reform medicare  medicaid  and the healthcare system in general have been or are being considered by congress 
these proposals  if enacted  may further increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates  and otherwise adversely affect the healthcare industry which could adversely impact our business 
the impact of regulatory developments in the healthcare industry is complex and difficult to predict  and our business could be adversely affected by existing or new healthcare regulatory requirements or interpretations 
participants in the healthcare industry  such as our payer customers  are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations  including laws and regulations relating to the confidential treatment and secure transmission of patient medical records  and other healthcare information 
legislators at both the state and federal levels have proposed and enacted additional legislation relating to the use and disclosure of medical information  and the federal government is likely to enact new federal laws or regulations in the near future 
pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  the department of health and human services dhhs has issued a series of regulations setting forth security  privacy and transactions standards for all health plans  clearinghouses  and healthcare providers to follow with respect to individually identifiable health information 
dhhs has issued final regulations mandating the use of standard transactions and code sets  which became effective october  dhhs has also issued final hipaa privacy regulations  which required covered entities to be in compliance by april   and final hipaa security regulations  which required covered entities to be in compliance by april  many of our customers will also be subject to state laws implementing the federal gramm leach bliley act  relating to certain disclosures of nonpublic personal health information and nonpublic personal financial information by insurers and health plans 
our payer customers must comply with hipaa  its regulations  and other applicable healthcare laws and regulations 
in addition  we may be deemed to be a covered entity subject to hipaa because we offer our customers products that convert data to a 
table of contents hipaa compliant format 
accordingly  we must comply with certain provisions of hipaa and in order for our products and services to be marketable  they must contain features and functions that allow our customers to comply with hipaa and other healthcare laws and regulations 
we believe our products currently allow our customers to comply with existing laws and regulations 
however  because hipaa and its regulations have yet to be fully interpreted  our products may require modification in the future 
if we fail to offer solutions that permit our customers to comply with applicable laws and regulations  our business will suffer 
we perform billing and claims services that are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws 
the federal government in recent years has imposed heightened scrutiny on billing and collection practices of healthcare providers and related entities  particularly with respect to potentially fraudulent billing practices  such as submissions of inflated claims for payment and upcoding 
violations of the laws regarding billing and coding may lead to civil monetary penalties  criminal fines  imprisonment  or exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federally funded healthcare programs for our customers and for us 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
in addition  laws governing healthcare payers are often not uniform among states 
this could require us to undertake the expense and difficulty of tailoring our products in order for our customers to be in compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations 
part of our business is subject to government regulation relating to the internet that could impair our operations 
the internet and its associated technologies are subject to increasing government regulation 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal  state  local  and foreign governments  and agencies 
laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet relating to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  on line content regulation  user privacy  taxation and quality of products and services 
many existing laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate the methods of the internet based hosted  software and information technology solutions we offer 
we believe  however  that these laws may be applied to us 
we expect our products and services to be in substantial compliance with all material federal  state and local laws and regulations governing our operations 
however  new legal requirements or interpretations applicable to the internet could decrease the growth in the use of the internet  limit the use of the internet for our products and services or prohibit the sale of a particular product or service  increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial conditions 
to the extent that we market our products and services outside the united states  the international regulatory environment relating to the internet and healthcare services could also have an adverse effect on our business 
increased leverage as a result of our convertible note offering may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
on october   we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due notes 
the indebtedness under the notes constitutes senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness 
the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated october  the indenture with wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee 
as of december   our total consolidated long term debt was million 
in addition  the indenture does not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  and we may choose to incur additional debt in the future 
our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you  because it could affect our ability to satisfy our debt obligations under the notes or our credit facility  a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments of our debt obligations and may not be available for operations  expansion  acquisitions or other purposes  it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business  our industry or the economy in general 
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance  which will be subject to our success in marketing our products and services  general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness  we may be required  among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  to sell assets  and or to reduce or delay planned expenditures on research and development and or commercialization activities 

table of contents such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all 
we have certain repurchase and payment obligations under the notes and we may not be able to repurchase such notes or pay the amounts due upon conversion of the notes when necessary 
on each of october   and  holders of certain of the notes may require us to purchase  for cash  all or a portion of their notes at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
if a fundamental change occurs  as defined in the indenture  including a change in control transaction  holders of such notes may also require us to repurchase  for cash  all or a portion of their notes 
in addition  upon conversion of such notes if we have made an irrevocable election to settle conversion in cash  we would be required to satisfy our conversion obligation up to the principal amount of the notes in cash 
our ability to repurchase the notes and settle the conversion of the notes in cash is effectively subordinated to our senior credit facility and may be limited by law  by the indenture  by the terms of other agreements relating to our senior debt and by indebtedness and agreements that we may enter into in the future which may replace  supplement or amend our existing or future debt 
our failure to repurchase the notes or make the required payments upon conversion would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which would in turn constitute a default under the terms of our senior credit facility and other indebtedness at that time 
our common stock price has been  and may continue to be  volatile and our shareholders may not be able to resell shares of our stock at or above the price paid for such shares 
the price for shares of our common stock has exhibited high levels of volatility with significant volume and price fluctuations  which makes our common stock unsuitable for many investors 
for example  for the year ended december   the closing price of our common stock ranged from a high of to a low of 
the fluctuations in price of our common stock have occasionally been related to our operating performance 
these broad fluctuations may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock 
the price of our common stock has also been influenced by fluctuations in our results of operations or the operations of our competitors or customers  failure of our results of operations to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us  our competitors or our customers  and the timing and announcements of new products or financial results by us or our competitors 
future issuances of common stock may depress the trading price of our common stock 
any future issuance of equity securities  including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes  could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock 
we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons  including to finance our operations and business strategy  to adjust our ratio of debt to equity  to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons 
our stockholder rights plan and charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our stockholder rights plan and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing shareholder value 
however  such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control  which in turn  could harm our stock price

item legal proceedings in september  mckesson information solutions llc mckesson filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
in its complaint  mckesson alleged that we made  used  offered for sale  and or sold a clinical editing software system that infringed mckesson s united states patent no 
 entitled system and method for 
table of contents detecting fraudulent medical claims via examination of services codes 
mckesson sought injunctive relief and substantial monetary damages  including treble damages for willful infringement 
on april   in response to our motion for summary judgment  the court ruled  as a matter of law  that our software products did not infringe of the claims of mckesson s patent that were involved in this dispute  leaving claims  and on april   a jury trial commenced on the first phase of this case to determine the issue of infringement of the remaining three claims 
on april   the jury found that our facets  qiclink and claimfacts software products infringed claims and  but not claim of the patent 
on may   the court scheduled the second phase of the trial to commence on october  on the issues of our validity  estoppel and laches defenses and on the issue of mckesson s damages  if any 
on september   we entered into a settlement agreement with mckesson to settle the lawsuit 
as part of the settlement agreement  we agreed to pay mckesson a one time royalty fee of million for a license in the patent that covers past and future use of our products and services by all existing customers 
the million  payable in two equal installments on september  and september   was expensed in the third quarter of our customers with maintenance agreements also will continue to receive software version upgrades that include clinical editing capabilities 
going forward  we may continue to include our clinical editing functionality in versions of facets sold to new health plan customers with  or fewer members and in versions of qiclink sold to any new customers 
we have agreed to pay mckesson a royalty fee of of the net licensing revenue received from new sales of facets and qiclink containing our clinical editing functionality 
however  pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  we will no longer include clinical editing functionality in versions of facets sold to new customers with more than  members  beginning november  in these cases  new customers may choose their clinical editing solution from available third party providers

during the fourth quarter of  we decided to wind down our outsourcing services to physician group customers 
as a result of this decision  we estimated that the existing customer agreements would generate a total loss of million until the terms of these agreements expired in we recorded a loss accrual in the fourth quarter of through discussions and negotiations  we were able to accelerate the termination of our services agreements with certain physician group customers and implemented cost cutting measures that reduced the expected future costs to support our remaining customers 
as a result of these actions  we were able to reverse approximately million of previously accrued loss on contracts charges in early in the second quarter of  we executed termination agreements with our two remaining physician group customers 
we continued to provide outsourced business services through may  when the transition services were completed 
the completion of these services to the remaining customers allowed us to reverse the remaining balance in the loss on contracts accrual of million in the second quarter of the total amount of loss actually incurred related to the outsourcing services to physician group customers was million in and  in the first six months of in december  we negotiated a settlement regarding out of scope work related to one of our large fixed fee implementation projects 
as a result of this settlement  we estimated that this project would generate a total loss of million until its completion  which was expected to occur in mid we recorded a loss accrual in the fourth quarter of in  we determined that the large fixed fee implementation project would require a greater effort to complete than previously estimated 
as a result  we accrued an additional million of loss on contracts charges in the first six months of in the fourth quarter of  we negotiated a settlement of additional out of scope work  which decreased the total loss on the project and resulted in the reversal of approximately  of previously accrued loss on contracts charges 
this fixed fee implementation was completed by the end of the first quarter of the total amount of loss actually incurred on this project was million in and  in the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we made a decision to wind down our outsourcing services to physician groups and to discontinue our outsourcing services to certain non facets payer customers 
we estimated that our future net cash flows from the assets used in these businesses would not recover their net book value 
accordingly  a total charge of million was taken as a restructuring and impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  which represented the net book value of these assets 
the assets were written off in the first quarter of after the end of the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization decreased to a level that required us to perform additional analyses under fasb statement no 
to quantify the amount of impairment to goodwill 
this analysis resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill of million as of december  the decrease in market capitalization was also an indicator that our other intangible assets might also be impaired as of december   and they were also tested for impairment in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the analysis resulted in an additional impairment charge of million 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we offer a broad portfolio of proprietary information technology products and services targeted to the payer industry  which is comprised of health insurance plans and third party benefits administrators 
we offer enterprise claims administration software  including facets extended enterprise and qiclink extended enterprise  and enterprise cost and quality of care software  including clinical careadvance  personal careadvance and our networx suite for provider network management 
we also provide a number of component software solutions and add ons to the enterprise software solutions  including cdh account management  workflow  healthweb and benefit cost modeler 
to support these software products  we provide software hosting services and business process outsourcing services  giving customers variable cost alternatives to licensing software  as well as strategic  implementation and optimization consulting services 
as of december  we served unique customers in the health plan and benefits administrator markets  which we refer to as payers 
in  these markets represented approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
we measure financial performance by monitoring revenue  bookings and backlog  and net income 
total revenue for was million compared to million for services and other revenue for was million compared to million for products revenue for was million compared to million for operating costs and expenses for were million compared to million for bookings for were million compared to million for backlog at december  was million compared to million at december  net income in was million compared to million in these financial comparisons are further explained in the section below  results of operations 
we generate services revenue from several sources  including the provision of outsourcing services  such as software hosting and business process outsourcing services  the sale of maintenance and support for our proprietary and certain of our non proprietary software products  and from consulting fees for implementation  installation  configuration  business process engineering  data conversion  testing and training related to the use of our proprietary  and third party licensed products 
we generate products revenue from the licensing of our software 
cost of revenue includes costs related to the products and services we provide to our customers and costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our customer connectivity centers 
these costs include salaries and related expenses for consulting personnel  customer connectivity centers personnel  customer support personnel  application software license fees  amortization of capitalized software development costs  telecommunications costs  facility costs  and maintenance costs 
research and development r d expenses are salaries and related expenses associated with the development of software applications prior to establishing technological feasibility 
such expenses include compensation paid to software engineering personnel and other administrative  infrastructure and facility expenses and fees to outside contractors and consultants 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales  sales commissions  account management  marketing  administrative  finance  legal  human resources and executive personnel  and fees for certain professional services 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to increase revenue per customer by continuing to introduce new complementary products and services  including new cost and quality of care products and services  to our established enterprise software and hosting and business process outsourcing services 
some of these service offerings  including hosting  business process outsourcing  and consulting have a higher cost of revenue  resulting in lower gross profit margins 
therefore  to the extent that our revenue increases through the sale of these lower margin product and service offerings  our total gross profit margin may decrease 
we are continuing to target larger health plan customers 
this has given us the opportunity to sell additional services such as software hosting  business intelligence  and business process outsourcing services 
as the technology requirements of our customers become more sophisticated  our service offerings have become more complex 
this has lengthened our sales cycles and made it more difficult for us to predict the timing of our software and services sales 
in late  a management decision was made to exit certain non strategic and less profitable product offerings and business lines 
this decision included winding down services related to our physician group customers  as well as the planned elimination of our hosting and business process outsourcing services for two competing third party software platforms 
early in the second quarter of  we executed termination agreements with the last two of our remaining physician group customers 
we continued to provide outsourced business services through may when the transition services were completed 
on december   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of plan data management  inc the estimated purchase price as of december  was approximately million  which consisted of  shares of our common stock with a value of per share which represents the average closing price of trizetto s common stock for the trading days ending october   cash payments of million  assumed liabilities of million and estimated acquisition related costs of  due to the close of the acquisition late in the year  the issuance of the  shares of common stock and the cash payment of million to pdm stockholders and option holders were not completed prior to december  however  these amounts were accrued as of december  
table of contents the computation of earnings per share for the year ended december  did not include the issuance of the  shares of common stock or the financial operating results of pdm since the impact of these amounts was not material 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
those estimates are based on our experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  up front payments to customers  sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalization of software development costs  goodwill and other intangible assets  litigation accruals  self insurance  bonus accrual  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product or service has been delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and all other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
our revenue is classified into two categories services and other  and products 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue was generated from services and other revenue and was from products revenue 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  eitf issue  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  and eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we generate services revenue from several sources  including the provision of outsourcing services  such as software hosting and other business services  and the sale of maintenance and support for our proprietary software products 
we apply eitf to hosting arrangements that include the licensing of software 
a software element covered by sop is present in a hosting arrangement if the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software 
outsourcing services revenue is typically billed and recognized monthly over the contract term  generally three to seven years 
many of our outsourcing agreements require us to maintain a certain level of operating performance 
we record revenue net of estimated penalties resulting from any failure to maintain the level of operating performance 
these penalties have not been significant in the past 
software maintenance and support revenues are typically based on one year renewable contracts and are recognized ratably over the contract period 
payment for software maintenance received in advance is recorded on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
certain royalty costs paid to third party software vendors associated with software maintenance are amortized over the software maintenance period 
we also generate services revenue from consulting fees for implementation  installation  configuration  business process engineering  data conversion  testing and training related to the use of our proprietary and third party licensed products 
in certain instances  we also generate services revenue from customization services of our proprietary licensed products 
we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed 
when we cannot reasonably 
table of contents estimate the cost to complete  we recognize revenue using the completed contract method  upon completion of all contractual obligations 
we also generate services revenue from set up fees  which are services  hardware  and software associated with preparing our customer connectivity center or a customer s data center in order to ready a specific customer for software hosting services 
the set up fees are usually separate and distinct from the hosting fees  and performance of the set up services represents the culmination of the earnings process 
we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed 
we generate other revenue from certain one time charges  including certain contractual fees such as termination fees and change of control fees  and we recognize the revenue for these fees once the termination or change of control is guaranteed  there are no remaining substantive performance obligations and collection is reasonably assured 
other revenue is also generated from fees related to our product related conference 
for multiple element arrangements  such as software license  consulting services  outsourcing services and maintenance  and where vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method 
vsoe of fair value is determined for each undelivered element based on how it is sold separately  or in the case of maintenance  the renewal rate 
for arrangements in which vsoe does not exist for each undelivered element  including specified product and upgrade rights  revenue for the delivered element is deferred and not recognized until vsoe is available for the undelivered element or delivery of each element has occurred 
in determining vsoe for the undelivered elements  no portion of the discount is allocated to specified or unspecified product or upgrade rights 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is recognized as follows the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vsoe  is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with the relevant sections of sop and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we generate products revenue from the licensing of our software 
under sop  software license revenue is recognized upon the execution of a license agreement  upon delivery of the software  when fees are fixed or determinable  when collectibility is probable and when all other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
for software license agreements in which customer acceptance is a significant condition of earning the license fees  revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs 
for software license agreements that require significant customization or modification of the software  revenue is recognized as the customization services are performed 
up front payments to customers 
we may pay certain up front amounts to our customers in connection with the establishment of our hosting and outsourcing services contracts 
under eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  these payments are capitalized and amortized over the life of the contract as a reduction to revenue  provided that such amounts are recoverable from future revenue under the contract 
if an up front payment is not recoverable from future revenue  or it cannot be offset by contract cancellation penalties paid by the customer  the amount will be expensed in the period it is deemed unrecoverable 
unamortized up front fees were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts to reserve for estimated discounts  pricing adjustments  and other sales allowances 
the reserve is charged to revenue in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance at a level we believe is adequate based on historical experience and current trends 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we base this allowance on estimates after consideration of factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging and bad debt history and our evaluation of the financial condition of the customers 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional sales allowances and bad debt expense may be required 
we typically do not require collateral 
historically  our estimates for sales returns and doubtful account reserves have been adequate to cover accounts receivable exposures 
we continually monitor these reserves and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual credits or other allowances may differ from established reserves 
for the twelve month period ended december   our allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts increased by million 
in december  we entered into a settlement with one of our larger customers that had disputed payments due from a software implementation project 
the amounts represented revenue recorded in the first two quarters of and were included in the allowance for sales returns and a reduction to revenue in the quarter ended september  the settlement fully resolved the issues and resulted in a payment that was less than the amount previously disputed 
we do not believe the increase in the allowance for sales returns is a trend or representative of more significant issues in our business 
capitalization of software development costs 
the capitalization of software costs includes developed technology acquired in acquisitions and costs incurred by us in developing our products that qualify for capitalization 
we account for our software development costs  other than costs for internal use software  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize costs associated with product development  coding and testing subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of the product 
technological feasibility is established after completion of a detailed program design or working model 
capitalization of computer software costs ceases upon a product s 
table of contents general availability release 
capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software product starting from the date of general availability 
on a quarterly basis  we monitor the expected net realizable value of the capitalized software for factors that would indicate impairment  such as a decline in the demand  the introduction of new technology  or the loss of a significant customer 
as of december   our evaluation determined that the carrying amount of these assets was not impaired 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their estimated fair market values on the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 
under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual or more often if indicators of impairment exist impairment tests using a two step process 
the first step looks for indicators of impairment 
if indicators of impairment are revealed in the first step  then the second step is conducted to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
we performed our annual impairment test on march   and this test did not reveal indications of impairment 
litigation accruals 
pending unsettled lawsuits involve complex questions of fact and law and may require expenditure of significant funds 
from time to time  we may enter into confidential discussions regarding the potential settlement of such lawsuits  however  there can be no assurance that any such discussions will occur or will result in a settlement 
moreover  the settlement of any pending litigation could require us to incur settlement payments and costs 
in the period in which a new legal case arises  an expense will be accrued if our liability to the other party is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
on a quarterly basis  we review and analyze the adequacy of our accruals for each individual case for all pending litigations 
adjustments are recorded as needed to ensure appropriate levels of reserve 
our attorney fees and other defense costs related to litigation are expensed as incurred 
self insurance 
effective january   we became self insured for certain losses related to employee health and dental benefits 
we record a liability based on an estimate of claims incurred but not recorded determined based on actuarial analysis of historical claims experience and historical industry data 
we maintain individual and aggregate stop loss coverages with a third party insurer to limit our total exposure for these programs 
our self insurance liability contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our self insurance liability 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
bonus accrual 
our bonus model is designed to project the level of funding required under the bonus program as approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
a significant portion of the bonus program is based on the company meeting certain financial objectives  such as revenue  earnings per share  and the level of capital spending 
the expense related to the bonus program is accrued in the year of performance and paid in the first quarter following the fiscal year end 
the bonus model is analyzed and adjusted on a quarterly basis as necessary based on achievement of targets 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  fasb statement no 
requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such an asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
during  our valuation allowance decreased by million  million as a result of purchase accounting and related deferred tax accounting adjustments associated with the acquisition of carekey  inc carekey and million as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryovers and true ups 
of the remaining valuation allowance of million  approximately million will reverse through the income statement and approximately  will reverse to goodwill 

table of contents stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after january  and for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january  under the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate fair value which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation could be materially different in the future 
in addition  if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin applies to all tax positions accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date 
if a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained then no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
fin requires additional disclosures and is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

most of the revenue in our backlog is derived from multi year service revenue contracts including software hosting  business process outsourcing  it outsourcing  and software maintenance with periods up to seven years and consulting contracts 
consulting revenue is included in the backlog when the revenue from such consulting contract is expected to be recognized over a period exceeding months 
backlog can change due to a number of factors  including unforeseen changes in implementation schedules  contract cancellations subject to penalties paid by the customer  or customer financial difficulties 
in such event  unless we enter into new customer agreements that generate enough revenue to replace or exceed the revenue we expect to generate from our backlog in any given quarter  our backlog will decline 
our backlog at any date may not indicate demand for our products and services and may not reflect actual revenue for any period in the future

higher compensation costs were impacted by the annual merit increases in early  the adoption of sfas r and a reassignment of product and development leaders and other executives to more appropriately align their responsibilities with our market facing strategy 
higher infrastructure and technology costs were driven by customer and internal upgrades  new operating lease agreements for data center equipment and related maintenance
