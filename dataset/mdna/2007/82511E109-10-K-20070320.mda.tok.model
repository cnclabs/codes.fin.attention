item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s strong financial performance continued during producing record earnings of million for the year 
these results represented a increase over the million earned in and earned our shareholders a return of per diluted share compared to in many changes occurred during that affected the company s financial performance during the year 
the federal reserve continued its aggressive monetary policy of interest rate tightening during the first half of before deciding to pause during the summer 
even during this period of rate tightening the company s real estate loan production continued to thrive within its markets 
however  the affect of the federal reserve s actions began to negatively impact the company s net interest margin early in long term interest rates in the financial markets began to fall which caused the yield curve to flatten and eventually invert 
this occurrence along with an increasingly competitive deposit gathering market and a slowing of the loan production during the second half of resulted in a net interest margin of during the year  compared to in despite the impact that the declining net interest margin had on net interest income  the company s earnings benefited from several steps taken during and early to boost noninterest income 
the addition of a courtesy overdraft product helped increase deposit account fees to million during  representing a increase over the million generated in additionally  increased production from the company s investment brokers during  one of which was hired during with fifteen years experience  resulted in an increase in investment brokerage commissions of to  compared to  during the company also took advantage of investment portfolio profits by realizing  of net gains on sales of securities during  compared to  of gains on the sales of investments and real estate in the company s efficiency ratio remained relatively flat during at compared to for  with the shrinking net interest margin and an increase in noninterest expenses to million from million during impacting the ratio 
the majority of the expense increase occurred in compensation and benefits expense  primarily resulting from increases in commissions associated with operating the company s investment brokerage services  the expensing of stock options granted to non executive employees and general increases in compensation and other benefits 
the company also took on other customer service initiatives  including expansion of the bank s atm network by seventeen machines  additional internet banking services and other new deposit products 
the company s total assets grew to million at december   compared to million at december   primarily resulting from a increase in loans 
total gross loans ended the at million  compared to million at december   while total deposits ended the year at million  compared to million at december  continued growth in the bank s real estate loan portfolio  specifically those secured by one to four family residences and land  represented the largest portion of the increase 
the growth in deposits primarily occurred in the time deposit category 
aggressive competition for retail deposits in the bank s markets continued during making significant growth challenging 
as a result of the company s strong earnings  total shareholders equity grew to million at december   compared to million in equity at december  the bank s loan portfolio quality remained strong during the bank experienced net loan charge offs of  during which is of total loans  while the level of nonperforming assets to period end loans was at december  the bank had no other real estate owned oreo or other foreclosed assets at december  and maintained an allowance for loan losses to period end loans of 
results of operation general net interest income is the major component of the company s earnings and is equal to the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense 
interest income is derived from interest earning assets composed primarily of loans and securities 
interest expense results from interest bearing liabilities  primarily consisting of deposits and short term borrowings 
changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as changes in the yields earned and rates paid  determine changes in net interest income 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets and represents the company s net yield on its earning assets 
interest income compared to during the year ended december   the company earned million in interest income  representing a increase over the million earned for the year ended december  the company s net interest income benefited from growth in the its loan portfolio and improved yields on earning assets  but was negatively impacted by increasing cost of funding 
spearheaded by growth in average loans outstanding resulting from million on total loan production  average earning assets were million during  representing a million increase over average total loans increased million to million during from million during the bank s real estate mortgage loan portfolio experienced the most growth with an increase of in average balances outstanding  while average commercial loans increased and average consumer loans including home equity lines were flat 
real estate mortgage loan balances  which include construction loans  averaged during  while commercial and consumer loans averaged million and million  respectively 
the bank realized strong loan production during the first half of while production levels slowed to a more moderate pace during the second half of the year 
average securities declined by million to million during compared to million during the company used maturing securities to fund liquidity needs during due to limited opportunities in the investment market and the rising cost of funds  mostly due to a flat yield curve 
yields on earning assets continued to benefit from the company s asset sensitive financial position 
total yields improved to during compared to in loans yielded during the year  compared to during  resulting primarily from the repricing of adjustable rate loans and loan growth 
the maturity of lower yielding investment securities helped improve the yield on securities to during  compared to for the year ended december  compared to during the year ended december   the company earned million in interest income  compared to the million earned for the year ended december  growth in the company s loan portfolio and its asset sensitive position during a period of rising interest rates resulted in the increase in interest income 
additionally  the company continued to improve its assets mix by shifting assets from the investment portfolio to the higher yielding loan portfolio 
securities yielded during the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  average securities declined by million to million during compared to million during this decrease resulted from loan demand continuing to absorb available liquidity  benign deposit growth and a weak investment market  partially due to a flattening yield curve 
loans yielded during the year ended december   compared to during average total loans increased million  or  to million during from million during the bank s average commercial loan portfolio experienced another year of significant growth with an increase of since december  while average mortgage loans including construction loans experienced solid growth with an increase of 
average consumer loans including home equity lines were million for the year ended december   relatively flat when compared to the million average outstanding during the year ended december  although short term interest rates continued to rise during  longer term rates did not change significantly which allowed the real estate market to continue its expansion 
interest expense compared to as the yield curve became more inverted during  the company faced the challenge of obtaining cost effective funding to support its loan growth and other liquidity needs 
during the recent period of rising rates  customers became more interest rate sensitive and began moving funds out of lower yielding accounts into higher yielding accounts 
also  the uncertainty surrounding the direction of interest rates caused customers to demand shorter term time deposits as opposed those with longer terms 
as the retail deposit market became more competitive  the company looked to the wholesale funding markets for alternative liquidity needs 
although at different points in the wholesale markets provided less expensive funding than the retail market  the funds were still costly and  accordingly  negatively impacted the company s interest expense 
the company s interest expense increased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during average interest bearing liabilities increased to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from during to during total average deposits  including noninterest bearing demand deposits  increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the company s cost of funds including demand deposits was during  compared to for the year ended december  average checking and savings account balances were million during and the cost of these funds for the year was basis points  representing a basis point increase over the prior year 
average time deposit balances were million and the cost of these funds increased by basis points to for the year 
as part of the it s increased reliance on wholesale funding during  the bank purchased million of brokered deposits and average federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings increased by million to million during the year 
of the total fhlb borrowings outstanding at december   million represent amounts with fixed terms up to seven years while the remaining balance floats based on an overnight rate 
the cost of these funds increased basis points to during compared to during  an increase in the deposit market competition and a more opportunistic stock market inhibited the bank s ability to grow deposits 
as a result  the bank increased its reliance on wholesale funding to provide the liquidity needed to fund loan growth 
consequently  the company s interest expense increased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during average interest bearing liabilities increased to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from during to during total average deposits  including noninterest bearing demand deposits  increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the company s cost of funds including demand deposits was during  compared to for the year ended december  average checking and savings account balances were million during and the cost of these funds for the year was basis points  representing a basis point increase over the prior year 
average time deposit balances were million and the cost of these funds increased by basis points to for the year 
the company continued to benefit from a growing number of commercial customer relationships which resulted in an increase in average demand deposits of 
as a result of the bank also relying more on wholesale funding during  average fhlb borrowings increased by million to million during the year 
since the majority of this funding floats based on an overnight rate  the cost of these funds increased basis points to during net interest income compared to as previously discussed  the company s net interest margin was negatively impacted by the flat yield curve  resulting in a decline of basis points to 
the shape of the yield curve diluted the positive impact of being asset sensitive during  primarily due to the fact that funding rates  which are primarily short term  were increasing faster than rates on interest earning assets 
as a result  the company s net interest income was relatively flat at million during the year ended december  as compared to million in compared to the company s net interest margin improved during despite a trend of declining margins in the banking industry 
the company s net interest margin increased from during to during the company continues to benefit from its asset sensitive balance sheet position which was advantageous during the period of rising rates that occurred since june however  the interest rate yield curve has flattened in recent  diluting the impact of the company s asset sensitive balance sheet position 
as a result of being asset sensitive and the bank s ability to grow loans  the company s net interest income increased to million during the year ended december  as compared to million in the following tables illustrate average balances of total interest earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated  showing the average distribution of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity and the related income  expense  and corresponding weighted average yields and costs

the tax equivalent adjustment to net interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest rate spread is the average yield earned on earning assets less the average rate incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is derived by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets

using this model  management determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments in order to manage sensitivity risk 
these decisions are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the local and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
an important element of the company s asset liability management process is monitoring its interest sensitivity gap 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities at a specific time interval 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during a given period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter maturities would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap within shorter maturities would have the opposite effect 
this gap can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  by selling investments available for sale  by replacing an asset or liability at maturity  or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
matching the amounts of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates

all securities without specific maturities are included in the to years category since they are not considered as sensitive to interest rate changes 
management has determined that interest checking and savings accounts  excluding  in savings accounts with more frequent rate adjustment terms  are not sensitive to changes in related market rates and  therefore  they are placed in the to years and over years categories  respectively 
noninterest income compared to during  the company continued to benefit in growth of noninterest income  primarily in the areas of deposit account fees and investment brokerage commissions 
during the year ended december   noninterest income increased to million from million in  representing a increase 
the addition of a courtesy overdraft product helped increase deposit account fees to million during  representing a increase over the million generated in deposit account fees consist of charges related insufficient funds  check printing  cashiers checks  service charges  atm  check cards and others 
these fees are core earnings that are not interest sensitive and have provided a stable source of income for the bank 
investment brokerage commissions benefited from increased production by the company s investment brokers during  one of which was hired during with fifteen years experience 
this resulted in an increase in investment brokerage commissions of to  compared to  during the company also experienced growth of and in loan fees and other income  respectively  and took advantage of investment portfolio profits by realizing  of net gains on sales of securities during  compared to  of gains on the sales of investments and real estate in loan fees primarily consist of late charges and prepayment penalties on loans and are also considered core earnings for the bank 
compared to during the year ended december   noninterest income increased to million from million in  representing a increase 
noninterest income benefited from growth in the company s ancillary service sectors which include mortgage banking and investment brokerage services 
the bank s mortgage banking division produced  in fees during  while the investment brokerage subsidiary generated  in commissions during the year 
during  the company s investment subsidiary hired a new investment officer with over fifteen years of experience 
the addition of this seasoned broker along with the other brokerage representatives and service offerings provided by the company should result in additional growth in this sector 
other factors positively impacting noninterest income during include gains on sales of securities of  and a one time gain on the sale of real estate of  deposit account and loan fees increased and  respective during deposit account fees consist of charges related insufficient funds  check printing  cashiers checks  service charges  atm  check cards and others  while loan fees primarily consist of late charges and prepayment penalties on loans

asset quality allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents an amount management believes is adequate to provide for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a regular basis using a methodology that considers various risk factors in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
this methodology includes analyzing historical loan losses  existing doubtful accounts  the experience of its lenders  growth by loan category  specific loan risk ie construction loans  economic conditions and loan to value considerations 
the outcome of this methodology results in range that is used to determine the bank s allowance for loan losses 
however  risks of future losses cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because those risks are influenced by general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  management s judgment of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
the allowance is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies 
set forth below is a table detailing the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated 
allowance for loan losses years ended december  dollars in thousands balance  beginning of period loans charged off commercial real estate mortgage consumer total loans charged off recoveries commercial real estate mortgage consumer total recoveries net recoveries charge offs provision for loan losses balance  end of period allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at end of period allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans outstanding at end of period net charge offs recoveries to average loans outstanding during period during  as has been the case over the past five years  the bank s charge offs continued to be minimal 
over the past five years  charge offs have primarily occurred in the consumer loan category 
during  the bank obtained possession of additional property related to a loan of which  was charged during during  the bank sold the property  recovered all deficient amounts and recognized a gain of  although growth in the bank s loan portfolio during primarily occurred in the residential real estate category  a significant emphasis has been place on growing the commercial and consumer loan categories over the last several years 
increased competition in the real estate mortgage arena and the desire to diversify contributed to this shift in lending and customer relationships 
however  with this change comes increased risk associated with potential loan losses 
based on the results of management s analysis  it believes that allowances for losses existing at december  are sufficient to cover any anticipated or unanticipated losses on loans outstanding in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
an allocation of the allowance for loan losses in dollars and as a percent of the total allowance is provided in the following tables 
because all of these factors are subject to change  the allocation is not necessarily predictive of future loan losses in the indicated categories 
allocation of allowance for loan losses commercial real estate consumer allowance for loan losses percentage of loan allowance allowance for loan losses percentage of loan allowance allowance for loan losses percentage of loan allowance dollars in thousands december  the following table details information concerning nonaccrual and past due loans  as well as foreclosed assets 
nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans commercial real estate mortgage home equity lines of credit consumer total nonaccrual loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans past due or more days accruing interest allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans nonperforming assets to period end loans and other real estate owned total nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans and foreclosed properties that are not producing income for the bank 
the bank s policy is that whenever a loan reaches days delinquent interest accruals are suspended until six months after the loan becomes current again 
in recent years  the bank has experienced strong asset quality in its loan portfolio 
low interest rates and an exuberant real estate market have created a vibrant lending environment and provided borrowers the opportunity to finance larger purchases at lower costs 
accordingly  trends in total nonperforming assets and the related ratios have been relatively positive for the periods presented 
at december   the bank identified one loan totaling  as impaired as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
however  the bank did not allocate a valuation allowance for this loan at december  at december   the bank identified  of loans as impaired as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
impaired loans at december had a valuation allowance allocation of  at december   no loans were identified by the bank as impaired and  accordingly  no specific allowances were provided with respect to impaired loans 
included in nonaccrual loans at december  and is one impaired loan to the same borrower with a balance of  and  respectively 
the balance was partially paid and brought current during however  the borrower was unable to meet the remaining obligation and  consequently  filed for bankruptcy protection 
the bank entered into an agreement with the bankruptcy trustee to sell the collateral during the first quarter of proceeds from these sales were sufficient to satisfy all principal and interest amounts due 
in conjunction with the methodology described above to calculate the allowance for loan losses  the bank closely monitors individual loans that are deemed to be potential problem loans 
loans are viewed as potential problem loans when possible credit problems of borrowers or industry trends cause management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with current repayment terms 
those loans are subject to regular management attention  and their status is reviewed on a regular basis 
in instances where management determines that a specific allowance should be set  the bank takes such action as deemed appropriate 
as of december   all loans days or more delinquent  including nonperforming loans  totaled million 
additionally  other performing loans totaling million existed that were current  but had other potential weaknesses that management considers to warrant additional monitoring 
all loans in these categories are subject to constant management attention  and their status is reviewed on a regular basis 
these loans are generally secured by residential and commercial real estate and equipment with appraised values that exceed the remaining principal balances on such loans 
liquidity  asset management liquidity represents the company s ability to meet present and future obligations through the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold  investments maturing within one year  and investments that are categorized as available for sale 
the company s ability to obtain deposits and purchase funds at favorable rates impacts its liability liquidity 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositor s requirements and meet its customers credit needs 
the table below summarizes the company s balance sheet liquidity position for the periods presented 
additionally  alternative sources of liquidity are available to the company in the wholesale funding markets including its capacity to borrow additional funds or purchased brokered certificates of deposits 
the bank has an available line of credit with the fhlb for up to of bank assets  or approximately million at december  however  the bank may request an increase in this borrowing capacity from the fhlb 
at december  the bank had sufficient collateral pledged to borrow a total of approximately million from the fhlb 
the borrowing capacity is subject to certain collateral requirements as stipulated in the fhlb borrowing agreement 
additionally  the bank maintains other available borrowing arrangements of approximately million 
based on these factors  the company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated needs

net cash flows from operating activities were million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this fluctuation primarily resulted from net income growth and other changes in normal operating activities during the periods 
net cash flows used for investing activities were million during the year ended december   compared to million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
steady loan growth continued with net originations of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
other investment activities continued to be slow due to liquidity needs for loan growth 
net cash flows from financing activities were million for the year ended december   compared to million and million during and  respectively 
deposits increased million in  primarily due to growth in time deposits  compared to a decline of million during and growth of million in as was the case in  the bank s deposit markets continued to be very competitive during  resulting in a more challenging environment to grow retail deposits profitably 
therefore  wholesale funding sources continued to be used during to fund liquidity shortfalls 
in the past  the bank had primarily used fhlb borrowings as its main wholesale funding source 
however  the bank purchased million of brokered time deposits during since they were a less expensive alternative funding source than fhlb advances at that time 
accordingly  net proceeds from fhlb borrowings were fairly flat at million during  compared to million and million during and  respectively 
proceeds from wholesale funds were used to fund loan growth during the bank occasionally finds it necessary to borrow funds on a short term basis due to fluctuations in loan and deposit levels 
the bank has several arrangements whereby it may borrow funds overnight and on terms 
as discussed above  the bank currently has borrowing capacity of approximately million  provided it meets all borrowing guidelines with the fhlb

these policies require the use of subjective and complex estimates  assumptions and judgments  which are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and are important to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  as this information changes  our financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained at levels management deems adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio  based upon our evaluation of the risks in the portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
management evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a regular basis using a methodology that considers historical loan losses  existing doubtful accounts  the experience of its lenders  growth by loan category  specific loan risk ie construction loans  economic conditions and loan to value considerations 
additionally  we consider the impact of economic events and other market factors  the outcome of which is uncertain 
while we use the best information available in establishing the allowance  actual economic conditions differing significantly from our assumptions in determining the loan loss valuation allowance may result in future adjustments  or regulators may require adjustments based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations 
although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate and properly recorded in our financial statements  differing economic conditions or alternate methods of estimation could result in materially different amounts of loan losses 
the estimation of fair value is significant to several of our assets  including available for sale afs investment securities and real estate owned reo 
afs securities are recorded at fair value  while reo is generally recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs 
fair values can be volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and market conditions  among others 
since these factors can change significantly and rapidly  fair values are difficult to predict and are subject to material changes  which could impact our financial condition

in september  the securities and exchange commission the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which provides detail in the quantification and correction of financial statement misstatements 
sab specifies that companies should apply a combination of the rollover and iron curtain methodologies when making determinations of materiality 
the rollover method quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement 
the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  regardless of the year s of origination 
sab instructs companies to quantify the misstatement under both methodologies and  if either method results in the determination of a material error  the company must adjust its financial statements to correct the error 
sab also reminds preparers that a change from an accounting principle that is not generally accepted to a principle that is generally accepted is a correction of an error

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses a third party provider to perform computer modeling methodologies that assist in determining the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk 
based on these methodologies  management formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments in order to reduce sensitivity risk 
these decisions are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the local and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
the modeling methodologies used measure interest rate sensitivity by analyzing the potential impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
one such scenario would assume a hypothetical basis point instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve in interest rates 
accordingly  management modeled the impact of a basis point decline in interest rates and a basis point increase in interest rates at december  the model indicates that a basis point instantaneous and parallel decrease in the yield curve in interest rates would cause net interest income to increase by  while a basis point instantaneous and parallel increase in the yield curve in interest rates would cause net interest income to decrease by  the computer model uses standard algebraic formula for calculating present value 
the calculation discounts the future cash flows of the company s portfolio of interest rate sensitive instruments to present value utilizing techniques designed to approximate current market rates for securities  current offering rates for loans  and the cost of alternative funding for the given maturity of deposits and then assumes an instantaneous and parallel shift in these rates 
the difference between these numbers represents the resulting hypothetical change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments 
as with any modeling techniques  certain limitations and shortcomings are inherent in the company s methodology 
significant assumptions must be made in the calculation including no growth in volume or balance sheet mix  constant market interest rates reflecting the average rate from the last month of the given quarter  and pricing spreads to market rates derived from an historical analysis  or from assumptions by instrument type 
additionally  the computations do not contemplate certain actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates
