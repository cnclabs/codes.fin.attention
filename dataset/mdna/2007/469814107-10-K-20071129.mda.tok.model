item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 
significant customers the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the five fiscal years ended september it is rare for a commercial customer to contribute or more of the company s total revenue 
on occasion  however  we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which  primarily because of the amount of pass through costs discussed below that is included in revenue  will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed of total consolidated revenues 
for the fiscal year ended september  revenues earned from valero energy corporation accounted for of total consolidated revenues 

table of contents financial information about geographic areas the financial information regarding geographic areas in which we operate is included in note segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k and is incorporated herein by reference 
contracts while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake  our contracts generally fall into three broad categories cost reimbursable  fixed price  and guaranteed maximum price 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the five fiscal years ended september cost reimbursable fixed price guaranteed maximum price in accordance with industry practice  most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 
when we are directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement  and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client s plant or facility  we reflect the costs of materials  equipment  and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly  and we have no associated responsibility for such items  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such pass through costs included in revenues for each of the five fiscal years ended september in thousands of dollars cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit 
the profit element may be in the form of a simple mark up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee  or a combination of a mark up and a fee 
the fee element can also take several forms 
the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract  it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred  or it may be an incentive fee based on targets  milestones  or performance factors defined in the contract 
in general  we prefer cost reimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts include both lump sum bid contracts and negotiated fixed price contracts 
under lump sum bid contracts  we are required to bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes 
this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received  problems with new technologies  and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
additionally  it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients  which is contrary to our relationship based business model 
accordingly  lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract 
under a negotiated fixed price contract  we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client 
negotiated fixed price contracts frequently exist in single responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project 
thus  although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client  the lump sum bid 
table of contents contract provides the greater degree of risk to us 
however  because of economies that may be realized during the contract term  both negotiated fixed price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts 
over the past five years  most of our fixed price work has been either negotiated fixed price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services  rather than turn key construction 
guaranteed maximum price contracts guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as cost reimbursable contracts  however  the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client 
if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price  then we will bear at least some  if not all  of the excess 
in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price  we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client 
these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients  which is contrary to our relationship based business model 
competition for information regarding the competitive conditions in our business  please refer to item a risk factors  below 
employees at september   we had approximately  full time  staff employees including contract staff 
additionally  as of september   there were approximately  persons employed in the field on a project basis 
the number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time

risk factors we engage in a highly competitive business 
increased competition for professional services could reduce our market share and profits 
there is intense competition to provide the various technical professional services and construction and construction management services we provide 
the extent of such competition varies according to the industries and markets in which our clients operate as well as the geographic areas in which we operate 
the degree and type of competition we face is also often influenced by the type of projects for which we compete 
for example  with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services  clients generally award large projects multi million dollar design build and program management projects  for example to large contractors 
some of our competitors are larger and may possess greater resources than we do  which may give them an advantage when bidding for certain of these large projects 
conversely  the relatively small amount of capital required for a business providing engineering  design  architectural  and consulting services creates a relative ease of market entry for a new entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications and certifications 
as a result  our competitors range from small  local or regional firms to large  national and international organizations 
if we are unable to compete effectively in the geographic areas in which we operate  we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both 

table of contents our larger competitors for engineering  construction  and maintenance services for process plants include the bechtel corporation  fluor corporation  foster wheeler ltd  washington group international  kbr  inc  aker kvaerner  technip  worleyparsons  and amec plc 
in the area of buildings  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr  inc  hellmuth  obata kassabaum  aecom technology  and turner construction 
in the area of infrastructure  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff  urs corporation  hntb  tetra tech inc  parsons corporation  and ws atkins 
in the area of us federal programs  our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as the shaw group  saic  chm hill  weston solutions  lockheed martin corporation  and computer sciences corporation 
and in the area of pulp and paper  our principal competitors include be k and amec plc 
our continued success is dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
there is intense demand for employees who are able to perform the services we provide 
the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel  including engineers  architects  designers  and corporate management professionals who have the necessary and required experience and expertise 
in addition  there is significant demand for qualified craft personnel in the geographic areas where our construction and maintenance sites are located 
in certain geographic areas we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 
if we cannot find and retain highly qualified and trained engineers  architects  designers and corporate management employees or hire skilled craft personnel as needed  it could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the nature of our business occasionally results in clients  subcontractors and vendors presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur  or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible 
similarly  and in the normal course of business  we may present claims and change orders to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible or for services provided that were either requested by the client or were otherwise required by the nature of the project 
if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients  subcontractors  and vendors  we could incur cost overruns and experience reduced profits or  in some cases  suffer a loss for that project 
additionally  irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders  the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation 
generally  such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance 
most of the litigation in which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  employment labor  professional liability  and other similar lawsuits 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
however  we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits  and retentions under our insurance programs which may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured  or completely uninsured 
construction sites and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces 
if we fail to maintain safe work sites  we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal proceedings 
construction sites and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces 
construction and maintenance projects often require putting our employees in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment  moving vehicles  chemical and manufacturing processes  and highly regulated materials 
on those projects where we are responsible for site safety  we are obligated to implement procedures to ensure that workers are not injured 
in the event we either fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective  our employees and other may become injured  and we could incur significant financial losses 
in addition  the company could be found liable for failing to comply with government regulations dealing with occupational health and safety 

table of contents regulations dealing with occupational health and safety are continually evolving 
we maintain functional groups within the company whose primary purpose is to ensure that effective health  safety  and environmental hse work procedures are implemented throughout our organization  including construction sites and maintenance sites 
in spite of these efforts  the company could suffer losses relating to safety issues at our construction and maintenance sites  or fail to comply with all hse regulations applicable to our business 
we perform certain contracts through partnerships and joint ventures 
participation in joint ventures exposes us to certain other risks and uncertainties 
as is common in the industry  we execute certain contracts jointly with other contractors through various forms of joint ventures  including general partnerships 
these arrangements expose us to a number of risks  including the risk that our partners may not be able to fulfill their obligations under the partnership agreements and related client contracts 
there is also a risk that our partners may be incapable of providing the required financial support to the partnerships 
disputes can arise not only between us and our joint venture partners  but also between the joint ventures and the clients 
the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted  cancelled or suspended by our clients 
additionally  even if fully performed  our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins 
at september   our backlog totaled approximately billion 
in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client 
in addition  our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the amount of backlog in hand at september  will actually be realized as revenues 
the gross margins ie  contract revenue less direct costs of contracts can vary considerably between contracts 
one aspect of our business that can have a significant effect on the gross margins we realize on our contracts and projects is the amount of pass through costs incurred 
when we are directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client s plant or facility  we reflect the costs of materials  equipment  and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly  and we have no associated responsibility for such items  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
since pass through costs typically do not bring significant margins with them  it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding change in our gross margins 
additionally  the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence  future profitability 
in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
typically  our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs  overall safety performance  overall client satisfaction  and or other performance criteria 
if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards  we may receive a lower  or even zero  incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog  assuming they produce the revenues currently expected  will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 
our business is dependent on the timing and funding of new awards  and we are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate 
we provide technical professional  and construction services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration  production  and refining  long term programs for various national governments  including the us  chemicals and polymers  pharmaceuticals and biotechnology  infrastructure  buildings  and other  general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing  pulp and paper  food and consumer products  and mining and minerals 
these individual markets are generally cyclical in nature 
because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards  we 
table of contents are therefore vulnerable to unanticipated downturns in our clients markets and industries 
as a result  our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the industries listed above  and the geographic regions in which we operate 
contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 
contracts with the united states and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties  restrictions and regulations  including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls 
in the us  government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with congressional funding 
the us federal government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level  and funds for a program may even be eliminated 
in addition  us government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio economic requirements 
for example  we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation  the truth in negotiations act  the cost accounting standards  the service contract act  and department of defense security regulations 
we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices  environmental protection  recordkeeping and accounting 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  requirements or statutes  our existing government contracts could be terminated  and we could be temporarily suspended or even debarred from government contracting or subcontracting 
we also run the risk of the effects of government audits  investigations and proceedings  and so called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act that  if an unfavorable result occurs  could impact our profits and financial condition  as well as our ability to obtain future government work 
for example  government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors 
if these agencies determine that a rule or regulation has been violated  a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages  and criminal and civil penalties  all of which would harm our reputation with the government or even debar us from future government activities 
if one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason including for convenience  if we are suspended from government contract work  or if payment of our costs is disallowed  we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits 
we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed price and guaranteed maximum price contracts these contracts accounted for approximately of our fiscal revenues 
we may experience reduced profits or  in some cases  losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 
for the year ended september   approximately of our revenues was earned under contracts that were either fixed price or guaranteed maximum price in nature 
for such contracts  we bear the risk of paying some  if not all  of any cost overruns 
under fixed price and guaranteed maximum price contracts  contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates which are based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about future economic conditions  prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other exigencies 
if these estimates prove inaccurate  or if circumstances change such as unanticipated technical problems  difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals  changes in local laws or labor conditions  weather delays  cost of raw materials or our suppliers or subcontractors inability to perform  cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications can also lead to cost overruns 

table of contents international operations  unfavorable political developments  natural disasters and weak foreign economies may seriously harm our financial condition 
for the year ended september   approximately of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations  and we expect that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
at a minimum  our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  into the us dollar 
in addition  our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including recessions in foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  the adoption of new  and the expansion of existing  trade restrictions  acts of war and terrorism  the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations  social  political and economic instability  limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings  and natural disasters or other crises  such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome commonly known as sars or avian bird flu 
rising inflation  interest rates and or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts  in particular with respect to our fixed price contracts 
because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost reimbursable type contracts approximately during fiscal the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor 
however  we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed price and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximum price 
in addition  rising inflation  interest rates and or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services 
furthermore  if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed price and lump sum work is more prevalent  inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future 
therefore  increases in inflation  interest rates and or construction costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth 
acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 
our business strategy involves growth through  among other things  the acquisition of other companies 
such growth involves a number of risks  including difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a combined  integrated  and efficient business  diversion of management s attention from day to day operations  assumption of liabilities of an acquired business  including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition transaction was negotiated  failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations  
table of contents potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition  difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel  services and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities  and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 
in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make  we could dilute share ownership 
we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions 
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
should we issue additional equity securities  such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders individual ownership percentages in the company 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 
we are a delaware corporation 
certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us 
in addition  certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover 
for example our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms  only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board  there are various restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to nominate a director for election  and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares 
these types of provisions  as well as our shareholder rights agreement  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
accordingly  stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

table of contents critical accounting policies in order to understand better the changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results  a reader of this md a should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing long term engineering and construction type contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities 
although our significant accounting polices are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures in accounting for long term engineering and construction type contracts  we follow the provisions of the aicpa s statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in general  we recognize revenues at the time we provide services 
depending on the commercial terms of the contract  we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred  or using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion 
this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule  the cost of materials and labor  and productivity  and the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes  and achievement of contractual performance standards 
many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee 
in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
in certain instances  we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates  target costs  and or other performance criteria 
failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs  which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 
one such incentive fee contract is with the us department of energy for the fernald closure project the fernald project 
this contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule and cost 
in addition  the terms of the contract provide that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the doe until the completion of the project  which we estimate to occur in fiscal at september  and there was million and million  respectively  of fees relating to the fernald project recognized as receivables in our consolidated balance sheets 
we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
the nature of our business sometimes results in clients  subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur  or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible 
in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract  we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore  the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate  based on all relevant facts and circumstances available  of the additional costs to be incurred 
similarly  and in the normal course of business  we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible 
in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients  we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred  without profit  to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue  and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 
certain cost reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment 
in this situation  revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts 
in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract  we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

table of contents as is common in the industry  we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums 
for certain of these joint ventures ie  where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture  we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues  costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings 
for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures  we use the equity method of accounting 
accounting for stock issued to employees and others effective october   we began accounting for stock issued to employees and outside directors in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment 
sfas r superseded apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and requires that we measure the value of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the computed fair value is recognized as a non cash cost over the period the employee provides services 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the grant date fair value of the award 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical  fair value of a stock option 
changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option 
the value assigned to any stock options that may be awarded in the future as well as the related expense associated with any such awards will be dependent on the assumptions used 
accounting for pension plans in accounting for pension plans  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost  and the value of the plans assets and liabilities 
these assumptions involve discount rates  investment returns  and projected salary increases  among others 
we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans  and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used 
the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal ranged from to  which is unchanged from last year 
we believe this range of rates reflects the long term returns expected on the plans assets  considering projected rates of inflation  the diversification of the plans assets  and the expected real rates of market returns 
the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of to in fiscal to a range of to in fiscal changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans assets and liabilities  and the associated pension expense 
management  together with our actuaries  monitor trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 
in september  the fasb issued sfas sfas requires companies to i recognize the funded statuses of their single employer  defined benefit postretirement plans as assets or liabilities in their balance sheets  ii recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses that arise during the period being reported but are not recognized as a component of periodic benefit cost under existing accounting rules  and iii measure defined benefit pension plan assets and obligations as of the date of the sponsor s balance sheet 
in fiscal  we were required to initially recognize the funded statuses of our defined benefit pension plans in our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a million after tax gain in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the other provisions of sfas relating to the change in measurement date of the plans assets and liabilities is effective for fiscal years ending after december  ie  september  for us 
the change in measurement date is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  and other  applicable authoritative pronouncements 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the normal course of business  we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  the tax returns we file are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the 
table of contents united states  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we routinely monitor the appropriateness of our worldwide tax rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on an entity s tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  ie  fiscal for us 
we continue to evaluate the impact of fin but do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
insurance matters  litigation  claims  and contingencies in the normal course of business  we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation 
the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance 
most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  employment labor  professional liability  and other similar lawsuits 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we have elected  however  to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles  limits  and retentions under our insurance programs 
this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured  or completely uninsured 
we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims  guarantees  litigation  and audits and investigations 
we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for insurance related claims that are known and have been asserted against us  and for insurance related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis  but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates 
we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the united states federal government  we are subject to many levels of audits  investigations  and claims by  or on behalf of  the us federal government with respect to contract performance  pricing  costs  cost allocations  and procurement practices 
testing goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the amount of goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment 
in conducting the impairment test  we may apply  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
the values resulting from the application of these valuation techniques are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party 
foreign currencies we transact business in various currencies 
the functional currency of each of our foreign operations is the currency of the local country 
consequently  and in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation  revenues and expenses of operations outside the united states are translated into us dollars using weighted average exchange rates for the applicable period s being translated while the assets and liabilities of operations outside the united states are translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates 
the net effect of the foreign currency translation process translating the income statement accounts at rates that are different from those used to translate the balance sheet accounts is included in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our net exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is limited because  in general  our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective functional currencies 
in 
table of contents situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies  we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 
in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies  we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies 
in those situations  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accounting for our derivative contracts 
results of operations general our business focuses exclusively on providing technical  professional  and construction services to a large number of industrial  commercial  and governmental clients around the world 
the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which includes engineering  design  architectural  and similar services  process  scientific  and systems consulting services which includes services performed in connection with a wide variety of scientific testing  analysis  and consulting activities  construction services which encompasses traditional field construction services as well as modular construction activities  and includes direct hire construction and construction management services  and operations and maintenance services which includes services performed in connection with operating large  complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as services involving process plant maintenance 
the scope of services we can provide our clients  therefore  ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete  single responsibility  design build operate contracts 
the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended september in thousands technical professional services revenues project services process  scientific  and systems consulting total technical professional services revenues field services revenues construction operations and maintenance total field services revenues 
table of contents we focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets 
we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit cross utilization of our resources 
the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended september in thousands energy refining downstream a national government programs chemicals and polymers oil gas upstream a pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings industrial and other b a in prior annual reports  these amounts were combined into one category called oil gas and refining 
prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation 
b includes projects for our clients operating in the technology and manufacturing  pulp and paper  food and consumer products  and basic resources industries  among others 
fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal year ended september   compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share for fiscal total revenues for fiscal increased by billion  or  to billion  compared to total revenues of billion for fiscal revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve  lead by a combined  million increase  or  in revenues from clients operating in the energy and refining  and the upstream oil and gas industries 
also contributing to the revenue growth in fiscal were a million increase  or  in revenues from projects for our national government programs clients  a million increase  or  in revenues from projects for our clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries  and a million increase  or  in revenues from projects for our infrastructure clients 
with respect to projects for our clients operating in the oil gas and refining industries  revenue from the downstream sector grew by million  or  from last year 
most of this increase continues to relate to higher capital spending on projects involving the reconfiguration and expansion of existing refineries  and addressing the effects of changing crude inputs from lighter crudes to heavier crudes that contain slightly higher levels of sulfur 
more recently  we have seen increased capital spending by many of our refinery clients involving projects driven by government regulations 
these include projects to comply with the nonroad diesel emission and other similar standards 
revenue from the upstream sector of the oil gas and refining industries grew by million  or  from last year 
we continued to see a high level of spending in fiscal by our clients on oil and gas extraction projects  particularly in the oil sands area of canada 
revenues from projects for our national government programs clients increased by million  or  from last year 
most of the increase was due to higher levels of revenue from the us federal government relating to various aerospace and defense projects 
revenues from projects for our clients in the chemicals and polymers industries increased by million  or  due to continued demand to increase production capacity 
revenues from projects performed for our infrastructure clients increased by million  or  
table of contents from last year 
part of the increase was due to the acquisition of edwards and kelcey  inc edwards and kelcey in april edwards and kelcey contributed million in revenues during fiscal the balance of the increase in infrastructure revenues was due to higher spending by clients on projects for improved roads  highways  and bridges 
included in the above increase in revenues was a million increase in pass through costs 
pass through costs totaled  million in fiscal compared to  million in fiscal when we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment  we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs 
the level of pass through costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves  as opposed to using our services  as well as on the normal ramping up and winding down of field services activities on construction and o m projects 
pass through costs as a percentage of field services revenues in fiscal and were essentially unchanged 
as a percentage of revenues  direct costs of contracts were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal for the remainder of this md a  we refer to this percentage relationship as the dc 
the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided 
generally speaking  the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie  where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects  and or procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical  professional services revenues  the higher the dc will be 
because pass through costs typically generate lower margins  it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues relating to pass through costs without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit 
the decrease in the dc in fiscal as compared to last year was due primarily to the increase in technical professional services revenues relative to field services revenues 
also contributing to the decrease in the dc was a slight increase in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 
sg a expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal the increase in sg a expenses was due almost entirely to the business growth we experienced in fiscal  particularly in support of the technical professional services area of our business 
generally speaking  such services require higher labor and facilities costs in order to support those activities 
also contributing to the increase in sg a expenses was the acquisition of edwards and kelcey  which contributed million of sg a expenses in fiscal operating profit for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  operating profit was for fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in operating profit during fiscal as compared to last year was due primarily to the increase in technical professional services revenues  the improvement in our level of sg a expenses relative to technical professional services revenues  and a slight improvement in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 
interest income for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher average cash balances on deposit during fiscal as compared to last year combined with a slight increase in the rate of interest earned on our deposits 
we recorded income tax expense of million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal our overall effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to last year 
the company s overall effective tax rate for fiscal was positively affected by the favorable settlement of a matter with the us internal revenue service irs  off set in part by provisions recorded for certain other income tax exposures 
the net effect of the irs settlement and the other income tax exposures was a net reduction of million to the fiscal total tax expense 
in the normal course of our business  we may 
table of contents engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  we file income  franchise  gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions 
our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the united states  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states 
we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 
fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal year ended september   compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share for fiscal total revenues for fiscal increased by billion  or  to billion  compared to total revenues of billion for fiscal revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve  lead by a increase in revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers markets  and a increase in revenues from clients operating in the energy and refining downstream industries 
the increase in revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers markets was driven by demand by a number of our clients to increase capacity 
the increase in revenues from our clients operating in the oil gas and refining industries was due primarily to new and continuing projects reconfiguring existing refineries in order to increase production and address the effects of changing crude inputs from lighter crudes to heavier crudes that contain slightly higher levels of sulfur 
also contributing to the increase in revenues were new awards in the oil gas upstream market relating to oil sands extraction projects  as well as a  million increase in pass through costs 
the increase in pass through costs from fiscal to was consistent with the overall increase in field services revenues 
the dc was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the increase in the dc in fiscal from fiscal was due to the increase in field services activity combined with slightly lower fees from our technical professional services revenues  off set in part by slightly higher fees from field services 
we were successful in keeping sg a growth in line with our increased business activity during fiscal sg a expenses during fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million during fiscal contributing to the increase in sg a expenses was increased professional technical services activity and the effects of foreign currency translation 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal sg a expense as a percentage of gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal contributing to the decrease in these relationships is the result of increased field services activity  which generally requires less sg a expense to support 
operating profit for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million during fiscal the increase in operating profit during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the overall increase in business activity 
as a percentage of revenues  operating profit was for fiscal compared to in fiscal notwithstanding the increase in the direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenue  the company was able to increase its operating profit by limiting the increase in sg a expenses 
interest income increased by million to million during fiscal  compared to million of interest income during fiscal included in interest income for fiscal is million relating to the favorable settlement of a matter with the irs discussed below 
the balance of the increase in interest income was a result of higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense increased by million to million during fiscal  compared to million of interest expense during fiscal the increase in interest expense is due primarily to higher levels of borrowing by our operations outside the us in support of the growth in business combined with slightly higher interest rates 

table of contents we recorded income tax expense of million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal our overall effective tax rate was during fiscal compared to for fiscal the overall effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted by the favorable settlement of a matter with the irs  off set in part by provisions recorded for certain other income tax exposures 
the net effect of the irs settlement and the other income tax exposures was a net reduction to the company s income tax expense of million 
impacting the overall effective tax rate for fiscal was certain stock based compensation expense amounts relating to the company s employee stock purchase plans where no tax benefit was available to the company 
in the normal course of our business  we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  we file income  franchise  gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions 
our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the united states  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states 
we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september  in thousands payments due by fiscal period total year or less years years more than years long term debt obligations operating leases a obligations under defined benefit pension plans b obligations under nonqualified deferred compensation plans c purchase obligations d total a assumes the company will make end of lease term residual value guarantee payments of million in and million in with respect to the lease of two office buildings in houston  texas 
b assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal  allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases  but limited to the amount recorded as of september  actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors  including amounts required by local laws and regulations  and other funding requirements 
c assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal  allowing for certain growth 
due to the nonqualified nature of the plans  and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service  the payments included in the schedule were limited to the amount recorded as of september  d represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of september  backlog the following table summarizes our backlog at september    and in millions technical professional services field services total 
table of contents because the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as the contracts are awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time  and many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years  we evaluate our backlog on a year over year basis  rather than on a sequential  quarter over quarter basis 
our backlog at september  increased by billion  or  to billion from billion at september  the increase in backlog during fiscal was attributable primarily to new awards from clients operating in the upstream oil gas  and downstream energy and refining industries 
in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client 
however  we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts 
in a situation where a client terminates a contract  we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and  in certain instances  we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs 
while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog  our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 
total backlog at september  included approximately billion  or of total backlog  relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies 
this compares to approximately billion  or of total backlog  and billion  or of total backlog  of us federal backlog at september  and  respectively 
most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year 
in general  these contracts must be funded annually ie  the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency  and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 
subject to the factors discussed in item a risk factors  above  we estimate that approximately billion  or  of total backlog at september  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 
effects of inflation refer to item a risk factors  above 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations 
at september   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  and million of available capacity under our million unsecured  revolving credit facility discussed below 
during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million  to million 
this compares to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million during fiscal  and an increase of million during fiscal during fiscal  we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities of million 
additionally  we experienced a million increase resulting from changes in exchange rates during fiscal these inflows were offset in part by net cash outflows from investing activities and financing activities of million and million respectively 
our operations provided net cash of million during fiscal this compares to net cash inflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in net earnings  a million increase relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts  and increases in certain non cash items including an increase of million in depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and improvements  and a million increase in stock based compensation 
these increases in cash flows from operations were offset in part by the effects of a million change in deferred income taxes  a million change in the excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation  and a million decrease in amortization of intangible assets 

table of contents we used million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal this compares to net cash outflow of million and million during fiscal and respectively 
the million increase in cash used for investing activities as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an additional million of cash used for acquisitions of businesses 
also contributing to the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was an additional million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment  and a million increase in miscellaneous  non current assets 
we used million of cash for acquisitions of businesses during fiscal included in this amount is cash used to complete the acquisitions of edwards kelcey  wh linder associates  inc  and john f 
brown 
also included in this amount is cash used to acquire all of the minority interest of jacobs engineering india pvt 
ltd 
our financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of million during fiscal this compares to net cash inflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a more aggressive strategy in fiscal of paying down debt which resulted in an additional use of cash of million in fiscal as compared to last year 
also contributing to the increase in cash used for financing activities was a million change in other deferred liability accounts relating primarily to accrued pension liabilities 
these uses of cash were off set in part by a million increase in the excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation  and a million increase in cash from issuances of common stock through our stock option and stock purchase plans 
we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at september   compared to million at september  our consolidated working capital position at september  was billion  compared to million at september  we have a long term  unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to million of debt capacity  under which only million was utilized at september  in the form of direct borrowings 
we believe that the capacity  terms and conditions of our long term revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 
new accounting pronouncements in addition to sfas and fin discussed above  readers of this md a should be aware of the following new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fair value measurements 
sfas provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
sfas is effective for the company s fiscal year  although early adoption is permitted 
the company is currently assessing the potential effect of sfas on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading  speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk 
in the normal course of business  our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our only source for long term credit is a million syndicated revolving credit facility 
the total amount outstanding under this facility at september  was million 
this agreement expires in may  and provides for both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings 
our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to lower our overall 
table of contents borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we continuously monitor changes in interest rates  and use cash provided from operations to re pay our borrowings as quickly as possible 
furthermore  the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency  we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 
in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies  we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accounting for our derivative contracts 
at september   we had the following derivative contracts outstanding usd refers to us dollar  gbp  the british pound  bhd  the bahraini dinar hedge instrument notional amount rate settlement year euro put option  usd bahraini dinar forward bhd  gbp euro put option  gbp british pound forward  bhd concurrent with the acquisition of the babtie group  we entered into a forward contract with a large  us bank 
the purpose of the contract is to hedge the company s exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on a million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries 
based on the terms of the contract  we believe the effect of the loan on future earnings at september  should be limited to million of expense 
at september   the notional amount of the contract was million 
it provides for an average exchange rate of gbp to usd  and terminates in fiscal this derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the provisions of sfas
