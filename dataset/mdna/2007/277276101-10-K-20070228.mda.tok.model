item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview eastgroup s goal is to maximize shareholder value by being the leading provider in its markets of functional  flexible  and quality business distribution space for location sensitive tenants primarily in the  to  square foot range 
the company develops  acquires and operates distribution facilities  the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply constrained submarkets in major sunbelt regions 
the company s core markets are in the states of florida  texas  arizona and california 
the company s primary revenue is rental income  as such  eastgroup s greatest challenge is leasing space 
during  leases on  square feet of eastgroup s total square footage of  expired  and the company was successful in renewing or re leasing of that total 
in addition  eastgroup leased  square feet of other vacant space during the year 
during  average rental rates on new and renewal leases increased by 
eastgroup s total leased percentage increased to at december  from at december  leases scheduled to expire in were of the portfolio on a square foot basis at december   and this figure was reduced to as of february  property net operating income from same properties increased for as compared to the fourth quarter of was eastgroup s fourteenth consecutive quarter of positive same property comparisons 
the company generates new sources of leasing revenue through its acquisition and development programs 
during  eastgroup purchased acres of land for development in four markets and one property  square feet in four buildings in charlotte  north carolina for a total of approximately million 
charlotte is a new market for eastgroup and is the third new market for the company over the past three years 
in january  eastgroup purchased three additional buildings  square feet in charlotte for million and a  square foot building in dallas for million and  in february  the company purchased two buildings  square feet in san antonio for million 
eastgroup continues to see targeted development as a major contributor to the company s growth 
the company mitigates risks associated with development through a board approved maximum level of land held for development and by adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity 
during  the company transferred nine properties  square feet with aggregate costs of million at the date of transfer from development to real estate properties 
eight of the nine properties are leased and one is leased 
the company sold six properties five in memphis and one in michigan noncore markets and several parcels of land during for a net sales price of million  generating combined gains of million  of which approximately  was deferred 
these dispositions represented opportunities to recycle capital into acquisitions and development with greater upside potential 
the company primarily funds its acquisition and development programs through a million line of credit as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
as market conditions permit  eastgroup issues equity  including preferred equity  and or employs fixed rate  nonrecourse first mortgage debt to replace the short term bank borrowings 
in september  the company closed on the sale of  shares of its common stock 
the net proceeds from the offering of the shares were approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses 
eastgroup used the proceeds to repay borrowings under its credit facilities 
in august  the company closed on a million  nonrecourse first mortgage loan secured by properties containing  square feet 
the loan has a fixed interest rate of  a ten year term and an amortization schedule of years 
the proceeds of the note were used to repay the maturing mortgages on these properties of million and to reduce floating rate bank borrowings 
in october  the company closed on a million  nonrecourse first mortgage loan secured by properties containing  square feet 
the loan has a fixed interest rate of  a ten year term and an amortization schedule of years 
the proceeds of the note were used to repay a maturing million mortgage and to reduce floating rate bank borrowings 
tower automotive  inc tower filed for chapter reorganization in early tower  which leases  square feet from eastgroup under a lease expiring in december  is current with their rental payments to eastgroup through february eastgroup is obligated under a recourse mortgage loan on the property for  as of december  property net operating income for was  for the property occupied by tower 
rental income due for is  with estimated property net operating income for of  eastgroup has one reportable segment industrial properties 
these properties are primarily located in major sunbelt regions of the united states  have similar economic characteristics and also meet the other criteria that permit the properties to be aggregated into one reportable segment 
the company s chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions property net operating income pnoi  defined as income from real estate operations less property operating expenses before interest expense and depreciation and amortization  and funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo  defined as net income loss computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company calculates ffo based on nareit s definition 
pnoi is a supplemental industry reporting measurement used to evaluate the performance of the company s real estate investments 
the company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry s calculation of pnoi provides a supplemental indicator of the property s performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
pnoi as calculated by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other reits 
the major factors that influence pnoi are occupancy levels  acquisitions and sales  development properties that achieve stabilized operations  rental rate increases or decreases  and the recoverability of operating expenses 
the company s success depends largely upon its ability to lease space and to recover from tenants the operating costs associated with those leases 
real estate income is comprised of rental income  pass through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees 
property operating expenses are comprised of property taxes  insurance  utilities  repair and maintenance expenses  management fees  other operating costs and bad debt expense 
generally  the company s most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance 
tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable  modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable  or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable gross leases represent only a small portion of the company s total leases 
increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases 
modified gross leases often include base year amounts and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable 
the company s exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recovered 
the company believes ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity real estate investment trusts 
the company believes that excluding depreciation and amortization in the calculation of ffo is appropriate since real estate values have historically increased or decreased based on market conditions 
ffo is not considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance  nor is it a measure of the company s liquidity or indicative of funds available to provide for the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the company s key drivers affecting ffo are changes in pnoi as discussed above  interest rates  the amount of leverage the company employs and general and administrative expense 
the following table presents the three fiscal years reconciliations of pnoi and ffo available to common stockholders to net income

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the company 
real estate properties the company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
the allocation to tangible assets land  building and improvements is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in other assets and other liabilities  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
during the industrial development stage  costs associated with development ie  land  construction costs  interest expense during construction and lease up  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs associated with development are aggregated into the total capitalization of the property 
included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs primarily personnel costs that are deemed directly or indirectly related to such development activities 
the company reviews its real estate investments for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if any real estate investment is considered permanently impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
real estate assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the evaluation of real estate investments involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
currently  the company s management is not aware of any impairment issues nor has it experienced any significant impairment issues in recent years 
in the event of impairment  the property s basis would be reduced and the impairment would be recognized as a current period charge in the income statement 
valuation of receivables the company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company performs credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates outstanding receivables and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management specifically analyzes aged receivables  customer credit worthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for its outstanding receivables for the periods presented 
in the event that the allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient for an account that is subsequently written off  additional bad debt expense would be recognized as a current period charge in the income statement 
tax status eastgroup  a maryland corporation  has qualified as a real estate investment trust under sections of the internal revenue code and intends to continue to qualify as such 
to maintain its status as a reit  the company is required to distribute at least of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders 
the company has the option of i reinvesting the sales price of properties sold through tax deferred exchanges  allowing for a deferral of capital gains on the sale  ii paying out capital gains to the stockholders with no tax to the company  or iii treating the capital gains as having been distributed to the stockholders  paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to the stockholders 
the company distributed all of its  and taxable income to its stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was necessary
