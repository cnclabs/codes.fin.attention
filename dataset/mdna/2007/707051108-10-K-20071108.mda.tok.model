item business description of business penford corporation which  together with its subsidiary companies  is referred to herein as penford or the company is a north american and australian developer  manufacturer and marketer of specialty natural based ingredient systems for many industrial and food applications 
the company s strategically located manufacturing facilities in the united states  australia and new zealand provide it with broad geographic coverage of its target markets 
penford is a washington corporation originally incorporated in september the company commenced operations as a publicly traded company on march  penford operates in three business segments  each utilizing its carbohydrate chemistry expertise to develop starch based ingredients for value added applications in several markets that improve the quality and performance 
table of contents of customers products  including papermaking and food products 
the first two  industrial ingredients and food ingredients  are broad categories of end market users  primarily served by the company s united states operations 
the third segment consists of geographically separate operations in australia and new zealand 
the australian and new zealand operations are engaged primarily in the food ingredients business 
financial information about penford s segments and geographic areas is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has extensive research and development capabilities  which are used in understanding the complex chemistry of carbohydrate based materials and in developing applications to address customer needs 
penford s three business segments are industrial ingredients north america  which in fiscal generated approximately of penford s revenue  is a supplier of chemically modified specialty starches to the paper and packaging industries 
through a commitment to research and development  industrial ingredients develops customized product applications that help its customers realize improved manufacturing efficiencies and advancements in product performance 
industrial ingredients has specialty processing capabilities for a variety of modified starches 
specialty products for industrial applications are designed to improve the strength and performance of customers products and efficiencies in the manufacture of coated and uncoated paper and paper packaging products 
these starches are principally ethylated chemically modified with ethylene oxide  oxidized treated with sodium hypochlorite and cationic carrying a positive electrical charge 
ethylated and oxidized starches are used in coatings and as binders  providing strength and printability to fine white  magazine and catalog paper 
cationic and other liquid starches are generally used in the paper forming process in paper production  providing strong bonding of paper fibers and other ingredients 
industrial ingredients products are a cost effective alternative to synthetic  petroleum based ingredients 
food ingredients north america  which in fiscal generated approximately of penford s revenue  is a developer and manufacturer of specialty starches and dextrins to the food manufacturing and food service industries 
its expertise is in leveraging the inherent characteristics from potato  corn  tapioca and rice to help improve its customers product performance 
food ingredients is the only north american manufacturer of modified food grade potato starch 
food ingredients specialty starches produced for food applications are used in coatings to provide crispness  improved taste and texture  and increased product life for products such as french fries sold in quick service restaurants 
food grade starch products are also used as moisture binders to reduce fat levels  modify texture and improve color and consistency in a variety of foods such as canned products  sauces  whole and processed meats  dry powdered mixes and other food and bakery products 
australia new zealand operations generated approximately of penford s revenue in fiscal and the company believes it is the sole domestic producer of value added modified maize starches and various starch derived products for the food  paper and mining industries in australia and new zealand 
the australia new zealand segment develops  manufactures and markets ingredient systems  including specialty starches and sweeteners for food and industrial applications 
in both australia and new zealand  modified starch competition is generally from imports as there is only one other domestic producer 
this segment s flexible manufacturing capabilities allow the company to manufacture products to customer specifications and to quickly respond to customers changing needs 
in june  the company announced plans to invest million for up to million gallons of ethanol production capacity per year at its cedar rapids  iowa facility 
in october  penford refinanced its credit facility and obtained a million capital expansion loan commitment maturing december to finance construction of the ethanol plant 
the designed capacity has been expanded to million gallons with construction cost estimates maintained at to per gallon 
contracts valued at million have been awarded for this project as of the end of october penford has much of the infrastructure within the cedar rapids plant to manufacture ethanol cost effectively  with sufficient grain handling  separation processes  utilities and logistic capabilities 
the factory is centrally located near rail and ground transport arteries and the ethanol facility will occupy available space within the existing site footprint 
once complete  this enhancement of the company s bio refining capabilities will give management the ability to select from multiple output choices to capitalize on changing industry conditions and selling opportunities 
this increased flexibility will allow the company to direct production towards the most 
table of contents attractive mix of strategic and financial opportunities 
additionally  by improving production capacity and adding fermentation capability  penford expects to be better positioned to participate in emerging bio processing trends and technologies that represent potential platforms for future growth 
raw materials corn penford s north american corn wet milling plant is located in cedar rapids  iowa  the middle of the us corn belt 
accordingly  the plant has truck delivered corn available throughout the year from a number of suppliers at prices consistent with those available in the major us grain markets 
penford australia s corn wet milling facilities in lane cove  australia  and auckland  new zealand are sourced through truck delivered corn at contracted prices with regional independent farmers and merchants 
the corn sourced in australia and new zealand is normally contracted prior to harvest march june 
corn used in australia is purchased and stored for use in both the current and following year 
the corn sourced in new zealand is purchased in advance for future delivery 
corn is also purchased from australia as necessary to supplement the corn sourced and processed in new zealand 
potato starch the company s facilities in idaho falls  idaho  richland  washington  and plover  wisconsin use starch recovered as by products from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture modified potato starches 
the company enters into contracts typically having durations of one to five years with potato processors in the united states  canada and mexico to acquire potato based raw materials 
wheat products penford australia s tamworth facility uses wheat flour as the primary raw material for the production of its wheat products  including wheat starch  wheat gluten and glucose syrup 
the company is currently negotiating with various suppliers for the supply of wheat flour subsequent to the expiration of its current supply contract at the end of calendar chemicals the primary chemicals used in the manufacturing processes are readily available commodity chemicals 
the prices for these chemicals are subject to price fluctuations due to market conditions 
natural gas the primary energy source for most of penford s plants is natural gas 
penford contracts its natural gas supply with regional suppliers  generally under short term supply agreements  and at times uses futures contracts to hedge the price of natural gas in north america 
corn  potato starch  wheat flour  chemicals and natural gas are not currently subject to availability constraints  although drought conditions in australia have periodically affected the prices of corn and wheat in that area and strong demand has substantially increased the prices of natural gas  chemicals and agricultural raw materials 
current forecasts for wheat production in australia indicate that the existing drought will affect the future price for that raw material 
penford s current potato starch requirements constitute a material portion of the available north american supply 
penford estimates that it purchases approximately of the recovered potato starch in north america 
it is possible that  in the long term  continued growth in demand for potato starch based ingredients and new product development could result in capacity constraints 
over half of the company s manufacturing costs consists of the costs of corn  potato starch  wheat flour  chemicals and natural gas 
the remaining portion consists of the costs of labor  distribution  depreciation and maintenance of manufacturing plant and equipment  and other utilities 
the prices of raw materials may fluctuate  and increases in prices may affect penford s business adversely 
to mitigate this risk  penford hedges a portion of corn and gas purchases with futures and options contracts in the us and enters into short term supply agreements for other production requirements in all locations 
research and development penford s research and development efforts cover a range of projects including technical service work focused on specific customer support projects which require coordination with customers research efforts to develop innovative solutions to specific customer requirements 
these projects are supplemented with longer term  new product development and commercialization initiatives 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 

table of contents at the end of fiscal  penford had scientists  including seven with phd s with expert knowledge of carbohydrate characteristics and chemistry 
patents  trademarks and tradenames penford owns a number of patents  trademarks and tradenames 
penford has approximately current patents and pending patent applications  most of which are related to technologies in french fry coatings  coatings for the paper industry and animal and human nutrition 
penford s issued patents expire at various times between and the annual cost to renew all of the company s patents is approximately million 
however  most of penford s products are currently made with technology that is broadly available to companies that have the same level of scientific expertise and production capabilities as penford 
specialty starch ingredient brand names for industrial applications include  among others  penford gums  pensize binders  penflex sizing agent  topcat cationic additive and the apollo starch series 
product brand names for food ingredient applications include penbind  pencling  penplus  cantab  maps tm  mazaca tm and fieldcleer tm 
quarterly fluctuations penford s revenues and operating results vary from quarter to quarter 
in particular  the company experiences seasonality in its australian operations 
the company has lower sales volumes and gross margins in australia and new zealand s summer months  which occur during penford s second fiscal quarter 
this seasonal decline is caused by the closure of some customers plants for public holidays and maintenance during this period 
decreased consumption of some foods which use the company s products  such as packaged bread  also contributes to this seasonal trend 
sales volumes of the food ingredients north america products used in french fry coatings are also generally lower during penford s second fiscal quarter due to decreased consumption of french fries during the post holiday season 
the cost of natural gas in north america is generally higher in the winter months than the summer months 
working capital the company s growth is funded through a combination of cash flows from operations and short and long term borrowings 
see the discussion in liquidity and capital resources under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations in item penford generally carries a one to day supply of materials required for production  depending on the lead time for specific items 
penford manufactures finished goods to customer orders or anticipated demand 
the company is therefore able to carry less than a day supply of most products 
terms for trade receivables and trade payables are standard for the industry and region and generally do not exceed day terms except for trade receivables for export sales 
environmental matters penford s operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
in the united states  these laws and regulations include the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the epa oil pollution control act  the occupational safety and health administration s hazardous materials regulations  the toxic substances control act  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act  and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act

no unusual expenditures for environmental facilities and programs are anticipated in fiscal principal customers penford sells to a variety of customers and has several relatively large customers in each business segment 
none of the company s customers constituted of sales in fiscal years and however  for fiscal  the company s largest customer  domtar  inc  represented approximately of the company s consolidated net sales 
domtar  inc is a customer of the company s industrial ingredients north america business 
competition in its primary markets  penford competes directly with approximately five other companies that manufacture specialty starches for the papermaking industry and approximately six other companies that manufacture specialty food ingredients 
penford competes indirectly with a larger number of companies that provide synthetic and natural based ingredients to industrial and food customers 
some of these competitors are larger companies  and have greater financial and technical resources than penford 
application expertise  quality and service are the major competitive advantages for penford 
employees at august   penford had total employees 
in north america  penford had employees  of which approximately are members of a trade union 
the collective bargaining agreement covering the cedar rapids based manufacturing workforce expires in august penford australia had employees  of which are members of trade unions in australia and new zealand 
the union contracts for the tamworth  australia  and the new zealand facilities have expiration dates of september and february  respectively 
the lane cove  australia  union agreement expires in december and is currently being negotiated 
there is no assurance that the company will successfully renegotiate this agreement before expiration or at all 
sales and distribution sales are generated using a combination of direct sales and distributor agreements 
in many cases  penford supports its sales efforts with technical and advisory assistance to customers 
penford generally ships its products upon receipt of purchase orders from its customers and  consequently  backlog is not significant 
customers for industrial corn based starch ingredients purchase products through fixed price contracts or formula priced contracts for periods covering three months to two years or on a spot basis 
in fiscal  approximately of these sales were under fixed price contracts  and the remaining of the sales were under formula priced contracts or sold on a spot basis 
since penford s customers are generally other manufacturers and processors  most of the company s products are distributed via rail or truck to customer facilities in bulk  except in australia and new zealand where most dry product is packaged in kg bags 

table of contents foreign operations and export sales penford expanded into foreign markets with its acquisition of penford australia in september penford australia is the primary producer of corn starch products in australia and new zealand 
penford australia manufactures products used to enhance the quality and performance of packaged food products  generally through providing the texture and viscosity required by its customers for products such as sauces and gravies 
penford australia s starch products are also used in industrial applications including mining  paper  corrugating and building materials 
the company s operations in australia and new zealand include three manufacturing facilities for processing specialty corn starches and wheat related products 
competition is mainly from imported products  except in wheat flour based starches where there is one other producer in australia 
export sales from penford s businesses in the us and australia new zealand accounted for approximately  and of total sales in fiscal  and  respectively

item a risk factors factors that may affect business and future results 
the availability and cost of agricultural products penford purchases are vulnerable to weather and other factors beyond its control 
the company s ability to pass through cost increases for these products is limited by worldwide competition and other factors 
in fiscal  approximately of penford s manufacturing costs were the costs of corn  wheat flour and potato starch 
weather conditions  plantings  government programs and policies  and energy costs and global 
table of contents supply  among other things  have historically caused volatility in the supply and prices of these agricultural products 
for example  in and  growing regions in australia experienced significant droughts  reducing crop yields and increasing acquisition costs for grain raw materials 
due to local and or international competition  particularly in the australia new zealand operations  the company may not be able to pass through the increases in the cost of agricultural raw materials to its customers 
to manage price volatility in the commodity markets  the company may purchase inventory in advance or enter into exchange traded futures or options contracts 
despite these hedging activities  the company may not be successful in limiting its exposure to market fluctuations in the cost of agricultural raw materials 
increases in the cost of corn  wheat flour and potato starch due to weather conditions or other factors beyond penford s control and that cannot be passed through to customers will reduce penford s future profitability 
increases in energy and chemical costs may reduce penford s profitability 
energy and chemicals comprised approximately and  respectively  of the cost of manufacturing the company s products in fiscal penford uses natural gas extensively in its industrial ingredients business to dry starch products  and  to a lesser extent  in the other business segments 
the company uses chemicals in all of the businesses to modify starch for specific product applications and customer requirements 
the prices of these inputs to the manufacturing process fluctuate based on anticipated changes in supply and demand  weather and the prices of alternative fuels  including petroleum 
the company may use short term purchase contracts or exchange traded futures or option contracts to reduce the price volatility of natural gas  however  these strategies are not available for the chemicals the company purchases 
if the company is unable to pass on increases in energy and chemical costs to its customers  margins and profitability would be adversely affected 
the loss of a major customer could have an adverse effect on penford s results of operations 
in fiscal and  none of the company s customers constituted more than of sales 
however  in fiscal  the company s largest customer  domtar  inc  represented approximately of consolidated net sales and sales to the top ten customers represented of consolidated net sales 
generally  the company does not have multi year sales agreements with its customers 
instead  many customers place orders on an as needed basis and generally can change their suppliers without penalty 
if penford lost one or more major customers  or if one or more major customers significantly reduced its orders  sales and results of operations would be adversely affected 
the company is substantially dependent on its manufacturing facilities  any operational disruption could result in a reduction of the company s sales volumes and could cause it to incur substantial losses 
penford s revenues are and will continue to be derived from the sale of starch based ingredients that the company s manufactures at its facilities 
the company s operations may be subject to significant interruption if any of its facilities experiences a major accident or is damaged by severe weather or other natural disasters 
in addition  the company s operations may be subject to labor disruptions and unscheduled downtime  or other operational hazards inherent in the industry  such as equipment failures  fires  explosions  abnormal pressures  blowouts  pipeline ruptures  transportation accidents and natural disasters 
some of these operational hazards may cause personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
the company s insurance may not be adequate to fully cover the potential operational hazards described above or that it will be able to renew this insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the agreements governing the company s debt contain various covenants that limit its ability to take certain actions and also require the company to meet financial maintenance tests  and penford s failure to comply with any of the debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the agreements governing penford s outstanding debt contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  limit its ability to incur additional debt or liens  
table of contents consolidate or merge with any person or transfer or sell all or substantially all of its assets  make investments or acquisitions  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  enter into transactions with affiliates  and create dividend or other payment restrictions with respect to subsidiaries 
in addition  the company s revolving credit facility requires it to comply with specific financial ratios and tests  under which it is required to achieve specific financial and operating results 
events beyond the company s control may affect its ability to comply with these provisions 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the company s revolving credit facility 
in the event of any default that is not cured or waived  the company s lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with accrued interest thereon  due and payable  which could permit acceleration of other debt 
if any of the company s debt is accelerated  there is no assurance that the company would have sufficient assets to repay that debt or that it would be able to refinance that debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
changes in interest rates may affect penford s profitability 
although the company has fixed the interest rates on a significant portion of its outstanding debt through interest rate swaps  as of august   approximately million of its outstanding debt  including amounts outstanding under the australian grain inventory financing facility  was subject to variable interest rates which move in direct relation to the united states or australian london interbank offered rate libor  the australian bank bill rate bbsy  or the prime rate in the united states  depending on the selection of borrowing options 
any significant changes in these interest rates would materially affect the company s profitability by increasing or decreasing its borrowing costs 
unanticipated changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect penford s profitability 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states  australia and new zealand 
the company s effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets  which are predominantly in the united states  is dependent on the company s ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
although the company believes it has complied with all applicable income tax laws  there is no assurance that a tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law or that any additional taxes imposed as a result of tax audits will not have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
fluctuations in the relative value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect penford s revenues and profitability 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates 
the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies has been generally in decline in recent years 
in fiscal year  approximately of the company s revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company s revenues and profitability may be adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies 
the company may not be able to implement ethanol production as planned or at all 
even if the company successfully implements ethanol production  its ethanol facility may not be profitable 
the company s ability to implement ethanol production as planned is subject to uncertainty 
the company has secured million of financing for this project which it believes is adequate for the project s completion  however  the company could face financial risks if this amount of financing is not sufficient to complete the construction of 
table of contents the ethanol facility 
penford may be adversely affected by environmental  health and safety laws  regulations and liabilities in implementing ethanol production  which could increase its costs 
changes in the markets for ethanol  including oversupply in ethanol capacity  and or legislation and regulations could materially and adversely affect ethanol demand 
there is no assurance that sufficient demand for ethanol will develop to permit profitable operation of the ethanol production facility 
penford s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other contingencies 
the company faces risks arising from litigation matters in which various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities  such as final adverse judgments  significant settlements or changes in applicable law 
a future adverse outcome  ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
penford has foreign operations  which exposes it to the risks of doing business abroad 
approximately of the company s revenues are derived from its operations in australia and new zealand 
these foreign operations subject the company to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside the united states  including the following currency fluctuations  transportation delays and interruptions  political  social and economic instability and disruptions  government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions  the imposition of duties  tariffs and other trade barriers  import and export controls  labor unrest and changing regulatory environments  limitations on the company s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although the company s operations have not been materially affected by any such factors to date  no assurance can be given that its operations may not be adversely affected in the future 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on the company s operations in the future by reducing the demand for its products  decreasing the prices at which the company can sell its products or otherwise having an adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
penford depends on its senior management team  the loss of any member could adversely affect its operations 
penford s success depends on the management and leadership skills of its senior management team 
the loss of any of these individuals  particularly thomas d 
malkoski  the company s president and chief executive officer  or steven o 
cordier  the company s chief financial officer  or the company s inability to attract  retain and maintain additional personnel  could prevent it from fully implementing its business strategy 
there is no assurance that it will be able to retain its existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed 
penford is subject to stringent environmental and health and safety laws  which may require it to incur substantial compliance and remediation costs  thereby reducing profits 
penford is subject to many federal  state  local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  particularly with respect to the use  handling  treatment  storage  discharge and disposal of substances and hazardous wastes used or generated in its manufacturing processes 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in the company s business 
penford has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant 
table of contents expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
the company s failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions 
the company may be required to incur costs relating to the investigation or remediation of property  including property where it has disposed of its waste  and for addressing environmental conditions 
some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners  operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination 
consequently  there is no assurance that existing or future circumstances  the development of new facts or the failure of third parties to address contamination at current or former facilities or properties will not require significant expenditures by the company 
the company expects to continue to be subject to increasingly stringent environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
it is difficult to predict the future interpretation and development of environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or their impact on the company s future earnings and operations 
the company anticipates that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
any increase in these costs  or unanticipated liabilities arising  for example  out of discovery of previously unknown conditions or more aggressive enforcement actions  could adversely affect the company s results of operations  and there is no assurance that they will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
penford s unionized workforce could cause interruptions in the company s provision of services 
as of august   approximately of the company s north american employees  and of the employees of penford australia  were members of trade unions 
although the company s relations with unions are stable  there is no assurance that the company will not experience work disruptions or stoppages in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations and adversely affect its relationships with its customers 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  penford experienced a union strike at its cedar rapids manufacturing facility 
the company incurred million and million in additional production costs for and  respectively  in connection with the strike 
additionally  the company s non union workforce could be disrupted by union organizing activities and similar actions

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the process of preparing financial statements requires management to 
table of contents make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of the current facts and circumstances 
management believes that its estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available at the time this report was prepared 
to the extent there are material differences between estimates  judgments and assumptions and the actual results  the financial statements will be affected 
management has reviewed the accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the financial statements and that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments include the following evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable hedging activities benefit plans valuation of goodwill self insurance program income taxes stock based compensation a description of each of these follows evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable management makes judgments about the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for the portion of receivables that the company may not be able to collect 
penford estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience  known troubled accounts  industry trends  economic conditions  how recently payments have been received  and ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
if the estimates do not reflect the company s future ability to collect outstanding invoices  penford may experience losses in excess of the reserves established 
at august   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million 
hedging activities penford uses derivative instruments  primarily futures contracts  to reduce exposure to price fluctuations of commodities used in the manufacturing processes in the united states 
penford has elected to designate these activities as hedges 
this election allows the company to defer gains and losses on those derivative instruments until the underlying commodity is used in the production process 
to reduce exposure to variable short term interest rates  penford uses interest rate swap agreements 
the requirements for the designation of hedges are very complex  and require judgments and analyses to qualify as hedges as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

these judgments and analyses include an assessment that the derivative instruments used are effective hedges of the underlying risks 
if the company were to fail to meet the requirements of sfas no 
 or if these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges  the company would be required to mark these contracts to market at each reporting date 
penford had deferred gains losses  net of tax  of million and million at august  and  respectively  which are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in both years 
see note and to the consolidated financial statements 
benefit plans penford has defined benefit plans for its us employees providing retirement benefits and coverage for retiree health care 
qualified third party actuaries assist management in determining the expense and funded status of these 
table of contents employee benefit plans 
management makes several estimates and assumptions in order to measure the expense and funded status  including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities  rates of return on plan assets  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  and increases in the cost of medical care 
the company makes judgments about these assumptions based on historical investment results and experience as well as available historical market data and trends 
however  if these assumptions are wrong  it could materially affect the amounts reported in the company s future results of operations 
disclosure about these estimates and assumptions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
see defined benefit plans below 
valuation of goodwill penford is required to assess  on an annual basis  whether the value of goodwill reported on the balance sheet has been impaired  or more often if conditions exist that indicate that there might be an impairment 
these assessments require extensive and subjective judgments to assess the fair value of goodwill 
while the company engages qualified valuation experts to assist in this process  their work is based on the company s estimates of future operating results and allocation of goodwill to the business units 
if future operating results differ materially from the estimates  the value of goodwill could be adversely impacted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
self insurance program the company maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation and group health liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future losses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and changes that could occur in actuarial assumptions 
the financial results of the company could be significantly affected if future claims and assumptions differ from those used in determining these liabilities 
income taxes the determination of the company s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws
