item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as ball or the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview ball corporation is one of the world s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage  food and household products industries 
our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world 
we also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 
we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage and food companies and producers of household products with which we have developed long term customer relationships 
this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts 
while we have diversified our customer base  we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america  europe  the people s republic of china prc and argentina  as do our equity joint ventures in brazil  the us and the prc 
we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers 
because of our customer and supplier concentration  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier  although our long term relationships and contracts mitigate these risks 
in the rigid packaging industry  sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs  developing new products  volume expansion and increasing pricing 
in we expect to complete a project to upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities  a project that is expected to result in productivity gains and cost reductions beginning in while the us and canadian beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature  the european  prc and brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow 
we are capitalizing on this growth by continuing to reconfigure some of our european can manufacturing lines and by having constructed a new beverage can manufacturing plant in belgrade  serbia  in to better position the company in the european market  the capacity from the fire damaged hassloch  germany  plant will be replaced with a mix of steel beverage can manufacturing capacity in the hassloch plant and aluminum beverage can manufacturing capacity in the company s hermsdorf  germany  plant 
as part of our packaging strategy  we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers 
these innovations include new shapes  sizes  opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging 
this packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage  food and household products customers 
ball s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments  as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk within item a of this report 
the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 
it is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities  or changes in agency budgets  could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance 
we recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost to cost  percentage of completion method of accounting 
our present contract mix consists of approximately two thirds cost type contracts  which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and or earned profit component  and approximately one third fixed price contracts 
we include time and material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates 
page of throughout the period of contract performance  we regularly reevaluate and  if necessary  revise our estimates of total contract revenue  total contract cost and progress toward completion 
because of contract payment schedules  limitations on funding and other contract terms  our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 
management uses various measures to evaluate company performance 
the primary financial metric we use is economic valued added operating earnings  as defined by the company  less a charge for net operating assets employed 
our goal is to increase economic valued added on an annual basis 
other financial metrics we use are earnings before interest and taxes ebit  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  diluted earnings per share  operating cash flow and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures 
these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods 
nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production spoilage rates  quality control figures  safety statistics and production and shipment volumes 
additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization  award and incentive fees realized  proposal win rates and backlog including awarded  contracted and funded backlog 
we recognize that attracting and retaining quality employees is essential to the success of ball and  because of this  we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the company s common stock as part of a diversified portfolio 
for most management employees  a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive  dependent upon economic value added operating performance 
for more senior positions  more compensation is at risk 
through our employee stock purchase plan and k plan  which matches employee contributions with ball common stock  employees  regardless of organizational level  have opportunities to own ball shares 
recent developments on march   ball acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of us can corporation us can for consideration of  common shares of ball corporation valued at per share for a total of million 
in connection with the acquisition  ball refinanced million of us can debt  including million of bond redemption premiums and fees  and over the next several years expects to realize approximately million for acquired net operating tax loss carryforwards 
as a result of this acquisition  ball became the largest manufacturer of aerosol cans in north america and now manufactures aerosol cans  paint cans  plastic containers and custom and specialty cans in plants in the us and aerosol cans in two plants in argentina 
in october the company announced it would close an acquired plant in alliance  ohio 
the acquired operations have annual sales of approximately million 
the acquired business forms part of ball s metal food and household products packaging  americas  segment and its results have been included since the date of acquisition 
effective january   responsibility for the us can plastics business was transferred to our plastic packaging  americas  segment 
on march   ball acquired north american plastic bottle container assets from alcan packaging alcan for million cash 
this acquisition strengthens the company s plastic container business and complements its food container business 
the acquired assets included two plastic container manufacturing plants in the us and one in canada  as well as certain manufacturing equipment and other assets from other alcan facilities 
the acquired business primarily manufactures and sells barrier polypropylene plastic bottles used in food packaging and  to a lesser extent  barrier pet plastic bottles used for beverages and food 
the acquired operations have annual sales of approximately million 
the operations form part of ball s plastic packaging  americas  segment and their results have been included since the date of acquisition 
the company refinanced us can s debt at the time of the acquisition with significantly lower interest rates through the issuance by ball corporation of million of new senior notes and a million increase in bank debt under the senior credit facilities put in place in the fourth quarter of the proceeds of these financings were also used to acquire the alcan operations and to reduce seasonal working capital debt 
on april   a fire in the metal beverage can plant in hassloch  germany  damaged the majority of the building and machinery and equipment 
in november the company reached final agreement with the insurance carrier on property insurance and business interruption recoveries 
additional details are available in the consolidated sales and earnings section for the metal beverage packaging  europe asia segment 
page of in june the company s us defined benefit plans for salaried employees were amended to provide more flexibility for future pension benefits by allowing portability and changing the benefit to a career average pay scheme that grows by a prescribed amount annually 
the annual accounting expense under the amended plans will be lower and more predictable 
the amendments  which were effective january   reduced pension expense by approximately million 
we intend to reduce our current return on asset assumption for the us pension plans to percent for  based upon current market conditions and anticipated long term rate of return on plan assets  while increasing the discount rate assumption to percent 
based on these assumptions and the salaried plan design changes  us pension expense for is anticipated to increase million compared to  most of which will be included in cost of sales 
pension expense in europe and canada combined is expected to be slightly higher than the expense 
a reduction of the plan asset return assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in additional expense of approximately million while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in approximately million of additional expense 
additional information regarding the company s pension plans is provided in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
consolidated sales and earnings the company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines and geographic areas metal beverage packaging  americas  metal beverage packaging  europe asia  metal food and household products packaging  americas  plastic packaging  americas  and aerospace and technologies 
we also have investments in companies in the us  the prc and brazil  which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and  accordingly  those results are not included in segment sales or earnings 
we expect a strong first quarter in as elevated raw material inventories are reduced to more normal levels 
during the fourth quarter of  ball s management changed its method of inventory accounting for certain invnetories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method in the metal beverage  americas  and the metal food and household products packaging  americas  segments 
all periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted on a fifo basis 
in the third quarter of  the company changed its expense allocation method by allocating to each of the packaging segments stock based compensation expense previously included in corporate undistributed expenses 
the change did not have a significant impact on any segment for the current or prior years 
prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation of the segments and the change in expense allocation 
metal beverage packaging  americas the metal beverage packaging  americas  segment consists of operations located in the us  canada and puerto rico  which manufacture products used primarily in beverage packaging 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in 
sales were percent higher in than in due to more than percent higher beverage can shipments coupled with higher aluminum prices passed through to our customers 
the increased sales over were also driven by favorable weather in many parts of the us and canada  as well as the promotion of ounce can packages by beer and soft drink companies 
sales in were slightly higher than in as lower sales volumes were offset by the pass through of higher aluminum prices 
metal beverage container volumes in were percent below the previous year s levels as a result of poor weather in the first quarter  temporary volume reductions and general softness in the beer and carbonated soft drink markets 
based on publicly available information  we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately percent of total us and canadian shipments in we continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business  which includes cans of different shapes  diameters and fill volumes  and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions 
during the first quarter of  we completed the conversion of a line in our monticello  indiana  plant from ounce can manufacturing to a line capable of producing other sizes 
earnings in the segment were million in compared to million in and million in the third quarter of included a pretax charge of million million after tax related to a project to significantly upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities 
the charge included the write off of obsolete equipment spare parts and tooling  as well as employee termination costs 
over time  this capital project is expected to result in productivity improvements and reduced manufacturing page of costs 
we have installed and are operating three of eight production modules in this multi year project and the fourth and fifth modules are in the installation phase 
the project is expected to be completed in in connection with this project  the can end manufacturing operations at the reidsville  north carolina  plant were shut down during the fourth quarter of despite higher sales in  segment earnings growth was constrained by product mix and continued year over year cost growth  particularly higher energy  other direct material and freight costs  which were million more than in while contract price escalations have commenced for many of our customers  cost growth has continued to outpace price increases 
energy  freight and other direct material costs were million higher in than in  partially offset by efficiency gains  cost controls and lower selling  general and administrative costs in while pricing pressures continue on our raw materials  other direct materials  and freight and utility costs  we continue to work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes  as well as preserve our margins 
metal beverage packaging  europe asia the metal beverage packaging  europe asia  segment includes the production and sale of metal beverage container products manufactured and sold in europe and asia as well as plastic containers manufactured and sold in asia 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in 
ball packaging europe  which represents an estimated percent of the total european metal beverage container manufacturing capacity  has manufacturing plants located in germany  the united kingdom  france  the netherlands  poland and serbia 
due to strong demand  segment can shipments were more than percent higher in than in higher segment sales volumes were aided by favorable european weather and germany hosting the world cup soccer championship during june and july  as well as by continued growth in the china market 
segment sales  which grew percent in  also benefited from the strength of the euro 
segment sales were approximately percent higher in than in primarily as a result of an increase in sales volumes 
the slow return of the can to the german market  as a result of the mandatory deposit legislation previously reported on  is being more than offset by stronger demand elsewhere in europe  including southern and eastern europe 
we expect prc demand for aluminum beverage cans to grow in the coming years  as both multinational and chinese beverage fillers expand their markets 
the construction of a new beverage can plant in belgrade  serbia  was completed near the end of the second quarter of to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern europe 
the plant became fully operational during the third quarter of the serbian plant was constructed to accommodate a second can production line and a can end manufacturing module for future growth 
earnings in the segment were million in  million in and million in segment earnings in included a million property insurance gain related to a fire at the company s hassloch  germany  metal beverage can plant further details are provided in the recent developments section 
the third quarter of also included a gain of million related to the change in an estimated liability 
the fourth quarter of included a million gain primarily resulting from the final settlement of all tax obligations related to liquidated china operations for amounts less than originally estimated 
first quarter segment earnings included a million expense for the write off of the remaining carrying value of an equity investment in the prc 
earnings in included income of million related to the realization of proceeds on assets in the prc being in excess of amounts previously estimated  and costs of liquidation being less than anticipated in a prior year business consolidation charge 
segment earnings in were higher than in due to the property insurance gain  higher volumes  price recovery initiatives and effective manufacturing and selling  general and administrative cost controls  partially offset by higher raw material  freight and energy costs  and price cost compression in the prc 
higher material  energy and transportation costs  as well as second and third quarter start up costs related to a line conversion in the netherlands and the new serbia plant  had a negative effect on segment earnings compared to partially offsetting these higher costs were lower selling  general and administrative costs 
page of on april   a fire in the metal beverage can plant in hassloch  germany  damaged the majority of the building  machinery and equipment 
the property insurance proceeds recorded for the year ended december   which are based on replacement cost  were million million  of which million million was received in april  million million was received in october and the remainder of million million  which was recorded in other long term assets  was received in january a million million fixed asset write down was recorded to reflect the estimated impairment of the assets damaged as a result of the fire 
as a result  a gain of million million pretax was recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings to reflect the difference between the net book value of the impaired assets and the property insurance proceeds 
an additional million million  million million and million million were recorded in cost of sales in the second  third and fourth quarters  respectively  for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs  as well as million million to offset clean up costs 
an additional million of business interruption recoveries has been agreed upon with the insurance carrier and will be recognized in in june the company announced its intention to rebuild the hassloch plant with two steel lines and to add an aluminum line in its hermsdorf  germany  plant 
all three lines are expected to be operational during the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we acquired the minority interest in our two prc high density plastic joint ventures for million in cash 
during the fourth quarter of  sanshui jianlibao ftb packaging limited sanshui jfp  a percent owned prc joint venture  experienced a greater than customary seasonal production slowdown caused by cash flow difficulties 
in response  we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in respect of sanshui jfp s receivable from the joint venture partner for million  which was included in the consolidated statement of earnings as equity in results of affiliates 
information learned late in the first quarter of led the company to record expense of million to write off the remaining carrying value of this investment 
earnings of million and million in and  respectively  were recognized as prc restructuring activities that commenced in were completed  resulting in realization on assets in excess of amounts previously estimated  as well as costs incurred being less than estimated  including settlement of tax matters 
all costs and transactions related to the prc restructuring have been concluded 
additional details regarding business consolidation activities are available in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements included within item of this annual report 
metal food and household products packaging  americas the metal food and household products packaging  americas  segment consists of operations located in the us  canada and argentina 
with the acquisition of us can discussed in the recent developments section  the segment added to its metal food can manufacturing the production of aerosol cans  paint cans  certain plastic containers and custom and specialty cans 
segment sales in comprised percent of consolidated net sales percent in and were percent higher than sales 
the primary reason for the increase was the acquisition of us can 
the favorable impact on sales of the pass through of higher raw material costs was offset by lower third quarter food can volumes 
sales in were percent higher than in  reflecting higher prices from the pass through of higher raw material costs 
sales volumes were flat compared to levels including  in the first quarter of  the inclusion of a full quarter s results from our oakdale  california  facility  which was acquired in march during  and  we were able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases and surcharges levied by steel producers 
based on publicly available trade information  we estimate our shipments of more than billion steel food containers and billion aerosol containers to be approximately percent and percent of total us and canadian metal food container and steel aerosol container shipments  respectively 
segment earnings were million in compared to million in and million in the fourth quarter of included a pretax charge of million  primarily for the closure of a metal food can manufacturing plant in burlington  ontario  as part of the realignment of the segment following the us can acquisition discussed in more detail below 
the first six months of included a net pretax charge of million primarily related to the shut down of a metal food can manufacturing line in the whitby  ontario  plant 
page of the fourth quarter of included a pretax charge of million million after tax for pension  severance and other employee benefit costs related to a reduction in force in the burlington plant 
the second quarter of included a pretax charge of million million after tax for the closure of a three piece food can manufacturing plant in quebec 
the quebec plant was closed and ceased operations in the third quarter of and an agreement was reached to sell the land and building  which resulted in the second quarter charge being offset by a million gain million after tax in the fourth quarter of to adjust the plant to net realizable value 
higher sales volumes related to the us can acquisition helped improve segment earnings in the last nine months of  despite the negative impact of lower food can volumes attributable to the loss of a customer in late and a poor salmon harvest in additionally  segment earnings in were reduced by purchase accounting adjustments of million  which increased cost of sales due to inventory valuations associated with the acquired us can finished goods inventory 
contributing to lower segment earnings in compared to were higher freight costs from fuel surcharges and higher other direct material and utility costs 
energy  freight and other direct material costs were million higher in than in  partially offset by efficiency gains  cost controls and lower selling  general and administrative costs in while pricing pressures continue on all of our raw materials  other direct materials and freight and utility costs  we continue to work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes  as well as to preserve our margins 
in october the company announced plans to close two manufacturing facilities in north america by the end of as part of the realignment of the metal food and household products packaging  americas  segment following the acquisition of us can earlier in the year 
the company closed a leased facility in alliance  ohio  which was one of manufacturing locations acquired from us can  and a plant in burlington  ontario  which was part of the metal food can operations prior to the us can acquisition 
a pretax charge of million million after tax was recorded in the fourth quarter  primarily related to the burlington closure for employee termination and pension costs  plant decommissioning costs and fixed asset impairment 
the closure of the ohio plant has been treated as an opening balance sheet item 
the estimated costs of the closures will be cash flow neutral after tax benefits and anticipated proceeds from the sale of fixed assets 
the company continues to evaluate the segment s manufacturing structure and expects to identify other opportunities to improve efficiencies 
additional details regarding business consolidation activities are available in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements included within item of this annual report 
plastic packaging  americas the plastic packaging  americas  segment consists of operations located in the us and canada which manufacture polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging 
segment sales in comprised percent of consolidated sales percent in and increased percent compared to due largely to the plant and other asset acquisitions from alcan and higher pet bottle volumes 
we continue to focus pet development efforts in the custom hot fill  beer  wine  flavored alcoholic beverage and specialty container markets  and we are adding specialty container production capacity to accommodate new demand 
in the food and specialty area  development efforts are focused on custom markets as well 
the percent sales increase in compared to was largely due to the pass through to our customers of higher resin prices  as well as percent higher sales volumes in compared to as a result of higher demand for barrier and heat set containers that provide longer shelf life for products  combined with strong demand for plastic water bottles 
although only a small percentage of our total volume  sales of juice  sports drink and beer containers increased in these sales are expected to grow in the future as more focus is placed on such specialty markets and the development of our heat tek tm business 
we estimate our shipments of more than billion pet plastic containers to be approximately percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments 
in addition  the plastic packaging  americas  segment produced more than million food and specialty containers during page of segment earnings were million in compared to million in and million in segment earnings in were higher than in largely due to the incremental sales from the alcan acquisition  but were partially offset by energy cost increases of approximately million  the timing of resin cost increases and costs incurred for a litigation claim that was favorably resolved in july earnings in the second quarter of also included purchase accounting adjustments of million  which increased cost of sales due to the valuation of inventories associated with the acquired alcan finished goods inventory 
in the plastic packaging  americas  segment will include the sales and earnings of a plastic pail business which was recorded in the operating results of the metal food and household products packaging  americas  segment 
the improvement in earnings in over was the result of higher sales and production volumes and growth in specialty products 
partially offsetting these improvements in were higher utility costs 
segment earnings in were reduced by million  primarily related to costs associated with the relocation of the plastics offices and research and development facility from atlanta  georgia  to colorado 
earnings in were also negatively impacted by continued pricing pressures on plastic containers for carbonated soft drink and water customers 
aerospace and technologies aerospace and technologies segment sales represented percent of consolidated net sales percent in and were percent lower than in sales in were percent higher than in the lower sales were largely due to contracts being completed during the period  as well as the impact of government funding reductions and program delays 
higher sales in compared to resulted from a combination of newly awarded contracts and additions to previously awarded contracts 
the aerospace and technologies business won a number of large  strategic contracts and delivered a considerable amount of sophisticated space and defense instrumentation throughout the three year period 
segment earnings were million in  million in and million in the first quarter of included expense of million for the write down to net realizable value of an equity investment in an aerospace company 
this investment was sold in october for approximately its carrying value 
earnings in were negatively affected by the lower sales due to program delays and unfavorable contract mix 
the improvement in earnings compared to was primarily the result of higher sales and improved program performance 
some of the segment s high profile contracts include worldview and worldview  advanced commercial remote sensing satellites  the james webb space telescope  a successor to the hubble space telescope  the space based space surveillance system  which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris  npoess  the next generation satellite weather monitoring system  and a number of antennas for the joint strike fighter 
sales to the us government  either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor  represented percent of segment sales in  percent in and percent in contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
year to year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 
additional segment information for additional information regarding the company s segments  see the summary of business segment information in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
the charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by ball management  actuaries and other independent parties and were developed from information available at the time 
if actual outcomes vary from the estimates  the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses 
additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
page of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in sg a expenses in compared to was primarily the result of million of incremental sg a after realized synergies from the acquired us can operations  a million out of period adjustment discussed below  higher expense of million associated with the adoption of sfas no 
revised  million for higher rates associated with the company s receivables sales agreement  million of increased legal fees related to patent litigation  million for an initial mark to market adjustment to one of the company s deferred compensation stock plans due to a plan amendment and normal compensation and benefit increases 
expenses in were lower than in all areas of the company due largely to lower employee compensation and benefit costs  including the company s deposit share program and economic value added based incentive compensation plans 
these lower costs were partially offset by higher pension costs  higher accounts receivable securitization fees and the write down of the prc and aerospace equity investments in the first quarter of subsequent to the issuance of its financial statements for the year ended december   the company determined that certain foreign currency exchange losses had been inadvertently deferred for the years  and since the amounts were not material  individually or in the aggregate  to any previously issued financial statements or to our full year results of operations for  a cumulative million out of period adjustment was included in sg a expenses in the first quarter of on october   ball s board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of the out of the money  unvested nonqualified stock options granted in april the acceleration affected approximately  options granted to approximately employees at an exercise price of 
the accelerated vesting of these nonqualified options allowed the company to eliminate approximately million of pretax expense approximately million after tax combined for to interest and taxes consolidated interest expense was million in  million  including debt refinancing costs of million  in and million in the higher expense in was primarily due to the additional borrowings used to finance the acquisitions of us can and the alcan assets 
the lower expense in compared to was due to lower average borrowings and higher capitalized interest 
the debt refinancing costs in of million were costs associated with the refinancing of the company s senior credit facilities and the redemption in the last half of of the company s senior notes  which were due in august ball s consolidated effective income tax rate for was percent compared to percent in and percent in while the effective tax rates for and are similar  the rate was impacted by a one time tax benefit of million associated with a foreign exchange loss as a result of the change in the functional currency of a european subsidiary in the local statutory accounts 
the one time benefit was somewhat offset by a higher foreign tax rate differential due to taxation of the german property insurance gain at the marginal rate of and a valuation allowance on a canadian net operating loss resulting from the business consolidation costs 
the rate was impacted by the tax benefit recorded on the repatriation of foreign earnings see further discussion below plus the tax benefit on business consolidation costs applied at the higher marginal rate 
the decrease in the effective tax rate compared to is primarily due to the net tax benefit recorded on the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of jobs act  the tax benefit on business consolidation costs applied at the marginal tax rate  increased research and development tax credits and the manufacturing deduction effective in under the jobs act 
further details of the amounts repatriated under the jobs act are available in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
these benefits were somewhat offset by the fact that no tax benefit was provided in respect of the equity investment write downs in the first quarter of the million write down of the aerospace investment is not tax deductible while the realization of tax deductibility of the million prc write down  which will be a capital loss  is not reasonably assured as the company does not have  nor does it anticipate  any capital gains to offset the capital losses 
page of in connection with the internal revenue service s irs examination of ball s consolidated income tax returns for the tax years through  the irs has proposed to disallow ball s deductions of interest expense incurred on loans under a company owned life insurance plan that has been in place for more than years 
ball believes that its interest deductions will be sustained as filed and  therefore  no provision for loss has been recorded 
the total potential liability for the audit years through  unaudited year and an estimate of the impact on is approximately million  excluding related interest 
the irs has withdrawn its proposed adjustments for any penalties 
see note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this annual report 
results of equity affiliates equity in the earnings of affiliates in is primarily attributable to our percent ownership in packaging investments in the us and brazil 
earnings in included the results of a minority owned aerospace business  which was sold in october  and a million loss representing ball s share of a provision for doubtful accounts relating to its percent interest in sanshui jfp discussed above in metal beverage packaging  europe asia 
after consideration of the prc loss  earnings were million in compared to million in and million in critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements for information regarding the company s critical and significant accounting policies  as well as recent accounting pronouncements  see note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in and million in management internally uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company s operating results  for planning purposes  to evaluate strategic investments and to evaluate the company s ability to incur and service debt 
free cash flow is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles  and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures 
the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment capital spending 
free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company s cash flow statements  however  it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 
an example of such an item included in is the property insurance proceeds for the replacement of the fire damaged assets in our hassloch  germany  plant  which is included in capital spending amounts 
based on this  our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows in millions cash flows from operating activities capital spending proceeds for replacement of fire damaged assets free cash flow cash flows from operating activities in were negatively affected by higher cash pension funding and higher working capital levels compared to the prior year 
the higher working capital was a combination of higher than planned raw material inventory levels  higher income tax payments and higher accounts receivable balances  the latter resulting primarily from the repayment of a portion of the accounts receivable securitization program and late payments from customers in europe 
management expects the increase in working capital to be temporary and that working capital levels will return to normal levels by the end of the first half of page of cash flow in compared to was negatively impacted by higher cash taxes 
this resulted in a decrease in deferred income taxes payable of million in compared to an estimated increase in deferred taxes of million in the primary causes of the increase in current income taxes and decrease in deferred income taxes were the reduction in of tax deductible pension costs versus  the impact in of the repatriation of foreign earnings and a reduction of tax versus book depreciation expense as tax depreciation was accelerated in prior years  primarily due to bonus tax depreciation permitted in the tax laws after september  cash flows from operating activities were positively affected in by lower accounts receivable  higher accounts payable and lower pension contributions 
based on information currently available  we estimate cash flows from operating activities for to be approximately million  capital spending net of property insurance recoveries to be approximately million and free cash flow to be in the million range 
capital spending of million net of million in insurance recoveries in was below depreciation and amortization expense of million 
we continue to invest capital in our best performing operations  including projects to increase custom can capabilities  improve beverage can end making productivity and convert lines from steel to aluminum in europe  as well as expenditures in the aerospace and technologies segment 
debt facilities and refinancing interest bearing debt at december   increased million to  million from  million at december  this increase includes the issuance by ball corporation in march of million of senior notes due in and a million increase in bank debt under ball corporation s senior credit facilities put in place in the fourth quarter of the proceeds from these financings were used to refinance existing us can debt at lower interest rates  acquire certain net assets of alcan and reduce seasonal working capital debt 
other than acquisition related debt  the debt increase from was primarily attributed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
at december   million was available under the company s multi currency revolving credit facilities 
the company also had million of short term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year  of which million was outstanding 
on october   ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities and during the third and fourth quarters of  ball redeemed its senior notes due august primarily through the drawdown of funds under the new credit facilities 
the refinancing and redemption resulted in a pretax debt refinancing charge of million million after tax to reflect the call premium associated with the senior notes and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
during the first quarter of  ball repaid million million of its previous euro denominated term loan b and reduced the interest rate by basis points 
during the fourth quarter of  ball repaid million of its previous us dollar denominated term loan b and million of its previous euro denominated term loan b 
at the time of the early repayment  the interest rate on the us portion of the term loan b was reduced by basis points 
interest expense during the first quarter of included million for the write off of the unamortized financing costs associated with the repaid loans 
the company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing  revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of ball s north american packaging operations  up to million 
the agreement qualifies as off balance sheet financing under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company was not in default of any loan agreement at december   and has met all payment obligations

we reduced our share repurchase program in to million  net of issuances  compared to million net repurchases in and million in the net repurchases in did not include a forward contract entered into in december for the repurchase of  shares 
the contract was settled on january   for million in cash 
in we expect to repurchase approximately million  net of issuances  and to reduce debt levels by more than million 
annual cash dividends paid on common stock were cents per share in and and cents per share in total dividends paid were million in  million in and million in page of contingencies the company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due  in part  to the competitive nature of the industries in which we participate  our operations in developing markets outside the us  changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products and changing capital markets 
where practicable  we attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures  including  at times  the use of derivative financial instruments as explained in item a of this report 
from time to time  the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business 
additionally  the us environmental protection agency has designated ball as a potentially responsible party  along with numerous other companies  for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites 
our information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity  results of operations or financial condition of the company 
due to political and legal uncertainties in germany  no nationwide system for returning beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed in january  and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in non refillable containers 
we responded to the resulting lower demand for beverage cans with several measures including reducing capacity and converting production lines from steel to aluminum to facilitate exports from germany to other european countries 
since may   all retailers have been required to redeem all returned one way containers as long as they sell such containers 
many retailers in germany have begun the process of implementing a returnable system for one way containers 
the retailers and the filling and packaging industries have formed a committee to design a nationwide recollection system and several retailers have ordered and installed reverse vending machines in order to streamline the recollection system 
one way packaging sales by german retailers have increased significantly since may  albeit off a low base 
we believe it will take some time to recover from the significant decrease experienced beginning in usage will increase as one way collection systems are more fully developed and consumers become educated regarding the systems and the reintroduction of one way packaging 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
future events could affect these estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report for a summary of the company s critical and significant accounting policies 
the us and european economies have experienced minor general inflation during the past several years 
management believes that evaluation of ball s performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical financial statements 
as described in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this annual report  the irs has proposed to disallow ball s deductions of interest expense for the tax years through incurred on loans under a company owned life insurance plan that was established in ball has disputed the irs s claims and the company believes the interest deductions will be sustained as filed

you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our k  q and k reports to the securities and exchange commission 
page of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and risk management in the ordinary course of business  we employ established risk management policies and procedures to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates  foreign currencies and prices of the company s common stock in regard to common share repurchases 
although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit  market and interest risk  the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements 
we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis 
market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments  financial instruments and commodity positions 
to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure  we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices or rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
commodity price risk we manage our commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts which generally include aluminum based pricing terms that consider price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases 
such terms generally include a fixed price  floating price or an upper limit to the aluminum component pricing 
this matched pricing affects substantially all of our metal beverage packaging  americas  net sales 
we also  at times  use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass through arrangement in the sales contract 
most of the plastic packaging  americas  sales contracts negotiated through the end of include provisions to pass through resin cost changes 
as a result  we believe we have minimal  if any  exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin 
most of our metal food and household products packaging  americas  sales contracts negotiated through the end of either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur  or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs 
we anticipate that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur through the end of in europe and asia  the company manages aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long term contracts for the purchase of the materials  as well as certain sales of containers  that reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year 
these purchase and sales contracts include fixed price  floating and pass through pricing arrangements 
we also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to minimize the company s exposure to significant price changes for those sales contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement 
considering the effects of derivative instruments  the market s ability to accept price increases and the company s commodity price exposures  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the company s steel  aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
additionally  if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by percent  we estimate there could be a million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related to metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and related payables at our foreign operations  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for utilities such as natural gas and electricity  as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost 
a hypothetical percent increase in our utility prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period 
a hypothetical percent increase in our diesel fuel surcharge could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
page of interest rate risk our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we use a variety of interest rate swaps and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
interest rate instruments held by the company at december  and  included pay fixed interest rate swaps 
pay fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments 
based on our interest rate exposure at december   assumed floating rate debt levels throughout and the effects of derivative instruments  a basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings associated with foreign exchange rate changes through the use of cash flow hedges 
in addition  we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options 
our foreign currency translation risk results from the european euro  british pound  canadian dollar  polish zloty  chinese renminbi  brazilian real  argentine peso and serbian dinar 
we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and  to a lesser extent  in other currencies 
sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and  where there is not a foreign exchange pass through arrangement  the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures 
considering the company s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december   and the currency exposures  a hypothetical percent reduction in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
this amount includes the million currency exposure discussed above in the commodity price risk section 
this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by million 
actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 
common share repurchases in connection with the company s ongoing share repurchases  the company periodically sells put options which give the purchasers of those options the right to sell shares of the company s common stock to the company on specified dates at specified prices upon the exercise of those options 
our objective in selling put options is to lower the average purchase price of acquired shares 
there were no put option contracts outstanding at the end of page of
