item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview amerigas partners is the largest retail propane marketer in the united states  with sales to retail customers of more than a billion gallons during the year ended september  fiscal 
we deliver propane to more than a million customers from our distribution locations in states 
the propane industry is mature  with only modest growth in residential customer demand 
accordingly  our growth strategy focuses on acquisition of other propane marketers and internal growth to be achieved by leveraging our geographic coverage to secure regional and national accounts  serving the growing grill cylinder program and offering superior customer service 
during the past three years our financial results reflect growth achieved through acquisitions of retail propane distribution and cylinder refurbishment businesses  additions of multi location regional and national accounts and new distribution points for our cylinder exchange operation  and growth in our traditional residential and commercial customer base 
during fiscal  we achieved record net income of million which includes  among other things  the effects of a million gain from the sale of our million barrel liquefied petroleum gas storage facility located in arizona 
net income during the year ended september  fiscal includes the impact of a million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to debt refinancings 
colder temperatures during fiscal had a favorable impact on our retail volumes sold and total margin compared to the prior year 
our amerigas cylinder exchange program also experienced higher volumes sold primarily reflecting customer growth 
in fiscal and beyond  we will continue to focus on growing our traditional customer base  as well as growing through acquisitions and our strategic account and grill cylinder program 
we expect to achieve base business growth by providing best in class customer service and improving the effectiveness of our sales force  while maintaining competitive prices 
in addition  we plan to manage the growth rate of operating and administrative expenses by executing a series of initiatives to enhance safety and productivity 
analysis of results of operations the following analysis compares the partnership s results of operations for fiscal with fiscal and fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal

management believes ebitda is a meaningful non gaap financial measure used by investors to compare the partnership s operating performance with other companies within the propane industry and to evaluate the partnership s ability to meet loan covenants 
the partnership s definition of ebitda may be different from that used by other companies 
weather significantly impacts demand for propane and profitability because many customers use propane for heating purposes 
the following table includes reconciliations of net income to ebitda for the fiscal years presented year ended september  net income income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization ebitda c deviation from average heating degree days for the year period of based upon national weather statistics provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for airports in the united states  excluding alaska 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal temperatures in the partnership s service territories based upon heating degree days during fiscal were warmer than normal compared with temperatures that were warmer than normal during fiscal retail propane volumes sold increased approximately reflecting greater demand attributable to the colder weather and the effects of higher sales in our amerigas cylinder exchange program 
retail propane revenues increased million reflecting an million increase due to higher average selling prices and million due to the higher volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues decreased slightly reflecting a million decrease due to lower volumes sold largely offset by a million increase due to higher average selling prices 
in fiscal  our average retail propane product cost per retail gallon sold was approximately higher than in fiscal resulting in higher year over year prices to our customers 
total cost of sales increased to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal primarily reflecting the increase in propane product costs and the increased volumes sold 
total margin increased million principally due to the higher average retail propane margins per gallon  the higher volumes and higher fees in response to increases in operating and administrative expenses 
ebitda during fiscal increased million as a result of the previously mentioned increase in total margin  a gain from the sale of the partnership s storage facility in arizona  and the absence of a million loss on early extinguishments of debt recorded in fiscal partially offset by a million increase in operating and administrative expenses 
the million loss on early extinguishments of debt incurred during fiscal was associated with the refinancings of amerigas olp s series a and series c first mortgage notes totaling million  and million of amerigas partners senior notes  with million of amerigas partners senior notes due the partnership also used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to repay amerigas olp s million term loan 
the increase in fiscal operating and administrative expenses principally resulted from higher employee compensation and benefits  vehicle costs and maintenance and repairs expenses 
both fiscal and benefited from favorable expense reductions related to general insurance primarily reflecting improved claims experience 
operating income increased million mainly reflecting the previously mentioned increase in ebitda but excluding the impact of the prior period s million loss on extinguishment of debt which is included in ebitda but not operating income slightly offset by greater depreciation expense 
net income in fiscal increased million reflecting the increase in operating income  the absence of the fiscal loss on extinguishment of debt and a decrease in interest expense 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal temperatures in our service territories based upon heating degree days during fiscal were warmer than normal compared with temperatures that were warmer than normal during fiscal retail propane volumes sold decreased approximately principally due to the warmer winter weather and the negative effects of customer conservation driven by continued high propane selling prices 
retail propane revenues increased million reflecting a million increase due to higher average selling prices partially offset by a million decrease due to the lower retail volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues decreased million reflecting a million decrease due to lower volumes sold partially offset by a million increase due to higher average selling prices 
in fiscal  our average retail propane product cost per retail gallon sold was approximately higher than in fiscal resulting in higher year over year prices to our customers 
total cost of sales was  million in fiscal compared to  million in fiscal  primarily reflecting the increase in propane product costs partially offset by the decreased volumes sold 
total margin increased million principally due to higher average propane margins per gallon and higher fees in response to increases in operating and administrative expenses 
ebitda during fiscal increased million compared to fiscal as a result of the previously mentioned increase in total margin and a million decrease in losses on early extinguishments of debt million of such losses in fiscal compared to million in fiscal 
these favorable year over year changes were partially offset by a million increase in operating and administrative expenses and a million decrease in other income 
other income in fiscal benefited from a million pre tax gain on the sale of amerigas propane s ownership interest in atlantic energy to energy services  inc energy services  which is owned by an affiliate of ugi 
the increase in operating and administrative expenses principally resulted from higher vehicle fuel and lease costs  employee compensation and benefits costs  and repairs and maintenance expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a million favorable net expense reduction related to general insurance and litigation  primarily reflecting improved claims history 
during fiscal  the partnership recovered significant increases in certain costs  such as vehicle fuel  through delivery surcharges 
operating income increased million reflecting the previously mentioned increase in total margin and a million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense  largely offset by the aforementioned million increase in operating and administrative expenses and decrease in other income 
net income in fiscal increased million principally reflecting the previously mentioned increase in ebitda and a million decrease in interest expense resulting from the previously mentioned debt refinancings and reduced use of our revolving credit facility 

table of contents financial condition and liquidity capitalization and liquidity the partnership s debt outstanding at september  totaled million 
there were no amounts outstanding under amerigas olp s credit agreement at september  amerigas olp s credit agreement expires on october  and consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million acquisition facility 
the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and general purposes of amerigas olp 
the acquisition facility provides amerigas olp with the ability to borrow up to million to finance the purchase of propane businesses or propane business assets or  to the extent it is not so used  for working capital and general purposes  subject to restrictions in the amerigas partners senior notes indentures 
issued and outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  which reduce the amount available for borrowings  totaled million at september  and million at september  approximately the same amounts were outstanding all year in each of the respective fiscal years 
amerigas olp s short term borrowing needs are seasonal and are typically greatest during the fall and winter heating season months due to the need to fund higher levels of working capital 
the average daily and peak bank loan borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement during fiscal were million and million  respectively 
there were no significant borrowings under the credit agreement during fiscal amerigas partners periodically issues equity securities in public offerings and may continue to do so 
proceeds from the partnership s equity offerings have generally been used by the partnership to reduce indebtedness and for general partnership purposes  including funding acquisitions 
the partnership has an effective unallocated debt and equity shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission sec under which it may issue common units or senior notes due in underwritten public offerings 
in order to borrow under its credit agreement  amerigas olp must satisfy certain financial covenants including  but not limited to  a minimum interest coverage ratio  a maximum debt to ebitda ratio and a minimum ebitda  as defined 
amerigas olp s financial covenants calculated as of september  permitted it to borrow up to the maximum amount available under its credit agreement 
for a more detailed discussion of the partnership s credit facilities  see note to consolidated financial statements 
based upon existing cash balances  cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowings available under its credit agreement  the partnership s management believes that the partnership will be able to meet its anticipated contractual commitments and projected cash needs in fiscal partnership distributions the partnership makes distributions to its partners approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter in a total amount equal to its available cash as defined in the third amended and restated agreement of limited partnership  as amended the partnership agreement for such quarter 
available cash generally means all cash on hand at the end of such quarter  plus all additional cash on hand as of the date of determination resulting from borrowings after the end of such quarter  less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion 

table of contents the general partner may establish reserves for the proper conduct of the partnership s business and for distributions during the next four quarters 
in addition  certain of the partnership s debt agreements require reserves be established for the payment of debt principal and interest 
distributions of available cash are made to limited partners and to the general partner giving effect to the interest of the general partner in distributions of available cash from amerigas olp to amerigas partners until available cash exceeds the minimum quarterly distribution of and the first target distribution of per common unit or a total of per common unit 
if available cash exceeds per common unit in any quarter  the general partner will receive a greater percentage of the total partnership distribution than its general partner interest in amerigas partners the incentive distribution but only with respect to the amount by which the distribution per common unit to limited partners exceeds 
accordingly  because the partnership made distributions to common unitholders of per limited partner unit on may  and per limited partner unit on august  which amount included a one time per limited partner unit increase in the regular quarterly distribution reflecting a distribution of a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the partnership s arizona storage facility  the general partner received a greater percentage of the total partnership distributions than its aggregate general partner interest in amerigas partners and amerigas olp 
the total amount of distributions received by the general partner with respect to its general partner interest in amerigas partners during fiscal totaled million which includes approximately million of incentive distributions 
as previously mentioned  on july   the general partner s board of directors approved a distribution of per common unit payable on august  to unitholders of record on august  this distribution included the regular quarterly distribution of per common unit and per common unit reflecting a distribution of a portion of the proceeds from the partnership s sale of its arizona storage facility in july a reasonable proxy for the amount of cash available for distribution that is generated by the partnership can be calculated by subtracting from the partnership s ebitda interest expense and capital expenditures needed to maintain operating capacity and adding back losses on extinguishments of debt associated with refinancings 

table of contents partnership distributable cash as calculated under this method for fiscal  and is as follows year ended september  millions of dollars net income income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization ebitda interest expense maintenance capital expenditures loss on extinguishment of debt distributable cash although distributable cash is a reasonable estimate of the amount of cash available for distribution by the partnership  it does not reflect  among other things  the impact of changes in working capital and the amount of distributable cash used to finance growth capital expenditures  which can significantly affect cash available for distribution 
distributable cash should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations and is not a measure of performance or financial condition under gaap 
management believes distributable cash is a meaningful non gaap measure for evaluating the partnership s ability to declare and pay distributions pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement 
the partnership s definition of distributable cash may be different from that used by other companies 
the ability of the partnership to pay distributions on all units depends upon a number of factors 
these factors include the level of partnership earnings  the cash needs of the partnership s operations including cash needed for maintaining and increasing operating capacity  changes in operating working capital  and the partnership s ability to borrow under its credit agreement  to refinance maturing debt and to increase its long term debt 
some of these factors are affected by conditions beyond our control including weather  competition in markets we serve  the cost of propane and changes in capital market conditions 

table of contents contractual cash obligations and commitments the partnership has certain contractual cash obligations that extend beyond fiscal including obligations associated with long term debt  interest on long term fixed rate debt  lease obligations and propane supply contracts 
the following table presents significant contractual cash obligations as of september  payments due by period fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal millions of dollars total and thereafter long term debt interest on long term fixed rate debt operating leases propane supply contracts total cash flows operating activities 
due to the seasonal nature of the partnership s business  cash flows from operating activities are generally strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane consumed during the heating season months 
conversely  operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the first and fourth fiscal quarters when the partnership s investment in working capital  principally accounts receivable and inventories  is generally greatest 
the partnership may use its credit agreement to satisfy its seasonal operating cash flow needs 
cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash required to fund changes in operating working capital totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal compared to cash provided from changes in operating working capital of million in fiscal the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal primarily reflects the improved earnings partially offset by greater cash used to fund working capital 
investing activities 
cash flow used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we spent million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal compared to expenditures of million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal in july  the partnership completed the sale of its million barrel liquefied petroleum gas storage terminal located near phoenix  arizona for net cash proceeds of million 
also during fiscal  the partnership acquired several retail propane distribution businesses  including the retail distribution businesses of all star gas corporation and shell gas lpg usa  and several cylinder refurbishing businesses for total net cash consideration of million 
financing activities 
cash flow used by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the partnership s financing activities are typically the result of repayments and issuances of long term debt  borrowings under our credit agreement  issuances of common units and distributions on partnership interests 

table of contents related party transactions in september  in conjunction with a propane business acquisition  the partnership issued  common units to the general partner in consideration for the retention of certain income tax liabilities at a price of per common unit 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements for more information related to this transaction 
pursuant to the partnership agreement and a management services agreement among amerigas eagle holdings  inc  the general partner of eagle olp  and the general partner  the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on behalf of the partnership 
these costs  which totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  include employee compensation and benefit expenses of employees of the general partner and general and administrative expenses 
ugi corporation ugi provides certain financial and administrative services to the general partner 
ugi bills the general partner for all direct and indirect corporate expenses incurred in connection with providing these services and the general partner is reimbursed by the partnership for these expenses 
such corporate expenses totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  ugi and certain of its subsidiaries provide office space and automobile liability insurance to the partnership 
these costs totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
amerigas olp purchases propane from ugi energy services  inc and subsidiaries energy services  which is owned by an affiliate of ugi 
purchases of propane by amerigas olp from energy services totaled million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
amounts due to energy services at september  and totaled million and million  respectively  which are included in accounts payable related parties in our consolidated balance sheets 
the partnership sold propane to certain affiliates of ugi 
such amounts were not material during fiscal  or off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are expected to have an effect on the partnership s financial condition  change in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
market risk disclosures our primary financial market risks include commodity prices for propane and interest rates on borrowings 
the risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the partnership pays for propane is principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for propane and other energy commodities 
the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs and the partnership generally passes on increases in such costs to customers 
the partnership may not  however  always be able to pass through product cost increases fully  particularly when product costs rise rapidly 
in order to reduce the volatility of the partnership s propane market price risk  we use contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane  
table of contents propane fixed price supply agreements  and over the counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts 
over the counter derivative commodity instruments utilized by the partnership to hedge forecasted purchases of propane are generally settled at expiration of the contract 
in order to minimize credit risk associated with derivative commodity contracts  we monitor established credit limits with the contract counterparties 
although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the partnership has both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable rate debt but generally do not impact its fair value 
conversely  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact their cash flows 
our variable rate debt includes borrowings under amerigas olp s credit agreement 
this agreement has interest rates that are generally indexed to short term market interest rates 
the partnership generally did not need to use its revolving credit facility during fiscal to fund its operations 
at september  and  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
the remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed rate debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair market value of this debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
our long term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt having similar terms and credit ratings 
as these long term debt issues mature  we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then current market conditions 
this debt may have an interest rate that is more or less than the refinanced debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt  from time to time we enter into interest rate protection agreements 

table of contents the following table summarizes the fair values of unsettled market risk sensitive derivative instruments held at september  and it also includes the changes in fair value that would result if there were a ten percent adverse change in the market price of propane and the three month libor change in fair fair value value millions of dollars september  propane swap contracts interest rate protection agreements september  propane swap and option contracts interest rate protection agreements because the partnership s derivative instruments generally qualify as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to manage propane price or interest rate risk would be substantially offset by gains or losses on the associated anticipated transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the selection and application of appropriate accounting principles to the relevant facts and circumstances of the partnership s operations and the use of estimates made by management 
the partnership has identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
changes in these policies could have a material effect on the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies necessarily requires management s most subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  with its audit committee 
in addition  management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
litigation accruals 
the partnership is involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business 
in accordance with gaap  the partnership establishes reserves for pending claims and legal actions when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets 
we compute depreciation on property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives generally ranging from to years 
we also use amortization methods and determine asset values of intangible assets other than goodwill using reasonable assumptions and projections 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and changes in intangible asset amortization methods or values could have a material effect on our results of operations 
as of september   our net property  plant and equipment totaled million 
depreciation expense of million was recorded during fiscal 
table of contents purchase price allocation 
from time to time  we enter into material business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  the purchase price is allocated to the various assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair value 
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal 
estimating fair values can be a complex and judgmental area and most commonly impacts property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  including those with indefinite lives 
generally  we have  if necessary  up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize the purchase price allocation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
in february and sfas no 
fair value measures in september see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of such pronouncements
