critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to accounts receivable allowance  inventory valuation and obsolescence  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
additionally  we use assumptions and estimates in calculations to determine stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  goodwill  product warranties  stock based compensation  income taxes 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized when the product ships provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  collectability is probable and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
the company considers the guidance for revenue recognition in the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company s revenue transactions can on occasion include product sales with multiple element arrangements  generally for installation 
the elements are considered separate units of accounting because the delivered product has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to each element based on its estimated relative fair market value 
fair market value is determined using entity specific and third party evidence 
a portion of the arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue when the product is shipped and a portion of the arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue when the installation service is performed 
the value of the undelivered elements includes the fair value of the installation 
if the terms of the sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated  all revenues are deferred and not recognized until such acceptance occurs 
the company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  if any  and the installation process 
the company defers revenue for extended service contracts related to future periods and recognizes revenue on a straight line basis in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
the company provides for estimated warranty costs on original product warranties at the time of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s senior management reviews accounts receivable on a periodic basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible 
the company includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible  along with a general reserve for estimated probable losses based on historical experience  in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
based on the information available to the company  it believes the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  is adequate 
however  actual write offs might exceed the recorded allowance 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value  with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
at december  inventory consisted of raw material and finished goods of approximately  and  respectively  for  and raw material and finished goods of approximately  and  respectively  for the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory primarily based upon estimated utility of its inventory as well as other factors 
long lived assets long lived assets  other than goodwill  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of patents  technology intangibles  trade name and distribution agreements purchased in the acquisition of issi in june and cadx in december these assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of to years 
goodwill the company follows the provision of financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires companies to use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas addresses the accounting for acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually 
product warranties the company provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranty against defects in material and workmanship based on historical warranty trends in the volume of product returns during the warranty period 
stock based compensation the company maintains stock based incentive plans  under which it provides stock incentives to employees and directors 
the company grants options to employees and directors to purchase common stock at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the date of grant 
prior to the effective date of sfas r  the company applied apb  and related interpretations  for its stock option grants 
apb provides that the compensation expense relative to its stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant 
effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year  the company adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior periods are not restated 
the company used the black scholes and lattice option pricing models which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates  including estimates of the expected term participants will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of its common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the provisions of sfas r apply to new stock options and stock options outstanding  but not yet vested  on the date the company adopted sfas r 
stock based compensation expense was included in applicable departmental expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal period 
income taxes the company follows the liability method under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the primary objectives of accounting for taxes under sfas are to a recognize the amount of tax payable for the current year and b recognize the amount of deferred tax liability or asset for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the company s financial statements or tax returns
