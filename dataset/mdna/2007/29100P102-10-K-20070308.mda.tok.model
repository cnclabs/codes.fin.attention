in february  amr merged with another leading ambulance company and became the largest ambulance service provider in the united states 
emcare holdings inc  or emcare  was founded in dallas  texas  in and initially grew by providing emergency department staffing and related management services to larger hospitals in the texas marketplace 
emcare then expanded its presence nationally  primarily through a series of acquisitions in the s 
amr and emcare were acquired by laidlaw international  inc  previously laidlaw inc laidlaw  in and became wholly owned subsidiaries 
effective january   an investor group led by onex partners lp and onex corporation onex  and including members of our management  purchased our operating subsidiaries amr and emcare from laidlaw through a holding company  emergency medical services lp  or ems lp  a limited partnership formed at the time of this acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
from the completion of our acquisition of amr and emcare  we operated through the holding company  ems lp  until the formation of emsc  which is a delaware corporation 
a re organization was effected concurrently with our initial public offering of common stock on december   which resulted in amr  emcare and ems lp becoming subsidiaries of emsc  and emsc controlling of the voting power of ems lp 
we own  and onex owns  of the equity in ems lp 
onex s equity interest is held through lp exchangeable units that are immediately exchangeable for  and substantially equivalent to  our class b common stock 
description of our business emergency medical services industry we operate in the ambulance and emergency department services markets  two large and growing segments of the emergency medical services market 
by law  most communities are required to provide emergency ambulance services and most hospitals are required to provide emergency department services 
emergency medical services are a core component of the range of care a patient could potentially receive in the pre hospital and hospital based settings 
accordingly  we believe that expenditures for emergency medical services will continue to correlate closely to growth in the us hospital market and that the following key factors will continue to drive growth in our emergency medical services markets increase in outsourcing 
communities  government agencies and healthcare facilities are under significant pressure both to improve the quality and to reduce the cost of care 
the outsourcing of certain medical services has become a preferred means to alleviate these pressures 
favorable demographics 
the growth and aging of the population will be a significant demand driver for healthcare services  and we believe it will result in an increase in ambulance transports  emergency department visits and hospital admissions 
the us census bureau estimates that the number of americans over will increase to million by from million in it is also expected that americans over the age of will increase from one in eight americans in to one in five by increased federal funding for disaster preparedness and other federal programs 
the united states government has increased its focus on our nation s ability to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies  including both terrorist attacks and natural disasters 
federal programs  such as homeland security  fema and funding for services for undocumented aliens  have made increased funding available for emergency services 
additional factors that may affect the emergency medical services industry are described elsewhere in this report 
see item a  risk factors risk factors related to healthcare regulation and business regulatory matters 
ambulance services we believe the ambulance services market represents annual expenditures of approximately billion 
the ambulance services market is highly fragmented  with more than  private  public and not for profit service providers accounting for an estimated million ambulance transports in there are a limited number of regional ambulance providers and we are one of only two national ambulance providers 
ambulance services encompass both emergency response and non emergency transport services  including critical care transfers  wheelchair transports and other inter facility transports 
emergency response services include the dispatch of ambulances equipped with life support equipment and staffed with paramedics and or emergency medical technicians  or emts  to provide immediate medical care to injured or ill patients 
non emergency services utilize paramedics and or emts to transport patients between healthcare facilities or between facilities and patient residences 
given demographic trends  we expect the total number of ambulance transports to continue to grow at a steady rate of to per year 
emergency response services are provided primarily under long term contracts with communities and government agencies 
non emergency services generally are provided pursuant to non exclusive contracts with healthcare facilities  managed care and insurance companies 
usage tends to be controlled by the facility discharge planners  nurses and physicians who are responsible for requesting transport services 
non emergency services are provided primarily by private ambulance companies 
quality of service  dependability and name recognition are critical factors in winning non emergency business 
emergency department services we believe the physician reimbursement component of the emergency department services market represents annual expenditures of approximately billion 
there are approximately  hospitals in the united states that operate emergency departments  of which approximately of these hospitals outsource their physician staffing and management for this department 
the market for outsourced emergency department staffing and related management services is highly fragmented  with more than national  regional and local providers 
we believe we are one of only five national providers 
between and  the total number of patient visits to hospital emergency departments increased from million to million  an increase of 
at the same time  the number of hospital emergency departments declined 
as a result  the average number of patient visits per hospital emergency department increased substantially during that period 
we believe these trends are resulting in an increased focus by hospitals on their emergency departments 
as the per hospital demand for emergency department visits continues to increase  we believe that more hospitals will turn to well established providers  such as emcare  which have a demonstrated track record of improving productivity and efficiency while providing high quality care 
business segments and services we operate our business and market our services under our two business segments amr and emcare 
we provide ambulance transport services in states and the district of columbia and provide services to emergency department and hospitalist programs in states 
the following is a detailed business description for our two business segments 
american medical response american medical response  inc  or amr  is the leading provider of ambulance services in the united states 
amr and our predecessor companies have a long history in emergency medical services  having provided services to some communities for more than years 
as of december  we had an share of the total ambulance services market and a share of the private provider ambulance market 
during fiscal  amr treated and transported approximately million patients in states utilizing more than  vehicles that operated out of more than sites 
amr has approximately  contracts with communities  government agencies  healthcare providers and insurers to provide ambulance transport services 
amr s broad geographic footprint enables us to contract on a national and regional basis with managed care and insurance companies 
for fiscal  approximately of amr s net revenue was generated from emergency ambulance services  which include treating and stabilizing patients  transporting the patient to a hospital or other healthcare facility and providing attendant medical care en route 
non emergency ambulance services  including critical care transfer  wheelchair transports and other interfacility transports  accounted for of amr s net revenue for the same period  with the balance generated from the provision of training  dispatch centers and other services to communities and public safety agencies 
as derived from our annual consolidated or combined financial statements found elsewhere in this report  amr s revenues  income from operations  and total assets were as follows for each of the periods indicated amounts in thousands as of and for the year eleven months five months year ended ended ended ended december  december  january  august  net revenue income from operations total assets see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information on amr s financial results 
we provide substantially all of our ambulance services under our amr brand name 
we operate under other names when required to do so by local statute or contractual agreement 
services we provide a full range of emergency and non emergency ambulance transport and related services  which include emergency response services 
we provide emergency response services primarily under long term exclusive contracts with communities and hospitals 
our contracts typically stipulate that we must respond to calls in the designated area within a specified response time 
we utilize two types of ambulance units advanced life support  or als  units and basic life support  or bls  units 
als units  which are staffed by two paramedics or one paramedic and an emergency medical technician  or emt  are equipped with high acuity life support equipment such as cardiac monitors  defibrillators and oxygen delivery systems  and carry pharmaceutical and medical supplies 
bls units are generally staffed by two emts and are outfitted with medical supplies and equipment necessary to administer first aid and basic medical treatment 
the decision to dispatch an als or bls unit is determined by our contractual requirements  as well as by the nature of the patient s medical situation 
under certain of our emergency response contracts  we are the first responder to an emergency scene 
however  under most of our contracts  the local fire department is the first responder 
in these situations  the fire department typically begins stabilization of the patient 
upon our arrival  we continue stabilization through the provision of attendant medical care and transport the patient to the closest appropriate healthcare facility 
in certain communities where the fire department historically has been responsible for both first response and emergency services  we seek to develop public private partnerships with fire departments rather than compete with them to provide the emergency transport service 
these partnerships emphasize collaboration with the fire departments and afford us the opportunity to provide emergency services in communities that  for a variety of reasons  may not otherwise have outsourced this service to a private provider 
in most instances  the provision of emergency services under our partnerships closely resembles that of our most common contracts described above 
the public private partnerships lower our costs by reducing the number of full time paramedics we would otherwise require 
we estimate that the contracts that encompass these public private partnerships represented approximately of amr s net revenue for fiscal non emergency transport services 
we provide transportation to patients requiring ambulance or wheelchair transport with varying degrees of medical care needs between healthcare facilities or between healthcare facilities and their homes 
unlike emergency response services  which typically are provided by communities or private providers under exclusive or semi exclusive contracts  non emergency transportation usually involves multiple contract providers at a given facility  with one or more of the competitors designated as the preferred provider 
non emergency transport business generally is awarded by a healthcare facility  such as a hospital or nursing home  or a healthcare payor  such as an hmo  managed care organization or insurance company 
non emergency transport services include i inter facility critical care transport  ii wheelchair and stretcher car transports  and iii other inter facility transports 
critical care transports are provided to medically unstable patients such as cardiac patients and neonatal patients who require critical care while being transported between healthcare facilities 
critical care services differ from als services in that the ambulance may be equipped with additional medical equipment and may be staffed by one of our medical specialists or by an employee of a healthcare facility to attend to a patient s specific medical needs 
wheelchair and stretcher car transports are non medical transportation provided to handicapped and certain non ambulatory persons in some service areas 
in providing this service  we use vans that contain hydraulic wheelchair lifts or ramps operated by drivers who generally are trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation  or cpr 
other inter facility transports  that require advanced or basic levels of medical supervision during transfer  may be provided when a home bound patient requires examination or treatment at a healthcare facility or when a hospital inpatient requires tests or treatments such as magnetic resonance imaging  or mri  testing  cat scans  dialysis or chemotherapy treatment available at another facility 
we use als or bls ambulance units to provide general ambulance services depending on the patient s needs 
other services 
in addition to our emergency and non emergency ambulance services  we provide the following services dispatch services 
our dispatch centers manage our own calls and  in certain communities  also manage dispatch centers for public safety agencies  such as police and fire departments  aeromedical transport programs and others 
event medical services 
we provide medical stand by support for concerts  athletic events  parades  conventions  international conferences and vip appearances in conjunction with local and federal law enforcement and fire protection agencies 
we have contracts to provide stand by support for numerous sports franchises  as well as for various nascar events  hollywood production studios and other specialty events 
managed transportation services 
managed care organizations and insurance companies contract with us to manage various of their medical transportation related needs  including call taking and scheduling  management of a network of transportation providers and billing and reporting through our internally developed systems 
paramedic training 
we own and operate national college of technical instruction  or ncti  the largest paramedic training school in the united states and the only accredited institution of its size  with over graduates each year 
air ambulance services 
we own air ambulance specialists  inc  a company that arranges world wide air ambulance transportation 
medical personnel and quality assurance approximately of our  employees have daily contact with patients  including approximately  paramedics   emts and nurses 
paramedics and emts must be state certified to transport patients and perform emergency care services 
certification as an emt requires completion of a minimum of hours of training in a program designated by the united states department of transportation  such as those offered at our training institute  ncti 
once this program is completed  state certified emts are then eligible to participate in a state certified paramedic training program 
the average paramedic program involves over  hours of academic training in advanced life support and assessment skills 
in most communities  local physician advisory boards develop medical protocols to be followed by paramedics and emts in a service area 
in addition  instructions are conveyed on a case by case basis through direct communications between the ambulance crew and hospital emergency room physicians during the administration of advanced life support procedures 
both paramedics and emts must complete continuing education programs and  in some cases  state supervised refresher training examinations to maintain their certifications 
we maintain a commitment to provide high quality pre and post hospital emergency medical care 
in each location in which we provide services  a physician associated with a hospital we serve monitors adherence to medical protocol and conducts periodic audits of the care provided 
in addition  we hold retrospective care audits with our employees to evaluate compliance with medical and performance standards 
our commitment to quality is reflected in the fact that of our dispatch centers across the country are accredited by the commission on accreditation of ambulance services  or caas  representing of the total caas accredited centers 
caas is a joint program between the american ambulance association and the american college of emergency physicians 
the accreditation process is voluntary and evaluates numerous qualitative factors in the delivery of services 
we believe communities and managed care providers increasingly consider accreditation as one of the criteria in awarding contracts 
billing and collections our internal patient billing services  or pbs  offices located across the united states invoice and collect for our services 
we receive payment from the following sources the federal and state governments  primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs  health maintenance organizations and private insurers  individual patients  and community subsidies and fees 
the table below presents the approximate percentages of amr s net revenue from the following sources percentage of amr net revenue year eleven months year ended ended ended december  december  august  medicare medicaid commercial insurance managed care self pay subsidies fees total net revenue see business regulatory matters medicare  medicaid and other government program reimbursement for additional information on reimbursement from medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored programs 
we have substantial experience in processing claims to third party payors and employ a billing staff trained in third party coverage and reimbursement procedures 
our integrated billing and collection systems allow us to tailor the submission of claims to medicare  medicaid and certain other third party payors and has the capability to electronically submit claims to the extent third party payors systems permit 
this system also provides for tracking of accounts receivable and status pending payment 
companies in the ambulance services industry maintain significant provisions for doubtful accounts compared to companies in other industries 
collection of complete and accurate patient billing information during an emergency service call is sometimes difficult  and incomplete information hinders post service collection efforts 
in addition  we cannot evaluate the creditworthiness of patients requiring emergency transport services 
our allowance for doubtful accounts generally is higher for transports resulting from emergency ambulance calls than for non emergency ambulance requests 
see item a  risk factors risk factors related to healthcare regulation changes in the rates or methods of third party reimbursements may adversely affect our revenue and operations 
state licensing requirements  as well as contracts with communities and healthcare facilities  typically require us to provide ambulance services without regard to a patient s insurance coverage or ability to pay 
as a result  we often receive partial or no compensation for services provided to patients who are not covered by medicare  medicaid or private insurance 
the anticipated level of uncompensated care and uncollectible accounts is considered in negotiating a government paid subsidy to provide for uncompensated care  and permitted rates under contracts with a community or government agency 
a significant portion of our ambulance transport revenue is derived from medicare payments 
the balanced budget act of  or bba  modified medicare reimbursement rates for emergency transportation with the introduction of a national fee schedule 
the bba provided for a phase in of the national fee schedule by blending the new national fee schedule rates with ambulance service suppliers pre existing reasonable charge reimbursement rates 
the bba provided for this phase in period to begin on april   and full transition to the national fee schedule rates became effective on january  in some regions  the national fee schedule would have resulted in a decrease in medicare reimbursement rates of approximately by the end of the phase in period 
partially in response to the dramatic decrease in rates dictated by the bba in some regions  the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  or the medicare modernization act  established regional rates  certain of which are higher than the bba s national rates  and provided for the blending of the regional and national rates until january  other rate provisions included in the medicare modernization act provided further temporary mitigation of the impact of the bba decreases  including a provision that provided for to increases for blended rates for the period from january  through december  because the medicare modernization act relief is of limited duration  we will continue to pursue strategies to offset the decreases mandated by the bba  including seeking fee and subsidy increases 
we estimate that the impact of the ambulance service rate decreases under the national fee schedule mandated under the bba  as modified by the phase in provisions of the medicare modernization act  resulted in a decrease in amr s net revenue for the fiscal year ended august   of approximately million  resulted in an increase in amr s net revenue of approximately million during calendar year  and in a decrease in amr s net revenue of approximately million in based upon the current medicare transport mix  we expect a further decrease in our net revenue totaling approximately million for the period through we have been able to substantially mitigate the phase in reductions of the bba through additional fee and subsidy increases 
as a emergency response provider  we are uniquely positioned to offset changes in reimbursement by requesting increases in the rates we are permitted to charge for services from the communities we serve 
in response  these communities often permit us to increase rates for ambulance services from patients and their third party payors in order to ensure the maintenance of required community wide emergency response services 
while these rate increases do not result in higher payments from medicare and certain other public or private payors  overall they increase our revenue 
see regulatory matters medicare  medicaid and other government program reimbursement for additional information on reimbursement from medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored programs 
contracts emergency transport 
as of december   we had contracts with communities and government agencies to provide emergency response services 
contracts with communities to provide emergency transport services are typically exclusive  three to five years in length and generally are obtained through a competitive bidding process 
in some instances where we are the existing provider  communities elect to renegotiate existing contracts rather than initiate new bidding processes 
our contracts often contain options for earned extensions or evergreen provisions 
we have improved our contract retention rate to for fiscal compared to in fiscal in fiscal year ended december   our top ten contracts accounted for approximately million  or of amr s net revenue 
we have served these ten customers on a continual basis for an average of years 
our emergency response arrangements typically specify maximum fees we may charge and set forth minimum requirements  such as response times  staffing levels  types of vehicles and equipment  quality assurance and insurance coverage 
communities and government agencies may also require us to provide a performance bond or other assurances of financial responsibility 
the rates we are permitted to charge for services under a contract for emergency ambulance services and the amount of the subsidy  if any  we receive from a community or government agency depend in large part on the nature of the services we provide  payor mix and performance requirements 
non emergency transport 
we have approximately  arrangements to provide non emergency ambulance services with hospitals  nursing homes and other healthcare facilities that require a stable and reliable source of medical transportation for their patients 
these contracts typically designate us as the preferred ambulance service provider of non emergency ambulance services to those facilities and permit us to charge a base fee  mileage reimbursement  and additional fees for the use of particular medical equipment and supplies 
we have historically provided a significant portion of our non emergency transports to facilities and organizations in competitive markets without specific contracts 
non emergency transports often are provided to managed care or insurance plan members who are stabilized at the closest available hospital and are then moved to facilities within their health plan s network 
we believe the increased prevalence of managed care benefits larger ambulance service providers  which can service a higher percentage of a managed care provider s members 
this allows the managed care provider to reduce its number of vendors  thus reducing administrative costs and allowing it to negotiate more favorable rates with healthcare facilities 
our scale and broad geographic footprint enable us to contract on a national and regional basis with managed care and insurance companies 
we have contracts with large healthcare networks and insurers including kaiser  aetna  healthnet  cigna and summacare 
we believe that communities  government agencies  healthcare facilities  managed care companies and insurers consider the quality of care  historical response time performance and total cost to be among the most important factors in awarding and renewing contracts 
dispatch and communications dispatch centers control the deployment and dispatch of ambulances in response to calls through the use of sophisticated communications equipment hours a day  seven days a week 
in many operating sites  we communicate with our vehicles over dedicated radio frequencies licensed by the federal communications commission 
in certain service areas with a large volume of calls  we analyze data on traffic patterns  demographics  usage frequency and similar factors with the aid of system status management  or ssm technology  to help determine optimal ambulance deployment and selection 
in addition to dispatching our own ambulances  we also provide dispatching service for communities where we are not an ambulance service provider 
our dispatch centers are staffed by emts and other experienced personnel who use local medical protocols to analyze and triage a medical situation and determine the best mode of transport 
emergency transport 
depending on the emergency medical dispatch system used in a designated service area  the public authority that receives emergency medical calls either dispatches our ambulances directly from the public control center or communicates information regarding the location and type of medical emergency to our control center which  in turn  dispatches ambulances to the scene 
while the ambulance is en route to the scene  the ambulance receives information concerning the patient s condition prior to the ambulance s arrival at the scene 
our communication systems allow the ambulance crew to communicate directly with the destination hospital to alert hospital medical personnel of the arrival of the patient and the patient s condition and to receive instructions directly from emergency room personnel on specific pre hospital medical treatment 
these systems also facilitate close and direct coordination with other emergency service providers  such as the appropriate police and fire departments  that also may be responding to a call 
non emergency transport 
requests for non emergency transports typically are made by physicians  nurses  case managers and hospital discharge coordinators who are interested primarily in prompt ambulance arrival at the requested pick up time 
we are also offering on line  web enabled transportation ordering to certain facilities 
we use our millennium software to track and manage requests for transportation services for large healthcare facilities and managed care companies 
management information systems we support our operations with integrated information systems and standardized procedures that enable us to efficiently manage the billing and collections processes and financial support functions 
our recently developed technology solutions provide information for operations personnel  including real time operating statistics  tracking of strategic plan initiatives  electronic purchasing and inventory management solutions 
we have three management information systems that we believe have significantly enhanced our operations our e pcr technology  an electronic record keeping system  our millennium call taking system  a call taking application that tracks and manages requests for transportation services for large healthcare facilities and managed care companies  and our ssm ambulance positioning system  a technology which enables us to use historical data on fleet usage patterns to predict where our emergency transport services are likely to be required 
sales and marketing our person sales and marketing team is focused on contract retention as well as generating new sales 
many new sales opportunities occur through referrals from our existing client base 
these team members are frequently former paramedics or emts who began their careers in the emergency transportation industry and are therefore well qualified to understand the needs of our customers 
our sales force is incentivized through a compensation package that includes base salary and bonus potential based on achieving specified performance targets 
we respond to requests for proposals that generally include demographic information of the community or facilities  response time parameters  vehicle and equipment requirements  the length of the contract  the minimum qualifications of bidders  billing information  selection criteria and the format to be followed in the bid 
prior to responding to a request for proposal  amr s management team ensures that the proposal is in line with certain financial and service parameters 
management evaluates all aspects of each proposal  including financial projections  staffing models  resource requirements and competition  to determine how to best achieve our business objectives and the customer goals 
risk management we train and educate all new employees about our safety programs including  among others  emergency vehicle operations  various medical protocols  use of equipment and patient focused care and advocacy 
our safety training also involves continuing education programs and a monthly safety awareness campaign 
we also work directly with manufacturers to design equipment modifications that enhance both patient and clinician safety 
our safety and risk management team develops and executes strategic planning initiatives focused on mitigating the factors that drive losses in our operations 
we aggressively investigate and respond to all incidents we believe may result in a claim 
operations supervisors submit documentation of such incidents to the third party administrator handling the claim 
we have a dedicated liability unit with our third party administrator which actively engages with our staff to gain valuable information for closure of claims 
information from the claims database is an important resource for identifying trends and developing future safety initiatives 
we utilize an on board monitoring system  roadsafety  which measures operator performance against our safe driving standards 
our operations using roadsafety have experienced improved driving behaviors within days of installation 
roadsafety has been implemented in approximately of our vehicles in emergency response markets 
competition our predominant competitors are fire departments  with approximately of the ambulance transport services market 
firefighters have traditionally acted as the first responders during emergencies  and in many communities provide emergency medical care and transport as well 
in many communities we have established public private partnerships  in which we integrate our transport services with the first responder services of the local fire department 
we believe these public private partnerships provide a model for us to collaborate with fire departments to increase the number of communities we serve 
competition in the ambulance transport market is based primarily on pricing  the ability to improve customer service  such as on time performance and efficient call intake  the ability to recruit  train and motivate employees  particularly ambulance crews who have direct contact with patients and healthcare personnel  and billing and reimbursement expertise 
our largest competitor  rural metro corporation  is the only other national provider of ambulance transport services and generates ambulance transport revenue less than half of amr s net revenue 
other private provider competitors include southwest ambulance in arizona and new mexico  acadian ambulance service in louisiana and small  locally owned operators that principally serve the inter facility transport market 
insurance workers compensation  auto and general liability 
we have retained liability for the first million to million of the loss under these programs since september   managed either through ace american insurance co 
or laidlaw s captive insurance program 
generally  our umbrella policies covering claims that exceed our deductible levels have an annual cap of approximately million 
for periods prior to september   we were fully insured for our workers compensation  auto and general liability programs through laidlaw s captive insurance program 
professional liability 
since april   we have a self insured retention for our professional liability coverage  which covers the first million for the policy year ending april   and covers the first to million for policy periods after april  we have umbrella policies with third party insurers covering claims exceeding these retention levels with an aggregate cap of million for each separate policy period 
for periods prior to april   we are insured for our professional liability claims through third party insurers 
environmental matters we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the presence of hazardous materials and pollution and the protection of the environment  including those governing emissions to air  discharges to water  storage  treatment and disposal of wastes  including medical waste  remediation of contaminated sites  and protection of worker health and safety 
we believe our current operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental requirements and that we maintain all material permits required to operate our business 
certain environmental laws impose strict  and under certain circumstances joint and several  liability for investigation and remediation of the release of regulated substances into the environment 
such liability can be imposed on current or former owners or operators of contaminated sites  or on persons who dispose or arrange for disposal of wastes at a contaminated site 
releases have occurred at a few of the facilities we lease as a result of historical practices of the owners or former operators 
based on available information  we do not believe that any known compliance obligations  releases or investigations under environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
however  there can be no guarantee that these releases or newly discovered information  more stringent enforcement of or changes in environmental requirements  or our inability to enforce available indemnification agreements will not result in significant costs 
employees the following is the break down of our employees by job classification as of december  job classification full time part time total paramedics emergency medical technicians nurses support personnel total approximately of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements 
twenty five of these collective bargaining agreements  representing approximately  employees  are subject to renegotiation in we believe we have a good relationship with our employees and have never experienced any union related work stoppages 
emcare emcare is the largest provider of outsourced emergency department staffing and related management services to healthcare facilities in the united states 
as of december   emcare had a share of the total emergency department services market and a share of the outsourced emergency department services market 
during the fiscal year ended december   emcare had approximately million patient visits in states 
emcare has contracts with hospitals and independent physician groups to provide emergency department and hospitalist staffing  management and other administrative services 
we believe that emcare s successful physician recruitment and retention  high level of customer service and advanced risk management programs have resulted in an improvement in our contract retention rate from in to in fiscal we have added net new contracts since emcare primarily provides emergency department staffing and related management services to healthcare facilities 
we recruit and hire or subcontract with physicians and other healthcare professionals  who then provide professional services to the hospitals with whom we contract 
we also have practice support agreements with independent physician groups and hospitals pursuant to which we provide unbundled management services such as billing and collection  recruiting  risk management and certain other administrative services 
in addition  we have become one of the leading providers of hospitalist services 
a hospitalist is a physician who specializes in the care of acutely ill patients in an in patient setting 
while we have provided limited hospitalist services for the past years  it is only in the last years that we have focused on expanding this program  including through our acquisition in november of clinical staffing solutions  or css  physician in patient business serving facilities in pennsylvania and new jersey 
we have increased our hospitalist programs from contracts as of august  to contracts as of december   increasing our net revenue for this program from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million  or approximately of emcare s net revenue  for fiscal as of december   we independently contracted with or employed hospitalist physicians 
as derived from our annual consolidated or combined financial statements found elsewhere in this report  emcare s revenues  income from operations  and total assets were as follows for each of the periods indicated amounts in thousands as of and for the year eleven months five months year ended ended ended ended december  december  january  august  net revenue income from operations total assets see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information on emcare s financial results 
services we provide a full range of outsourced physician staffing and related management services for emergency department and hospitalist programs  which include contract management 
we utilize an integrated approach to contract management that involves physicians  non clinical business experts  and operational and quality assurance specialists 
an on site medical director is responsible for the day to day oversight of the operation  including clinical quality  and works closely with the hospital s management in developing strategic initiatives and objectives 
the regional director of operations  which is a clinical position  provides systems analysis and improvement plans 
a quality manager develops site specific quality improvement programs  and a practice improvement staff focuses on chart documentation and physician utilization patterns 
the regional based management staff provides support for these efforts and ensures that each customer s expectations are identified  that service plans are developed and executed to meet those expectations  and that the company s and the customer s financial objectives are achieved 
staffing 
we provide a full range of staffing services to meet the unique needs of each healthcare facility 
our dedicated clinical teams include qualified  career oriented physicians and other healthcare professionals responsible for the delivery of high quality  cost effective care 
these teams also rely on managerial personnel  many of whom have clinical experience  who oversee the administration and operations of the clinical area 
ensuring that each contract is staffed with the appropriately qualified physicians and that coverage is provided without any service deficiencies is critical to the success of the contract 
we believe that our approach to recruiting  staffing and scheduling provides us with a unique advantage in achieving these objectives 
recruiting 
many healthcare facilities lack the dedicated resources necessary to identify and attract specialized  career oriented physicians 
we have committed significant resources to the development of emsource  a proprietary national physician database that we utilize in our recruiting programs across the country 
our marketing and recruiting staff continuously updates our database of more than  physicians with relevant data and contact information to allow us to match potential physician candidates to specific openings based upon personal preferences 
this targeted recruiting method increases the success and efficiency of our recruiters  and we believe significantly increases our physician retention rates 
we actively recruit physicians through various media options including telemarketing  direct mail  conventions  journal advertising and our internet site 
scheduling 
our scheduling departments assist our medical directors in scheduling physicians and other healthcare professionals in accordance with the coverage model at each facility 
we provide hour service to ensure that unscheduled shift vacancies  due to situations such as physician illness and personal emergencies  are filled with alternative coverage 
payroll administration and benefits 
we provide payroll administration services for the physicians and other healthcare professionals with whom we contract to provide services at customer sites 
additionally  healthcare facilities benefit from the elimination of the overhead costs associated with the administration of payroll and  where applicable  employee benefits 
customer satisfaction programs 
we design and implement customized patient satisfaction programs for our hospital customers 
these programs are designed to improve patient satisfaction through the use of communication  family inclusion and hospitality techniques 
these programs are delivered to the clinical and non clinical members of the hospital emergency department 
other services 
we provide a substantial portion of our services to hospitals through our affiliate physician groups 
there are situations in which hospitals and physicians are interested in receiving stand alone management services such as billing and collection  scheduling  recruitment and risk management  and at times we unbundle our services to meet this need 
pursuant to these practice support agreements  which generally will have a term of one to three years  we provide these services to independent physician groups and healthcare facilities 
during  we had practice support agreements which generated million in net revenue 
operational assessments 
we undertake operational assessments for our hospital customers that include comprehensive reviews of critical operational matrices  including turnaround times  triage systems  left without being seen  throughput times and operating systems 
these assessments establish baseline values  develop and implement process improvement programs  and then we monitor the success of the initiatives 
this is an ongoing process that we continually monitor and modify 
practice improvement 
we provide ongoing comprehensive documentation review and training for our affiliated physicians 
we review certain statistical indicators that allow us to provide specific training to individual physicians regarding documentation  and we tailor training for broader groups of physicians as we see trends developing in documentation related areas 
our training focuses on the completeness of the medical record or chart  specific payor requirements  and government rules and regulations 
risk management we utilize our risk management department  senior medical leadership and on site medical directors to conduct aggressive risk management and quality assurance programs 
we take a proactive role in promoting early reporting  evaluation and resolution of incidents that may evolve into claims 
our risk management function is designed to mitigate risk associated with the delivery of care and to prevent or minimize costs associated with medical professional liability claims and includes incident reporting systems 
we have established a comprehensive support system for medical professionals 
our risk management hotline provides each physician with the ability to discuss medical issues with a peer 
in the event of a negative patient outcome  the physician may discuss legal and medical issues in anticipation of litigation directly with an emcare attorney experienced with medical malpractice issues 
tracking and trending claims 
we have an extensive claims database developed from our experience in the emergency department setting 
from this database  we track multiple data points on each professional liability claim 
we utilize the database to identify claim trends and risk factors so that we can better target our risk management initiatives 
each year  we target the medical conditions associated with our most frequent professional liability claims  and provide detailed education to assist our affiliated medical professionals in treating these medical conditions 
professional risk assessment 
we conduct risk assessments of our medical professionals 
typically  a risk assessment includes a thorough review of professional liability claims against the professional  assessment of issues raised by hospital risk management and identification of areas where additional education may be advantageous for the professional 
hospital risk assessment 
we conduct risk assessments of potential hospital customers in conjunction with our sales and contracting process 
as part of the risk assessment  registered nurses or physicians employed by us conduct a detailed analysis of the hospital s operations affecting the emergency department or hospitalist services  including the triage procedures  on call coverage  transfer procedures  nursing staffing and related matters in an effort to address risk factors contractually during negotiations with potential customer hospitals 
clinical fail safe programs 
we review and identify key risk areas which we believe may result in increased incidence of patient injuries and resulting claims against us and our affiliated medical professionals 
we continue to develop fail safe clinical tools and make them available to our affiliated physicians for use in conjunction with their practice and to our customer hospitals for use as a part of their peer review process 
these fail safe tools assist physicians in identifying common patient attributes and complaints that may identify the patient as being at high risk for certain conditions eg  a heart attack 
quality improvement programs 
our medical directors are actively engaged in their respective hospital s quality improvement committees and initiatives 
in addition  we provide tools that provide guidance to the medical directors on how to conduct quality reviews of their physicians and help them track their physicians medical practices 
physician education programs 
our wholly owned subsidiary  emergency medical education systems  inc emeds  conducts physician education through risk management and board review conferences and on line teaching modules 
our affiliated medical professionals can access emeds to obtain valuable medical information 
our internal continuing education services are fully accredited by the accreditation council for continuing medical education 
this allows us to grant our physicians and nurses continuing education credits for internally developed educational programs at a lower cost than if such credits were earned through external programs 
our risk management department also provides other forms of education  including articles in the company newsletter that highlight current medical literature on important emergency medicine topics 
proactive professional liability claims handling 
we utilize a third party claims administrator to manage professional liability claims against companies and medical professionals covered under our insurance program 
for each case  detailed reports are reviewed to ensure proactively that the defense is comprehensive and aggressive 
each professional liability claim brought against an emcare affiliated medical professional or emcare affiliated company is reviewed by emcare s claims committee  consisting of physicians  attorneys and company executives  before any resolution of the claim 
the claims committee periodically instructs emcare s risk management department to undertake an analysis of particular physicians or hospital locations associated with a given claim 
billing and collections we receive payment for patient services from the federal and state governments  primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and private insurers  hospitals  and individual patients 
the table below presents the approximate percentages of emcare s net revenue from the following sources percentage of emcare net revenue year ended december  eleven months ended december  year ended august  medicare medicaid commercial insurance managed care self pay subsidies fees total net revenue see business regulatory matters medicare  medicaid and other government program reimbursement for additional information on reimbursement from medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored programs 
we code and bill for physician services through our wholly owned subsidiary  reimbursement technologies  inc we utilize state of the art document imaging and paperless workflow processes to expedite the billing cycle and improve compliance and customer service 
currently  at of our customer locations  medical records and emergency department logs are scanned and transmitted electronically to us 
we are in the process of transitioning additional customers to on site scanning 
we do substantially all of the billing for our affiliated physicians  and we have extensive experience in processing claims to third party payors 
we employ a billing staff of approximately employees who are trained in third party coverage and reimbursement procedures 
our integrated billing and collection system uses proprietary software to tailor the submission of claims to medicare  medicaid and certain other third party payors and has the capability to electronically submit most claims to the third party payors systems 
we forward uncollected accounts electronically to two outside collection agencies automatically  based on established parameters 
each of these collection agencies have on site employees working at our in house billing company to assist in providing patients with quality customer service 
contracts we have contracts with i hospital customers to provide professional staffing and related management services  ii healthcare facilities and independent physician groups to provide management services  and iii affiliated physician groups and medical professionals to provide management services and various benefits 
we deliver services to our hospital customers and their patients through two principal types of contractual arrangements 
emcare or a subsidiary most frequently contracts directly with the hospital to provide physician staffing and management services 
in some instances  a physician owned professional corporation contracts with the hospital to provide physician staffing and management services  and the professional corporation  in turn  contracts with us for a wide range of management and administrative services  including billing  scheduling support  accounting and other services 
the professional corporation pays our management fee out of the fees it collects from patients  third party payors and  in some cases  the hospital customer 
our physicians and other healthcare professionals who provide services under these hospital contracts do so pursuant to independent contractor or employment agreements with us  or pursuant to arrangements with the professional corporation that has a management agreement with us 
we refer to all of these physicians as our affiliated physicians  and these physicians and other individuals as our healthcare professionals 
hospital and practice support contracts 
as of december   emcare provides services under contracts 
generally  the agreements with the hospitals are awarded on a competitive basis  and have an initial term of three years with one year automatic renewals and termination by either party on specified notice 
we have improved our contract retention rate to for the fiscal year ended december   up from in fiscal our contracts with hospitals provide for one of three payment models we bill patients and third party payors directly for physician fees  we bill patients and third party payors directly for physician fees  with the hospital paying us an additional pre arranged fee for our services  and we bill the hospitals directly for the services of the physicians 
in all cases  the hospitals are responsible for billing and collecting for non physician related services 
we have established long term relationships with some of the largest healthcare service providers 
none of these customers represent revenue that amounts to of our total net revenue for the year ended december   or fiscal years ended december  or august  our top ten hospital emergency department contracts represent million  or  of emcare s net revenue for the year ended december  we have maintained our relationships with these customers for an average of years 
affiliated physician group contracts 
in most states  we contract directly with our hospital customers to provide physician staffing and related management services 
we  in turn  contract with a professional corporation that is wholly owned by one or more physicians  which we refer to as an affiliated physician group  or with independent contractor physicians 
it is these physicians who provide the medical professional services 
we then provide comprehensive management services to the physicians 
we typically provide professional liability and workers compensation coverage to our affiliated physicians 
certain states have laws that prohibit or restrict unlicensed persons or business entities from practicing medicine 
the laws vary in scope and application from state to state 
some of these states may prohibit us from contracting directly with hospitals or physicians to provide professional medical services 
in those states  the affiliated physician groups contract with the hospital  as well as all medical professionals 
we provide management services to the affiliated physician groups 
medical professional contracts 
we contract with healthcare professionals as either independent contractors or employees to provide services to our customers 
the healthcare professionals generally are paid an hourly rate for each hour of coverage  a variable rate based upon productivity or other objective criteria  or a combination of both a fixed hourly rate and a variable rate component 
we typically arrange for professional liability and workers compensation coverage for our healthcare professionals 
the contracts with healthcare professionals typically have one year terms with automatic renewal clauses for additional one year terms 
the contracts can be terminated with cause for various reasons  and usually contain provisions allowing for termination without cause by either party upon days notice 
agreements with physicians generally contain a non compete or non solicitation provision and  in the case of medical directors  a non compete provision 
the enforceability of these provisions varies from state to state 
management information systems we have invested in scalable information systems and proprietary software packages designed to allow us to grow efficiently and to deliver and implement our best practice procedures nationally  while retaining local and regional flexibility 
we have developed and implemented several proprietary applications that we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in our operations 
sales and marketing contracts for outsourced emergency department and hospitalist services are obtained through strategic marketing programs and responses to requests for proposals 
emcare s business development team includes practice development representatives located throughout the united states who are responsible for developing sales and acquisition opportunities for the operating group in his or her territory 
a significant portion of the compensation program for these sales professionals is commission based  based on the profitability of the contracts they sell 
leads are generated through regular marketing efforts by our business development group  our website  journal advertising and a lead referral program 
each practice development representative is responsible for working with the regional chief executive officer to structure and provide customer proposals for new prospects in their respective regions 
emergency medicine practices vary among healthcare facilities 
a healthcare facility request for proposal generally will include demographic information of the facility department  a list of services to be performed  the length of the contract  the minimum qualifications of bidders  billing information  selection criteria and the format to be followed in the bid 
prior to responding to a request for proposal  emcare s senior management ensures that the proposal is consistent with certain financial parameters 
senior management evaluates all aspects of each proposal  including financial projections  staffing model  resource requirements and competition  to determine how to best achieve our business objectives and the customer goals 
competition the market for outsourced emergency department staffing and related management services is highly fragmented  with more than national  regional and local providers handling an estimated million patient visits in there are more than  hospitals in the united states with emergency departments  of which approximately currently outsource physician services 
of these hospitals that outsource  we believe approximately contract with a local provider  contract with a regional provider and contract with a national provider 
team health is our largest competitor and has the second largest share of the emergency department services market with an approximately share 
the other national providers of outsourced emergency department services are sterling healthcare  national emergency service and the schumacher group 
insurance professional liability program 
for the period january  through december   our professional liability insurance program provided claims made insurance coverage with limits of million per loss event  with a million annual per physician aggregate  for all medical professionals whom we have agreed to cover under our professional liability insurance program 
our subsidiaries and affiliated corporate entities are provided with coverage of million per loss event and share a million annual corporate aggregate 
for the calendar year  lexington insurance company provided the majority of the professional liability insurance coverage covering claims occurring and reported during the calendar year  subject to an aggregate policy limit of million 
for the through calendar years  columbia casualty company and continental casualty company  collectively referred to as ccc  provided our professional liability insurance coverage 
the ccc policies have a retroactive date of january   thereby covering all claims occurring during the calendar year but reported in each of the through calendar years 
we also procured coverage on a regional basis under separate policies of insurance for the calendar years through  and have comparable coverage in calendar year captive insurance arrangement 
on december   we formed emca insurance company  ltd  or emca  as a wholly owned subsidiary under the companies law of the cayman islands 
emca reinsures ccc for all losses associated with the ccc insurance policies under the professional liability insurance program  and provides collateral for the reinsurance arrangement through a trust agreement 
workers compensation program 
for the period september  through august   we procured workers compensation insurance coverage for employees of emcare and affiliated physician groups through continental casualty company 
continental reinsures a portion of this workers compensation exposure  on both a per claim and an aggregate basis  with emca 
from september   emcare has insured  and continues to insure  its workers compensation exposure through the travelers indemnity company  which reinsures a portion of the exposure with emca 
employees and independent contractors the following is the break down of our active affiliated physicians  independent contractors and employees by job classification as of december  job classification full time part time total physicians physician assistants nurse practitioners non clinical employees total we believe that our relations with our employees and independent contractors are good 
none of our physicians  physician assistants  nurse practitioners or non clinical employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreement 
we offer our physicians substantial flexibility in terms of type of facility  scheduling of work hours  benefit packages  opportunities for relocation and career development 
this flexibility  combined with fewer administrative burdens  improves physician retention rates and stabilizes our contract base 
emsc competitive strengths we believe the following competitive strengths position our company to capitalize on the favorable trends occurring within the healthcare industry and the emergency medical services markets 
leading  established provider of emergency medical services 
we are a leading provider of emergency medical services in the united states 
we believe our track record of consistently meeting or exceeding our customers service expectations  coupled with our ability to leverage our infrastructure and technology to drive increased productivity and efficiency  have contributed to our ability to retain existing and win new contracts 
significant scale and geographic presence 
we believe our significant scale and broad geographic presence provide a competitive advantage over local and regional providers in most areas  including our cost efficiencies and broad program offerings  our ability to enter into national and regional contracts with managed care organizations and insurance companies  and our ability to recruit and retain quality personnel 
long term relationships with existing customers 
we believe our long term  well established relationships with communities and healthcare facilities enhance our ability to retain existing customers and win new contracts 
amr and emcare have maintained relationships with their ten largest customers for an average of and years  respectively  and during that time have continually demonstrated an ability to meet and exceed contractual commitments 
strong financial performance 
one of the key factors our potential customers evaluate is financial stability 
we believe the quality and breadth of our service offerings has allowed us to increase our net revenue at a faster rate than the market for emergency medical services 
we believe our ability to demonstrate consistently strong financial performance will continue to differentiate our company and provide a competitive advantage in winning new contracts and renewing existing contracts 
focus on risk management 
our risk management initiatives are enhanced by the use of our professional liability claims database and comprehensive claims management 
we analyze this data to demonstrate claim trends on a national  hospital  physician and procedure level  helping to manage and mitigate risk exposure 
amr s risk safety program is aimed at reducing worker injuries through training and improved equipment  and increasing vehicle safety through the use of technology 
investment in core technologies 
we utilize technology as a means to enhance the quality  reduce the cost of our service offerings  more effectively manage risk and improve our profitability 
amr uses proprietary technology to improve chart documentation  determine transportation service levels and track response times and other data for hospitals 
emcare uses proprietary physician recruitment software to improve recruitment efficiency and retention rates 
business strategy increase revenue from existing customers 
we believe our long track record of delivering excellent service and quality patient care  as well as the breadth of our services  creates opportunities for us to increase revenue from our existing customer base 
we have established strategies aimed at assisting communities and facilities to manage their cost of emergency medical services 
grow our customer base 
we believe we have a unique competency in the treatment  management and billing of episodic and unscheduled care 
we believe our long operating history  significant scope and scale and leading market position provide us with new and expanded opportunities to grow our customer base 
pursue select acquisition opportunities 
the emergency medical services industry is highly fragmented  with only a few large national providers  and presents opportunities for consolidation 
we plan to pursue select acquisitions in our existing business segments  including acquisitions to enhance our presence in existing markets and our entry into new geographic markets 
we will also explore the acquisition of complementary businesses and seek opportunities to expand the scope of services in which we can leverage our core competencies 
utilize technology to differentiate our services and improve operating efficiencies 
we intend to continue to invest in technologies that broaden our services in the marketplace  improve patient care  enhance our billing efficiencies and increase our profitability 
continued focus on risk management 
we will continue to conduct aggressive risk management programs for loss prevention and early intervention 
we will continue to develop and utilize clinical fail safes and use technology in our ambulances to reduce vehicular incidents 
implement cost rationalization initiatives 
we will continue to rationalize our cost structure by aligning compensation with productivity  developing risk management initiatives that are focused on mitigating risk exposures  and eliminating costs in our national and regional corporate support structure 
regulatory matters as a participant in the healthcare industry  our operations and relationships with healthcare providers such as hospitals  other healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by numerous federal and state government entities as well as local government agencies 
specifically  but without limitation  we are subject to the following laws and regulations 
medicare  medicaid and other government reimbursement programs we derive a significant portion of our revenue from services rendered to beneficiaries of medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored healthcare programs 
for fiscal  we received approximately of our net revenue from medicare and from medicaid 
to participate in these programs  we must comply with stringent and often complex enrollment and reimbursement requirements from the federal and state governments 
we are subject to governmental reviews and audits of our bills and claims for reimbursement 
retroactive adjustments to amounts previously reimbursed from these programs can and do occur on a regular basis as a result of these reviews and audits 
in addition  these programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  all of which may materially increase or decrease the payments we receive for our services as well as affect the cost of providing services 
in recent years  congress has consistently attempted to curb federal spending on such programs 
reimbursement to us typically is conditioned on our providing the correct procedure and diagnosis codes and properly documenting both the service itself and the medical necessity for the service 
incorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information  or the incorrect selection of codes for the level of service provided  could result in non payment for services rendered or lead to allegations of billing fraud 
moreover  third party payors may disallow  in whole or in part  requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable  they were for services provided that were not medically necessary  there was a lack of sufficient supporting documentation  or for a number of other reasons 
retroactive adjustments  recoupments or refund demands may change amounts realized from third party payors 
additional factors that could complicate our billing include disputes between payors as to which party is responsible for payment  the difficulty of adherence to specific compliance requirements  diagnosis coding and various other procedures mandated by the government  and failure to obtain proper physician credentialing and documentation in order to bill governmental payors 
due to the nature of our business and our participation in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs  we are involved from time to time in regulatory reviews  audits or investigations by government agencies of matters such as compliance with billing regulations and rules 
we may be required to repay these agencies if a finding is made that we were incorrectly reimbursed  or we may lose eligibility for certain programs in the event of certain types of non compliance 
delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement process adversely affect our level of accounts receivable  increase the overall cost of collection  and may adversely affect our working capital and cause us to incur additional borrowing costs 
unfavorable resolutions of pending or future regulatory reviews or investigations  either individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we establish an allowance for discounts applicable to medicare  medicaid and other third party payors and for doubtful accounts based on credit risk applicable to certain types of payors  historical trends  and other relevant information 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis and may increase or decrease such allowance from time to time  including in those instances when we determine that the level of effort and cost of collection of certain accounts receivable is unacceptable 
we believe that regulatory trends in cost containment will continue 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to offset reduced operating margins through cost reductions  increased volume  the introduction of additional procedures or otherwise 
ambulance services fee schedule 
in february  the health care financing administration  now renamed the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  issued the medicare ambulance fee schedule final rule  or final rule  that revised medicare policy on the coverage of ambulance transport services  effective april  the final rule was the result of a mandate under the balanced budget act of  or bba  to establish a national fee schedule for payment of ambulance transport services that would control increases in expenditures under part b of the medicare program  establish definitions for ambulance transport services that link payments to the type of services furnished  consider appropriate regional and operational differences and consider adjustments to account for inflation  among other provisions 
the final rule provided for a five year phase in of a national fee schedule  beginning april  prior to that date  medicare used a charge based reimbursement system for ambulance transport services and reimbursed of charges determined to be reasonable  subject to the limits fixed for the particular geographic area 
the patient was responsible for co pay amounts  deductibles and the remaining balance of the transport cost  if we did not accept the assigned reimbursement  and medicare required us to expend reasonable efforts to collect the balance 
in determining reasonable charges  medicare considered and applied the lowest of various charge factors  including the actual charge  the customary charge  the prevailing charge in the same locality  the amount of reimbursement for comparable services  and the inflation indexed charge limit 
on april   the final rule became effective 
the final rule categorizes seven levels of ground ambulance services  ranging from basic life support to specialty care transport  and two categories of air ambulance services 
ground providers are paid based on a base rate conversion factor multiplied by the number of relative value units assigned to each level of transport  plus an additional amount for each mile of patient transport 
the base rate conversion factor for services to medicare patients is adjusted each year by the consumer price index 
additional adjustments to the base rate conversion factor are included to recognize differences in relative practice costs among geographic areas  and higher transportation costs that may be incurred by ambulance providers in rural areas with low population density 
the final rule requires ambulance providers to accept assignment on medicare claims  which means a provider must accept medicare s allowed reimbursement rate as full payment 
medicare typically reimburses of that rate and the remaining is collectible from a secondary insurance or the patient 
originally  the final rule called for a five year phase in period to allow providers time to adjust to the new payment rates 
the national fee schedule was to be phased in at increments each year  with payments being made at of the national fee schedule in and thereafter 
with the passage of the medicare modernization act  temporary modifications were made to the amounts payable under the ambulance fee schedule in order to mitigate decreases in reimbursement in some regions caused by the final rule 
the medicare modernization act established regional fee schedules based on historic costs in each region 
effective july   in those regions where the regional fee schedule exceeds the national fee schedule  the regional fee schedule is blended with the national fee schedule on a temporary basis  until in addition to the regional fee schedule change  the medicare modernization act included other provisions for additional reimbursement for ambulance transport services provided to medicare patients 
among other relief  the medicare modernization act provided for a increase in reimbursement for urban transports and a increase for rural transports for the remainder of the original phase in period of the national ambulance fee schedule  through december  we estimate that the impact of the ambulance service rate decreases under the national fee schedule  as modified by the provisions of the medicare modernization act  resulted in a decrease in amr s net revenue for the fiscal year ended august  of approximately million  resulted in an increase in amr s net revenue of approximately million during calendar year  and resulted in a decrease in amr s net revenue of approximately million in based upon the current medicare transport mix  we expect a further decrease in our net revenue totaling approximately million for the period through we cannot predict whether congress may make further refinements and technical corrections to the law or pass a new cost containment statute in a manner and in a form that could adversely impact our business 
local ambulance rate regulation 
state or local government regulations or administrative policies regulate rate structures in some states in which we provide ambulance transport services 
for example  in certain service areas in which we are the exclusive provider of ambulance transport services  the community sets the rates for emergency ambulance services pursuant to an ordinance or master contract and may also establish the rates for general ambulance services that we are permitted to charge 
we may be unable to receive ambulance service rate increases on a timely basis where rates are regulated or to establish or maintain satisfactory rate structures where rates are not regulated 
medicare physician fee schedule 
medicare pays for all physician services based upon a national fee schedule  or fee schedule  which contains a list of uniform rates 
the payment rates under the fee schedule are determined based on national uniform relative value units for the services provided  a geographic adjustment factor and a conversion factor 
payment rates under the fee schedule are updated annually 
the initial element in each year s update calculation is the medicare economic index  or mei  which is a government index of practice cost inflation 
the update is then adjusted up or down from the mei based on a target setting formula system called the sustainable growth rate  or sgr 
the sgr is a target rate of growth in spending for physician services which is intended to control the growth of medicare expenditures for physicians services 
the fee schedule update is adjusted to reflect the comparison of actual expenditures to target expenditures 
because one of the factors for calculating the sgr system is linked to the us gross domestic product  the sgr formula may result in a negative payment update if growth in medicare beneficiaries use of services exceeds gdp growth 
since  the sgr formula has resulted in negative payment updates under the fee schedule which required congress to take legislative action to reverse the scheduled payment cuts 
in late  congress passed legislation to prevent a scheduled percent cut in medicare physician payments  and instead froze payment rates for one year 
the congressional budget office has predicted that medicare physician payment rates would be reduced percent in and the medicare trustees report predicts a total of nearly percent in cuts by unless congress takes additional action in the future to modify or reform the mechanism by which the fee schedule payment rates are updated  significant reductions in medicare reimbursement will continue to occur annually  and these reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
medicare reassignment 
the medicare program prohibits the reassignment of medicare payments due to a physician or other healthcare provider to any other person or entity unless the billing arrangement between that physician or other healthcare provider and the other person or entity falls within an enumerated exception to the medicare reassignment prohibition 
historically  there was no exception that allowed us to receive directly medicare payments related to the services of independent contractor physicians 
however  the medicare modernization act amended the medicare reassignment statute as of december  and now permits our independent contractor physicians to reassign their medicare receivables to us under certain circumstances 
in  cms promulgated regulations implementing this statutory change 
the regulations impose two additional program integrity safeguard requirements on reassignments made under the independent contractor exception 
these require that both the entity receiving payment and the physician be jointly and severally responsible for any medicare overpayment to that entity  and the physician have unrestricted access to claims submitted by an entity for services provided by the physician 
we have taken steps to ensure all reassignments by independent contractor physicians comply with these regulatory requirements 
rules applicable to midlevel practitioners 
emcare utilizes physician assistants and nurse practitioners  sometimes referred to collectively as midlevel practitioners  to provide care under the supervision of our physicians 
state and federal laws require that such supervision be performed and documented using specific procedures 
for example  in some states some or all of the midlevel practitioner s chart entries must be countersigned 
under applicable medicare rules  in certain cases  a midlevel practitioner s services are reimbursed at a rate equal to of the physician fee schedule amount and we do not bill separately for the supervising physician s services 
however  when a midlevel practitioner assists a physician who is directly and personally involved in the patient s care  we often bill for the services of the physician at the full physician fee schedule rates and do not bill separately for the midlevel practitioner s services 
we believe our billing and documentation practices related to our use of midlevel practitioners comply with applicable state and federal laws  but we cannot assure you that enforcement authorities will not find that our practices violate such laws 
ambulance rates payable by medicare hmos 
one of the changes made by ambulance fee schedule final rule was to require ambulance providers to accept assignment from medicare and medicare hmos 
medicare hmos are private insurance companies which operate managed care plans that enroll medicare beneficiaries who elect to enroll in a plan in lieu of regular medicare coverage 
when a provider accepts assignment  it agrees to accept the rate established by medicare as payment in full for services covered by medicare or the medicare hmo and to write off the balance of its charges 
prior to the implementation of the final rule  ambulance providers were not required to accept assignment and could obtain payment from medicare patients or medicare hmos for the provider s full charges  which typically are higher than the medicare rate 
when the requirement to accept assignment became effective on april   many medicare hmos continued to pay ambulance providers their full charges  even though they could have paid them the medicare rate 
many medicare hmos subsequently have taken the position that the amount paid to such providers in excess of the medicare rate constituted an overpayment that must be refunded by the provider 
we have received such refund demands from some medicare hmos and  in order to minimize litigation costs  have agreed to partial repayment of amounts received from the plans in excess of the medicare rate 
we have no reason to believe that additional hmos will make such demands  but we cannot assure you that there will be no further demands 
the snf prospective payment system 
under the medicare prospective payment system  or pps  applicable to skilled nursing facilities snf  snf s are financially responsible for some ancillary services  including certain ambulance transports  or pps transports  rendered to certain of their medicare patients 
ambulance companies must bill the snf  rather than medicare  for pps transports  but may bill medicare for other covered transports provided to the snf s medicare patients 
ambulance companies are responsible for obtaining sufficient information from the snf to determine which transports are pps transports and which ones may be billed to medicare 
the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  or the oig  has issued two industry wide audit reports indicating that  in many cases  snfs do not provide  or ambulance companies and other ancillary service providers do not obtain  sufficient information to make this determination accurately 
as a result  the oig asserts that some pps transports that should have been billed by ambulance providers to snfs have been improperly billed to medicare 
the oig has recommended that medicare recoup the amounts paid to ancillary service providers  including ambulance companies  for such services 
although we believe amr currently has procedures in place to correctly identify and bill for pps transports  we cannot assure you that amr will not be subject to such recoupments and other possible penalties 
paramedic intercepts 
medicare regulations permit ambulance transport providers to subcontract with other organizations for paramedic services 
generally  only the transport provider may bill medicare  and the paramedic services subcontractor must receive any payment to which it is entitled from that provider 
based on these rules  in some jurisdictions we have established paramedic intercept arrangements in which we may provide paramedic services to a municipal or volunteer transport provider 
our subsidiary  amr of south dakota  previously entered into a settlement agreement with the united states government arising from allegations that we improperly billed medicare for a small number of transports for which we performed paramedic intercept services  even though we were not the transport provider 
although we believe amr currently has procedures in place to assure that we do not bill medicare directly for paramedic intercept services we provide  we cannot assure you that enforcement agencies will not find that we have failed to comply with these requirements 
patient signatures 
medicare regulations require that providers obtain the signature of the patient or  if the patient is unable to provide a signature  the signature of a representative  prior to submitting a claim for payment from medicare 
an exception exists for situations where it is not reasonably possible to do so  provided that the reason for the exception is clearly documented 
this requirement historically has been difficult for ambulance companies and other emergency medical services providers to meet  because even when the patient is competent  the exigency of the situation often makes it impracticable to obtain a signature 
although we believe amr currently has procedures in place to assure that these signature requirements are met  we cannot assure you that enforcement agencies will not find that we have failed to comply with these requirements 
physician certification statements 
under applicable medicare rules  ambulance providers are required to obtain a certification of medical necessity from the ordering physician in order to bill medicare for repetitive non emergency transports provided to patients with chronic conditions  such as end stage renal disease 
for certain other non emergency transports  ambulance providers are required to attempt to obtain a certification of medical necessity from a physician or certain other practitioners 
in the event the provider is not able to obtain such certification within days  it may submit a claim for the transport if it can document reasonable attempts to obtain the certification 
acceptable documentation includes any us postal document eg  signed return receipt or postal service proof of service form showing that the ordering practitioner was sent a request for the certification 
although we believe amr currently has procedures in place to assure we are in compliance with these requirements  we cannot assure you that enforcement agencies will not find that we have failed to comply 
coordination of benefits rules 
when our services are covered by multiple third party payors  such as a primary and a secondary payor  financial responsibility must be allocated among the multiple payors in a process known as coordination of benefits  or cob 
the rules governing cob are complex  particularly when one of the payors is medicare or another government program 
under these rules  in some cases medicare or other government payors can be billed as a secondary payor only after recourse to a primary payor eg  a liability insurer has been exhausted 
in some instances  multiple payors may reimburse us an amount which  in the aggregate  exceeds the amount to which we are entitled 
in such cases  we are obligated to process a refund 
if we improperly bill medicare or other government payors as the primary payor when that program should be billed as the secondary payor  or if we fail to process a refund when required  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
although we believe we currently have procedures in place to assure that we comply with applicable cob rules  and that we process refunds when we receive overpayments  we cannot assure you that payors or enforcement agencies will not find that we have violated these requirements 
consequences of noncompliance 
in the event any of our billing and collection practices  including but not limited to those described above  violate applicable laws such as those described below  we could be subject to refund demands and recoupments 
if our violations are deemed to be willful  knowing or reckless  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties under the false claims act or other statutes  including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs 
to the extent that the complexity associated with billing for our services causes delays in our cash collections  we assume the financial risk of increased carrying costs associated with the aging of our accounts receivable as well as increased potential for bad debts which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  provision for uncompensated care and cash flow 
federal false claims act both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies  and their executives and managers 
although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare providers  a significant number of these investigations involve the federal false claims act 
these investigations can be initiated not only by the government but also by a private party asserting direct knowledge of fraud 
these qui tam whistleblower lawsuits may be initiated against any person or entity alleging such person or entity has knowingly or recklessly presented  or caused to be presented  a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government  or has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved 
penalties for false claims act violations include fines ranging from  to  for each false claim  plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government 
a false claims act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare programs 
in addition  some states have adopted similar insurance fraud  whistleblower and false claims provisions 
the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes  including the federal anti kickback statute and the stark law  described below  can be considered a violation of the federal false claims act based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws  regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement 
federal anti kickback statute we are subject to the federal anti kickback statute 
the anti kickback statute is broadly worded and prohibits the knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for  or to induce  the referral of a person covered by medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs  the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs or the purchasing  leasing or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing  leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs 
certain federal courts have held that the anti kickback statute can be violated if one purpose of a payment is to induce referrals 
violations of the anti kickback statute can result in exclusion from medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties  including fines of up to  per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration 
imposition of any of these remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to a few statutory exceptions  the oig has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute provided all applicable criteria are met 
the failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the anti kickback statute 
in order to obtain additional clarification on arrangements that may not be subject to a statutory exception or may not satisfy the criteria of a safe harbor  congress established a process under the health insurance portability and accountability act of in which parties can seek an advisory opinion from the oig 
we and others in the healthcare community have taken advantage of the advisory opinion process  and a number of advisory opinions have addressed issues that pertain to our various operations  such as discounted ambulance services being provided to skilled nursing facilities  patient co payment responsibilities  compensation methodologies under a management services arrangement  and ambulance restocking arrangements 
in a number of these advisory opinions the government concluded that such arrangements could be problematic if the requisite intent were present 
although advisory opinions are binding only on hhs and the requesting party or parties  when new advisory opinions are issued  regardless of the requestor  we review them and their application to our operations as part of our ongoing corporate compliance program and endeavor to make appropriate changes where we perceive the need to do so 
see corporate compliance program and corporate integrity obligations 
health facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes refer two categories of ambulance transports to us and other ambulance companies transports for which the facility must pay the ambulance company  and transports which the ambulance company can bill directly to medicare or other public or private payors 
in advisory opinion  which we requested  the oig addressed the issue of whether substantial contractual discounts provided to nursing homes on the transports for which the nursing homes are financially responsible may violate the anti kickback statute when the ambulance company also receives referrals of medicare and other government funded transports 
the oig opined that such discounts implicate the anti kickback statute if even one purpose of the discounts is to induce the referral of the transports paid for by medicare and other federal programs 
the oig further indicated that a violation may exist even if there is no contractual obligation on the part of the facility to refer federally funded patients  and even if similar discounts are provided by other ambulance companies in the same marketplace 
following our receipt of this advisory opinion in march of  we took steps to bring our contracts with health facilities into compliance with the oig s views 
in  we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice and a corporate integrity agreement to settle allegations that certain of our hospital and nursing home contracts in effect in texas in periods prior to contained discounts in violation of the federal anti kickback statute 
see item  legal proceedings 
the oig has also addressed potential violations of the anti kickback statute as well as other risk areas in its compliance program guidance for ambulance suppliers 
in addition to discount arrangements with health facilities  the oig notes that arrangements between local governmental agencies that control patient referrals and ambulance companies which receive such referrals may violate the anti kickback statute if the ambulance companies provide inappropriate remuneration in exchange for such referrals 
although we believe we have structured our arrangements with local agencies in a manner which complies with the anti kickback statute  we cannot assure you that enforcement agencies will not find that some of those arrangements violate that statute 
fee splitting  corporate practice of medicine emcare employs or contracts with physicians or physician owned professional corporations to deliver services to our hospital customers and their patients 
we frequently enter into management services contracts with these physicians and professional corporations pursuant to which we provide them with billing  scheduling and a wide range of other services  and they pay us for those services out of the fees they collect from patients and third party payors 
these activities are subject to various state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by corporations and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician s professional judgment and the sharing of professional services income with nonprofessional or business interests 
activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states 
under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states  decisions and activities such as scheduling  contracting  setting rates and the hiring and management of non clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on corporate practice of medicine 
in such states  we maintain long term management contracts with affiliated physician groups  which employ or contract with physicians to provide physician services 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable state laws relating to the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting 
however  regulatory authorities or other parties  including our affiliated physicians  may assert that  despite these arrangements  we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting 
in this event  we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative interpretations  to civil or criminal penalties  our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements with our affiliated physician groups 
federal stark law we are also subject to a provision of the social security act  commonly known as the stark law 
where applicable  this law prohibits a physician from referring medicare patients to an entity providing designated health services if the physician or a member of such physician s immediate family has a financial relationship with the entity  unless an exception applies 
the penalties for violating the stark law include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute  mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services  civil penalties of up to  for each violation and twice the dollar value of each such service and possible exclusion from future participation in the federally funded healthcare programs 
a person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the stark law s prohibitions may be fined up to  for each applicable arrangement or scheme 
although we believe that we have structured our agreements with physicians so as to not violate the stark law and related regulations  a determination of liability under the stark law could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws we are also subject to other federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws 
under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  there are two additional federal crimes that could have an impact on our business healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters 
the healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program  including private payors 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines  imprisonment and or exclusion from government sponsored programs 
the false statements relating to healthcare matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick  scheme or device or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits  items or services 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and or imprisonment 
this statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment 
another statute  commonly referred to as the civil monetary penalties law  imposes civil administrative sanctions for  among other violations  inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs  inappropriately reducing hospital care lengths of stay for such patients  and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs 
although we intend and endeavor to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable fraud and abuse laws  we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws 
administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  required the department of health and human services  or hhs  to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of health related information 
all healthcare providers were required to be compliant with the new federal privacy requirements enacted by hhs no later than april  we believe we have taken reasonable measures to comply with these requirements 
the hipaa privacy requirements contain detailed requirements regarding the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information 
improper use or disclosure of identifiable health information covered by the hipaa privacy regulations can result in the following civil and criminal penalties civil money penalties for hipaa privacy violations are per incident  to a maximum of  per person  per year  per standard violated  a person who knowingly and in violation of the hipaa privacy regulations obtains individually identifiable health information or discloses such information to another person may be fined up to  and imprisoned up to one year  or both  if the offense is committed under false pretenses  the fine may be up to  and imprisonment for up to five years  and if the offense is done with the intent to sell  transfer or use individually identifiable health information for commercial advantage  personal gain or malicious harm  the fine may be up to  and imprisonment for up to ten years 
in addition to enacting the foregoing privacy requirements  hhs issued a final rule creating security requirements for healthcare providers and other covered entities on february  the final security rule required covered entities to meet specified standards by april  the security standards contained in the final rule do not require the use of specific technologies eg  no specific hardware or software is required  but instead require healthcare providers and other covered entities to comply with certain minimum security procedures in order to protect data integrity  confidentiality and availability 
we believe we have taken reasonable steps to comply with these standards 
hipaa also required hhs to adopt national standards establishing electronic transaction standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically 
although these standards were to become effective october  congress extended the compliance deadline until october for organizations  such as ours  that submitted a request for an extension 
we believe we have taken reasonable steps to comply with these standards 
fair debt collection practices act some of our operations may be subject to compliance with certain provisions of the fair debt collection practices act and comparable statutes in many states 
under the fair debt collection practices act  a third party collection company is restricted in the methods it uses to contact consumer debtors and elicit payments with respect to placed accounts 
requirements under state collection agency statutes vary  with most requiring compliance similar to that required under the fair debt collection practices act 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with the fair debt collection practices act and comparable state statutes where applicable 
state fraud and abuse provisions we are subject to state fraud and abuse statutes and regulations 
most of the states in which we operate have adopted a form of anti kickback law  almost all of those states also have adopted self referral laws and some have adopted separate false claims or insurance fraud provisions 
the scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
generally  state laws cover all healthcare services and not just those covered under a federally funded healthcare program 
a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions 
although we intend and endeavor to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable fraud and abuse laws  we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws 
licensing  certification  accreditation and related laws and guidelines in certain jurisdictions  changes in our ownership structure require pre or post notification to governmental licensing and certification agencies 
relevant laws and regulations may also require reapplication and approval to maintain or renew our operating authorities or require formal application and approval to continue providing services under certain government contracts 
for example  in connection with our acquisition of amr from laidlaw  two of our subsidiaries were required to apply for state and local ambulance operating authority in new york 
see item a  risk factors risk factors related to healthcare regulation changes in our ownership structure and operations require us to comply with numerous notification and reapplication requirements in order to maintain our licensure  certification or other authority to operate  and failure to do so  or an allegation that we have failed to do so  can result in payment delays  forfeiture of payment or civil and criminal penalties 
we and our affiliated physicians are subject to various federal  state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations and accreditation standards and other laws  relating to  among other things  the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel and operating policies and procedures 
we are also subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in our services being found to be non reimbursable or prior payments being subject to recoupment  and can give rise to civil or criminal penalties 
we have taken steps we believe were required to retain or obtain all requisite licensure and operating authorities 
while we have made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with federal  state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations and standards as we interpret them  we cannot assure you that agencies that administer these programs will not find that we have failed to comply in some material respects 
because we perform services at hospitals and other types of healthcare facilities  we and our affiliated physicians may be subject to laws which are applicable to those entities 
for example  our operations are impacted by the emergency medical treatment and active labor act of  which prohibits patient dumping by requiring hospitals and hospital emergency departments and others to assess and stabilize any patient presenting to the hospital s emergency department or urgent care center requesting care for an emergency medical condition  regardless of the patient s ability to pay 
many states in which we operate have similar state law provisions concerning patient dumping 
violations of the emergency medical treatment and active labor act of can result in civil penalties and exclusion of the offending physician from the medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition to the emergency medical treatment and active labor act of and its state law equivalents  significant aspects of our operations are affected by state and federal statutes and regulations governing workplace health and safety  dispensing of controlled substances and the disposal of medical waste 
changes in ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional and trade associations and private accreditation commissions such as the american medical association and the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations may also affect our operations 
we believe our operations as currently conducted are in substantial compliance with these laws and guidelines 
emcare s professional liability insurance program  under which insurance is provided for most of our affiliated medical professionals and professional and corporate entities  is reinsured through our wholly owned subsidiary  emca insurance company  ltd 
the activities associated with the business of insurance  and the companies involved in such activities  are closely regulated 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in civil and criminal fines and penalties and loss of licensure 
while we have made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with these laws and regulations  and utilize licensed insurance professionals where necessary and appropriate  we cannot assure you that we will not be found to have violated these laws and regulations in some material respects 
antitrust laws antitrust laws such as the sherman act and state counterparts prohibit anticompetitive conduct by separate competitors  such as price fixing or the division of markets 
our physician contracts include contracts with individual physicians and with physicians organized as separate legal professional entities eg  professional medical corporations 
antitrust laws may deem each such physician entity to be separate  both from emcare and from each other and  accordingly  each such physician practice is subject to antitrust laws that prohibit anti competitive conduct between or among separate legal entities or individuals 
although we believe we have structured our physician contracts to substantially comply with these laws  we cannot assure you that antitrust regulatory agencies or a court would not find us to be non compliant 
corporate compliance program and corporate integrity obligations we have developed a corporate compliance program in an effort to monitor compliance with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to healthcare entities  to ensure that we maintain high standards of conduct in the operation of our business and to implement policies and procedures so that employees act in compliance with all applicable laws  regulations and company policies 
our program also attempts to monitor compliance with our corporate compliance plan  which details our standards for business ethics  compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws  and business conduct 
we have an ethics and compliance department whose focus is to prevent  detect and mitigate regulatory risks 
we attempt to accomplish this mission through providing guidance  education and proper controls based on the regulatory risks associated with our business model and strategic plan  conducting internal audits and reviews to identify any improper practices that may be occurring  resolving regulatory matters  and enhancing the ethical culture and leadership of the organization 
the oig has issued a series of compliance program guidance documents in which the oig has set out the elements of an effective compliance program 
we believe our compliance program has been structured appropriately in light of this guidance 
the primary compliance program components recommended by the oig  all of which we have attempted to implement  include formal policies and written procedures  designation of a compliance officer  education and training programs  internal monitoring and reviews  responding appropriately to detected misconduct  open lines of communication  and discipline and accountability 
our corporate compliance program is based on the overall goal of promoting a culture that encourages employees to conduct activities with integrity  dignity and care for those we serve  and in compliance with all applicable laws and policies 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we audit compliance with our compliance program on a sample basis 
although such an approach reflects a reasonable and accepted approach in the industry  we cannot assure you that our program will detect and rectify all compliance issues in all markets and for all time periods 
as do other healthcare companies which operate effective compliance programs  from time to time we identify practices that may have resulted in medicare or medicaid overpayments or other regulatory issues 
for example  we have previously identified situations in which we may have inadvertently utilized incorrect billing codes for some of the services we have billed to government programs such as medicare or medicaid  or billed for services which may not meet medical necessity guidelines 
in such cases  if appropriate  it is our practice to disclose the issue to the affected government programs and to refund any resulting overpayments 
the government usually accepts such disclosures and repayments without taking further enforcement action  and we generally expect that to be the case with respect to our past and future disclosures and repayments 
however  it is possible that such disclosures or repayments will result in allegations by the government that we have violated the false claims act or other laws  leading to investigations and possibly civil or criminal enforcement actions 
when the united states government settles a case involving allegations of billing misconduct with a healthcare provider  it typically requires the provider to enter into a corporate integrity agreement  or cia  with the oig for a set period of years 
as a condition to settlement of government investigations  certain of our operations are subject to two separate cias with the oig for the period july through september as part of these cias  amr is required to establish and maintain a compliance program that includes the following elements a compliance officer and committee  written standards including a code of conduct and policies and procedures  general and specific training and education  claims review by an independent review organization  disclosure program for reporting of compliance issues or questions  screening and removal processes for ineligible persons  notification of government investigations or legal proceedings  establishment of safeguards applicable to our contracting processes and reporting of overpayments and other reportable events 
in addition to these cias  one of our other operations recently completed the term of a three year cia 
if we fail or if we are accused of failing to comply with the terms of our existing cias  we may be subject to additional litigation or other government actions  including being excluded from participating in the medicare program and other federal healthcare programs 
if we enter into any settlements with the us government in the future we may be required to enter into additional cias

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the factors described below  in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report  when evaluating us and our business 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risk factors related to our capital structure the interests of our controlling stockholders may conflict with interests of other stockholders 
onex partners lp and other entities affiliated with onex corporation  which we refer to together as the onex entities  own all of our outstanding lp exchangeable units  which are exchangeable at any time  at the option of the holder  for our class b common stock 
our class a common stock has one vote per share  while our class b common stock has ten votes per share reducing to one vote per share under certain limited circumstances  on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders 
prior to the exchange for class b common stock  the holders of the lp exchangeable units will be able to exercise the same voting rights with respect to emergency medical services as they would have after the exchange through a share of class b special voting stock 
as a result  the onex entities control approximately of our combined voting power 
accordingly  the onex entities exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs and have the power to determine all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders  including the election of directors  the removal of directors  and approval of significant corporate transactions such as amendments to our certificate of incorporation  mergers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
the onex entities could cause corporate actions to be taken even if the interests of these entities conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 
this concentration of voting power could have the effect of deterring or preventing a change in control of emergency medical services that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
gerald w 
schwartz  the chairman  president and chief executive officer of onex corporation  owns shares representing a majority of the voting rights of the shares of onex corporation 
onex has the voting power to elect our entire board of directors and to remove any director or our entire board without cause 
although our current board includes independent directors  so long as the onex entities control more than of our combined voting power we are exempt from the nyse rule that requires that a board be comprised of a majority of independent directors 
onex may have a controlling influence over our board  as onex has sufficient voting power to elect the entire board  and our certificate of incorporation permits stockholders to remove directors at any time with or without cause 
as a holding company  our only material asset is our equity interest in ems lp and our only source of revenue is distributions from ems lp 
because the onex entities have the voting power to control our board of directors  they could influence us  as the general partner of ems lp  to take action at the level of ems lp that would benefit the onex entities and conflict with the interest of our class a stockholders 
we are a holding company  and we have no material assets other than our direct ownership of a equity interest in ems lp 
ems lp is our only source of cash flow from operations 
the onex entities hold their equity interest in us through lp exchangeable units of ems lp 
as our controlling stockholder  onex could limit distributions to us from ems lp  and cause us to amend the ems lp partnership agreement in a manner that would be beneficial to the onex entities  as limited partners of ems lp  and detrimental to our class a stockholders 
any decrease in our distributions from ems lp would have a negative effect on our cash flow 
in order to minimize this conflict  the ems lp partnership agreement requires that the partnership reimburse us for all of our expenses  including all employee costs and the expenses we incur as a public company  and provides further that no distributions may be made to the onex entities  as the holders of lp exchangeable units  unless we pay an economically equivalent dividend to all holders of our common stock 
the ems lp partnership agreement provides that amendments to that agreement may only be proposed and authorized by us  as the general partner 
the onex entities could seek to influence our board s action with respect to any amendment and we  as the general partner of ems lp  owe a fiduciary duty to the limited partners of the partnership 
our board also owes a fiduciary duty to our common stockholders 
because of the inherent conflict of interest we face between our fiduciary duty to our stockholders  including our class a stockholders  and the onex entities  as limited partners in ems lp  the ems lp partnership agreement provides that  if there is any conflict of interest of the limited partners and our common stockholders  our board may  in the exercise of its business judgment  cause us to act in the best interests of our stockholders 
we are party to a management agreement with an affiliate of onex which permits us to increase substantially the fee we pay to that affiliate 
the management agreement between our subsidiaries  amr and emcare  and an onex affiliate provides that the annual fee may be increased from million to million  which amount represents a significant percentage of our net income 
such an increase would be detrimental to the interest of our class a stockholders if the fee were disproportionate to the benefit we derive from the services the onex affiliate performs 
in order to minimize this potential conflict of interest  the agreement requires that any increase in the fee be approved by a majority of the members of the boards of amr and emcare who are not affiliated with onex 
as long as the onex entities control more than of our combined voting power  they may be able to exercise a controlling influence over the election of the boards of amr and emcare 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business 
we have a substantial amount of debt 
at december   we had total debt of million  including million of borrowings under the term loan portion of our senior secured credit facility  million of our senior subordinated notes and million of capital lease obligations 
we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we had million of letters of credit outstanding 
in addition  subject to restrictions in the indenture governing our notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility  we may incur additional debt 
our substantial debt could have important consequences to you  including the following it may be difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  including debt service requirements under our outstanding debt  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a significant portion of our cash flow for payments on our debt  which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes  we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business or industry is more limited  our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures  as compared to our competitors  may be compromised due to our high level of debt  and our ability to borrow additional funds or to refinance debt may be limited 
furthermore  all of our debt under our senior secured credit facility bears interest at variable rates 
if these rates were to increase significantly  our ability to borrow additional funds may be reduced and the risks related to our substantial debt would intensify 
servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on numerous factors beyond our control  and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities 
the cash we require to meet contractual obligations in  including our debt service  will total approximately million 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
to some extent  this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
lower net revenues  or higher provision for uncollectibles  generally will reduce our cash flow 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt  sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital 
we cannot assure you that we could effect any of these actions on a timely basis  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  or that these actions would be sufficient to meet our capital requirements 
in addition  the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives 
restrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limit our ability  among other things  to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock  pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders  repurchase or redeem our capital  make investments  incur liens  make capital expenditures  enter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates  sell certain assets  acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies  and incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions or transfer assets to us 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants  alternative sources of financing or reductions in expenditures 
we cannot assure you that such waivers  amendments or alternative financings could be obtained  or  if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility requires us to meet certain financial ratios and restricts our ability to make capital expenditures or prepay certain other debt 
we may not be able to maintain these ratios  and the restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restrict corporate activities 
if a breach of any covenant or restriction contained in our financing agreements results in an event of default  those lenders could discontinue lending  accelerate the related debt which would accelerate other debt and declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable 
in addition  the lenders could terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with additional funds 
in the event of an acceleration of our debt  we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated debt payments 
our obligations under our senior secured credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets 
our obligations under our senior secured credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets  and the guarantees of our subsidiaries under our senior secured credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of those subsidiaries assets 
if we become insolvent or are liquidated  or if payment under our senior secured credit facility or of other secured obligations are accelerated  the lenders under our senior secured credit facility or the obligees with respect to the other secured obligations will be entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured lender under applicable law and the applicable agreements and instruments  including the right to foreclose on all of our assets 
risk factors related to our business we could be subject to lawsuits for which we are not fully reserved 
in recent years  physicians  hospitals and other participants in the healthcare industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging medical malpractice and related legal theories such as negligent hiring  supervision and credentialing 
similarly  ambulance transport services may result in lawsuits concerning vehicle collisions and personal injuries  patient care incidents and employee job related injuries 
some of these lawsuits may involve large claim amounts and substantial defense costs 
emcare procures professional liability insurance coverage for most of its affiliated medical professionals and professional and corporate entities 
beginning january   this insurance coverage has been provided by affiliates of cna insurance company  which then reinsure the entire program  primarily through emcare s wholly owned subsidiary  emca insurance company  ltd  or emca 
workers compensation coverage for emcare s employees and applicable affiliated medical professionals is provided under a similar structure for the period 
from september  to the closing date of our acquisition of amr and emcare  amr obtained insurance coverage for losses with respect to workers compensation  auto and general liability claims through laidlaw s captive insurance company 
amr currently has a self insurance program fronted by an unrelated third party 
amr retains the risk of loss under this coverage 
under these insurance programs  we establish reserves  using actuarial estimates  for all losses covered under the policies 
moreover  in the normal course of our business  we are involved in lawsuits  claims  audits and investigations  including those arising out of our billing and marketing practices  employment disputes  contractual claims and other business disputes for which we may have no insurance coverage  and which are not subject to actuarial estimates 
the outcome of these matters could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period when we identify the matter  and the ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
our liability to pay for emcare s insurance program losses is collateralized by funds held through emca and  to the extent these losses exceed the collateral and assets of emca or the limits of our insurance policies  will have to be funded by us 
should our amr losses with respect to such claims exceed the collateral held by laidlaw in connection with our self insurance program or the limits of our insurance policies  we will have to fund such amounts 
see item  business american medical response insurance and business emcare insurance 
the reserves we establish with respect to our losses covered under our insurance programs are subject to inherent uncertainties 
in connection with our insurance programs  we establish reserves for losses and related expenses  which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections  at a given point in time  of our expectations of the ultimate resolution and administration costs of losses we have incurred in respect of our liability risks 
insurance reserves inherently are subject to uncertainty 
our reserves are based on historical claims  demographic factors  industry trends  severity and exposure factors and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent actuary firm 
the independent actuary firm performs studies of projected ultimate losses on an annual basis and provides quarterly updates to those projections 
we use these actuarial estimates to determine appropriate reserves 
our reserves could be significantly affected if current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations 
while we monitor claims closely when we estimate reserves  the complexity of the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes may hamper timely adjustments to the assumptions we use in these estimates 
actual losses and related expenses may deviate  individually and in the aggregate  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
if we determine that our estimated reserves are inadequate  we will be required to increase reserves at the time of the determination  which would result in a reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is determined 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies claims liability and professional liability reserves and note of the notes to our financial statements included in item insurance coverage for some of our losses may be inadequate and may be subject to the credit risk of commercial insurance companies 
some of our insurance coverage  for periods prior to the initiation of our self insurance programs as well as portions of our current insurance coverage  is through various third party insurers 
to the extent we hold policies to cover certain groups of claims  but either did not obtain sufficient insurance limits  did not buy an extended reporting period policy  where applicable  or the issuing insurance company is no longer viable  we may be responsible for losses attributable to such claims 
furthermore  for our losses that are insured or reinsured through commercial insurance companies  we are subject to the credit risk of those insurance companies 
while we believe our commercial insurance company providers currently are creditworthy  there can be no assurance that such insurance companies will remain so in the future 
we are subject to decreases in our revenue and profit margin under our fee for service contracts  where we bear the risk of changes in volume  payor mix and third party reimbursement rates 
in our fee for service arrangements  which generated approximately of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended december   we  or our affiliated physicians  collect the fees for transports and physician services 
under these arrangements  we assume financial risks related to changes in the mix of insured and uninsured patients and patients covered by government sponsored healthcare programs  third party reimbursement rates and transports and patient volume 
in some cases our revenue decreases if our volume or reimbursement decreases  but our expenses may not decrease proportionately 
see risk factors related to healthcare regulation changes in the rates or methods of third party reimbursements may adversely affect our revenue and operations 
in addition  fee for service contracts have less favorable cash flow characteristics in the start up phase than traditional flat rate contracts due to longer collection periods 
we collect a smaller portion of our fees for services rendered to uninsured patients than for services rendered to insured patients 
our credit risk related to services provided to uninsured individuals is exacerbated because the law requires communities to provide emergency response services and hospital emergency departments to treat all patients presenting to the emergency department seeking care for an emergency medical condition regardless of their ability to pay 
we also believe uninsured patients are more likely to seek care at hospital emergency departments because they frequently do not have a primary care physician with whom to consult 
we may not be able to successfully recruit and retain physicians and other healthcare professionals with the qualifications and attributes desired by us and our customers 
our ability to recruit and retain affiliated physicians and other healthcare professionals significantly affects our performance under our contracts 
in the recent past  our customer hospitals have increasingly demanded a greater degree of specialized skills  training and experience in the healthcare professionals providing services under their contracts with us 
this decreases the number of healthcare professionals who may be permitted to staff our contracts 
moreover  because of the scope of the geographic and demographic diversity of the hospitals and other facilities with which we contract  we must recruit healthcare professionals  and particularly physicians  to staff a broad spectrum of contracts 
we have had difficulty in the past recruiting physicians to staff contracts in some regions of the country and at some less economically advantaged hospitals 
moreover  we compete with other entities to recruit and retain qualified physicians and other healthcare professionals to deliver clinical services 
our future success in retaining and winning new hospital contracts depends on our ability to recruit and retain healthcare professionals to maintain and expand our operations 
our non compete agreements and other restrictive covenants involving physicians may not be enforceable 
we have contracts with physicians and professional corporations in many states 
some of these contracts  as well as our contracts with hospitals  include provisions preventing these physicians and professional corporations from competing with us both during and after the term of our relationship with them 
the law governing non compete agreements and other forms of restrictive covenants varies from state to state 
some states are reluctant to strictly enforce non compete agreements and restrictive covenants applicable to physicians 
there can be no assurance that our non compete agreements related to affiliated physicians and professional corporations will not be successfully challenged as unenforceable in certain states 
in such event  we would be unable to prevent former affiliated physicians and professional corporations from competing with us  potentially resulting in the loss of some of our hospital contracts 
we are required to make significant capital expenditures for our ambulance services business in order to remain competitive 
our capital expenditure requirements primarily relate to maintaining and upgrading our vehicle fleet and medical equipment to serve our customers and remain competitive 
the aging of our vehicle fleet requires us to make regular capital expenditures to maintain our current level of service 
our capital expenditures totaled million in the year ended december   and million in the eleven months ended december  in addition  changing competitive conditions or the emergence of any significant advances in medical technology could require us to invest significant capital in additional equipment or capacity in order to remain competitive 
if we are unable to fund any such investment or otherwise fail to invest in new vehicles or medical equipment  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on our senior management and may not be able to retain those employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
we depend on our senior management 
the loss of services of any of the members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement can be found 
there may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions  and we cannot assure you that we would be able to identify or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms 
our revenue would be adversely affected if we lose existing contracts 
a significant portion of our growth historically has resulted from increases in the number of emergency and non emergency transports  and the number of patient visits and fees for services we provide under existing contracts  and the addition of new contracts 
substantially all of our net revenue in the twelve months ended december  was generated under contracts  including exclusive contracts that accounted for approximately of our fiscal net revenue 
our contracts with hospitals generally have terms of three years and the term of our contracts with communities to provide services generally ranges from three to five years 
most of our contracts are terminable by either of the parties upon notice of as little as days 
any of our contracts may not be renewed or  if renewed  may contain terms that are not as favorable to us as our current contracts 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining our existing contracts or that any loss of contracts would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  certain of our contracts will expire during each fiscal period  and we may be required to seek renewal of these contracts through a formal bidding process that often requires written responses to a request for proposal rfp 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining such contracts or that we will retain them on terms that are as favorable as present terms 
we may not accurately assess the costs we will incur under new contracts 
our new contracts increasingly involve a competitive bidding process 
when we obtain new contracts  we must accurately assess the costs we will incur in providing services in order to realize adequate profit margins and otherwise meet our financial and strategic objectives 
increasing pressures from healthcare payors to restrict or reduce reimbursement rates at a time when the costs of providing medical services continue to increase make assessing the costs associated with the pricing of new contracts  as well as maintenance of existing contracts  more difficult 
in addition  integrating new contracts  particularly those in new geographic locations  could prove more costly  and could require more management time  than we anticipate 
our failure to accurately predict costs or to negotiate an adequate profit margin could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the high level of competition in our segments of the market for emergency medical services could adversely affect our contract and revenue base 
amr 
the market for providing ambulance transport services to municipalities  other healthcare providers and third party payors is highly competitive 
in providing ambulance transport services  we compete with governmental entities including cities and fire districts  hospitals  local and volunteer private providers  and with several large national and regional providers  such as rural metro corporation  southwest ambulance and acadian ambulance 
in many communities  our most important competitors are the local fire departments  which in many cases have acted traditionally as the first response providers during emergencies  and have been able to expand their scope of services to include emergency ambulance transport and do not wish to give up their franchises to a private competitor 
emcare 
the market for providing outsourced physician staffing and related management services to hospitals and clinics is highly competitive 
such competition could adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts  retain existing contracts and increase or maintain profit margins 
we compete with both national and regional enterprises such as team health  sterling healthcare  the schumacher group and national emergency services healthcare group  some of which may have greater financial and other resources available to them  greater access to physicians and or greater access to potential customers 
we also compete against local physician groups and self operated hospital emergency departments for satisfying staffing and scheduling needs 
our business depends on numerous complex information systems  and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm our operations 
we depend on complex  integrated information systems and standardized procedures for operational and financial information and our billing operations 
we may not have the necessary resources to enhance existing information systems or implement new systems where necessary to handle our volume and changing needs 
furthermore  we may experience unanticipated delays  complications and expenses in implementing  integrating and operating our systems  including the integration of our amr and emcare systems 
any interruptions in operations during periods of implementation would adversely affect our ability to properly allocate resources and process billing information in a timely manner  which could result in customer dissatisfaction and delayed cash flow 
we also use the development and implementation of sophisticated and specialized technology to differentiate our services from our competitors and improve our profitability 
the failure to successfully implement and maintain operational  financial and billing information systems could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain new business  retain existing business and maintain or increase our profit margins 
if we fail to implement our business strategy  our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
our business strategy envisions several initiatives  including increasing revenue from existing customers  growing our customer base  pursuing select acquisitions  implementing cost rationalization initiatives  focusing on risk mitigation and utilizing technology to differentiate our services and improve profitability 
we may not be able to implement our business strategy successfully or achieve the anticipated benefits of our business plan 
if we are unable to do so  our long term growth and profitability may be adversely affected 
even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business plan successfully  our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate  or at all 
implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  such as increased competition  legal developments  government regulation  general economic conditions or increased operating costs or expenses 
in addition  to the extent we have misjudged the nature and extent of industry trends or our competition  we may have difficulty in achieving our strategic objectives 
any failure to implement our business strategy successfully may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and thus our ability to service our debt 
in addition  we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time 
a successful challenge by tax authorities to our treatment of certain physicians as independent contractors could require us to pay past taxes and penalties 
as of december   we contracted with approximately  physicians as independent contractors to fulfill our contractual obligations to customers 
because we treat them as independent contractors rather than as employees  we do not i withhold federal or state income or other employment related taxes from the compensation that we pay to them  ii make federal or state unemployment tax or federal insurance contributions act payments except as described below  iii provide workers compensation insurance with respect to such affiliated physicians except in states that require us to do so even for independent contractors  or iv allow them to participate in benefits and retirement programs available to employed physicians 
our contracts with our independent contractor physicians obligate these physicians to pay these taxes and other costs 
whether these physicians are properly classified as independent contractors depends upon the facts and circumstances of our relationship with them 
it is possible that the nature of our relationship with these physicians would support a challenge to our classification of them 
if such a challenge by federal or state taxing authorities were successful  and the physicians at issue were instead treated as employees  we could be adversely affected and liable for past taxes and penalties to the extent that the physicians did not fulfill their contractual obligations to pay those taxes 
under current federal tax law  however  even if our treatment were successfully challenged  if our current treatment were found to be consistent with a long standing practice of a significant segment of our industry and we meet certain other requirements  it is possible but not certain that our treatment of the physicians would qualify under a safe harbor and  consequently  we would be protected from the imposition of past taxes and penalties 
in the recent past  however  there have been proposals to eliminate the safe harbor and similar proposals could be made in the future 
we may make acquisitions which could divert the attention of management and which may not be integrated successfully into our existing business 
we may pursue acquisitions to increase our market penetration  enter new geographic markets and expand the scope of services we provide 
we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates  that acquisitions will be completed on acceptable terms  that our due diligence process will uncover all potential liabilities or issues affecting our integration process  or that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations of any acquired business into our existing business 
furthermore  acquisitions into new geographic markets and services may require us to comply with new and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements  which could impose substantial obligations on us and our management  cause us to expend additional time and resources  and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non compliance with such requirements 
the acquisitions could be of significant size and involve operations in multiple jurisdictions 
the acquisition and integration of another business would divert management attention from other business activities 
this diversion  together with other difficulties we may incur in integrating an acquired business  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may borrow money or issue capital stock to finance acquisitions 
such borrowings might not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowing terms and may increase our leverage  and the issuance of capital stock could dilute the interests of our stockholders 
if laidlaw is unwilling or unable to satisfy any indemnification claims made by us pursuant to the purchase agreements relating to the acquisition of amr and emcare  we will be forced to satisfy such claims ourselves 
laidlaw has agreed to indemnify us for certain claims or legal actions brought against us arising out of the operations of amr and emcare prior to the closing date of the acquisition 
if we make a claim against laidlaw  and laidlaw is unwilling or unable to satisfy such claim  we would be required to satisfy the claim ourselves and  as a result  our financial condition may be adversely affected 
many of our employees are represented by labor unions and any work stoppage could adversely affect our business 
approximately of amr s employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements 
twenty five of these collective bargaining agreements  representing approximately  employees  are subject to renegotiation in although we believe our relations with our employees are good  we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable 
risk factors related to healthcare regulation we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations  we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
the healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal  state and local governments 
comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services  our contractual relationships with our physicians and customers  our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations 
failure to comply with these laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines  damages and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
the risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts  and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations 
any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations  even if we successfully defend against it  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business 
our practitioners and our customers are also subject to ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional and trade associations and private accreditation agencies 
compliance with these guidelines and standards is often required by our contracts with our customers or to maintain our reputation 
the laws  regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future 
we cannot assure you that any new or changed healthcare laws  regulations or standards will not materially adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure you that a review of our business by judicial  law enforcement  regulatory or accreditation authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations 
we are subject to comprehensive and complex laws and rules that govern the manner in which we bill and are paid for our services by third party payors  and the failure to comply with these rules  or allegations that we have failed to do so  can result in civil or criminal sanctions  including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs 
like most healthcare providers  the majority of our services are paid for by private and governmental third party payors  such as medicare and medicaid 
these third party payors typically have differing and complex billing and documentation requirements that we must meet in order to receive payment for our services 
reimbursement to us is typically conditioned on our providing the correct procedure and diagnostic codes and properly documenting the services themselves  including the level of service provided  the medical necessity for the services  and the identity of the practitioner who provided the service 
we must also comply with numerous other laws applicable to our documentation and the claims we submit for payment  including but not limited to coordination of benefits rules that dictate which payor we must bill first when a patient has potential coverage from multiple payors  requirements that we obtain the signature of the patient or patient representative  when possible  or document why we are unable to do so  prior to submitting a claim  requirements that we make repayment to any payor which pays us more than the amount to which we are entitled  requirements that we bill a hospital or nursing home  rather than medicare  for certain ambulance transports provided to medicare patients of such facilities  reassignment rules governing our ability to bill and collect professional fees on behalf of our physicians  requirements that our electronic claims for payment be submitted using certain standardized transaction codes and formats  and laws requiring us to handle all health and financial information of our patients in a manner that complies with specified security and privacy standards 
see item  business regulatory matters medicare  medicaid and other government reimbursement programs 
governmental and private third party payors and other enforcement agencies carefully audit and monitor our compliance with these and other applicable rules  and in some cases in the past have found that we were not in compliance 
we have received in the past  and expect to receive in the future  repayment demands from third party payors based on allegations that our services were not medically necessary  were billed at an improper level  or otherwise violated applicable billing requirements 
see item  legal proceedings 
our failure to comply with the billing and other rules applicable to us could result in non payment for services rendered or refunds of amounts previously paid for such services 
in addition  non compliance with these rules may cause us to incur civil and criminal penalties  including fines  imprisonment and exclusion from government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid  under a number of state and federal laws 
these laws include the federal false claims act  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  the federal anti kickback statute  the balanced budget act of and other provisions of federal  state and local law 
in addition  from time to time we self identify practices that may have resulted in medicare or medicaid overpayments or other regulatory issues 
for example  we have previously identified situations in which we may have inadvertently utilized incorrect billing codes for some of the services we have billed to government programs such as medicare or medicaid 
in such cases  if appropriate  it is our practice to disclose the issue to the affected government programs and to refund any resulting overpayments 
although the government usually accepts such disclosures and repayments without taking further enforcement action  it is possible that such disclosures or repayments will result in allegations by the government that we have violated the false claims act or other laws  leading to investigations and possibly civil or criminal enforcement actions 
see item  business regulatory matters corporate compliance program and corporate integrity obligations 
if our operations are found to be in violation of these or any of the other laws which govern our activities  any resulting penalties  damages  fines or other sanctions could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
see item  business regulatory matters federal false claims act and business other healthcare fraud and abuse laws 
changes in the rates or methods of third party reimbursements may adversely affect our revenue and operations 
we derive a majority of our revenue from direct billings to patients and third party payors such as medicare  medicaid and private health insurance companies 
as a result  any changes in the rates or methods of reimbursement for the services we provide could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and financial results 
government funding for healthcare programs is subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations of policy and determinations by intermediaries and governmental funding restrictions  all of which could materially impact program coverage and reimbursements for both ambulance and physician services 
in recent years  congress has consistently attempted to curb spending on medicare  medicaid and other programs funded in whole or part by the federal government 
state and local governments have also attempted to curb spending on those programs for which they are wholly or partly responsible 
this has resulted in cost containment measures such as the imposition of new fee schedules that have lowered reimbursement for some of our services and restricted the rate of increase for others  and new utilization controls that limit coverage of our services 
for example  we estimate that the impact of a national fee schedule promulgated in  as modified by subsequent legislation  resulted in a decrease in amr s net revenue for fiscal of approximately million  resulted in an increase in amr s net revenue of approximately million for calendar  and resulted in a decrease in amr s net revenue of approximately million in based upon the current medicare transport mix  we expect a further decrease in our net revenue totaling approximately million for the period through see item  business regulatory matters medicare  medicaid and other government reimbursement programs 
in addition  state and local government regulations or administrative policies regulate ambulance rate structures in some jurisdictions in which we conduct transport services 
we may be unable to receive ambulance service rate increases on a timely basis where rates are regulated  or to establish or maintain satisfactory rate structures where rates are not regulated 
we believe that regulatory trends in cost containment will continue 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to offset reduced operating margins through cost reductions  increased volume  the introduction of additional procedures or otherwise 
in addition  we cannot assure you that federal  state and local governments will not impose reductions in the fee schedules or rate regulations applicable to our services in the future 
any such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if current or future laws or regulations force us to restructure our arrangements with physicians  professional corporations and hospitals  we may incur additional costs  lose contracts and suffer a reduction in net revenue under existing contracts  and we may need to refinance our debt or obtain debt holder consent 
a number of laws bear on our contractual relationships with our physicians 
there is a risk that state authorities in some jurisdictions may find that these contractual relationships violate laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting prohibitions 
these laws prohibit the practice of medicine by general business corporations and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons or entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing the physician s professional judgment 
they may also prevent the sharing of professional services income with non professional or business interests 
from time to time  including recently  we have been involved in litigation in which private litigants have raised these issues 
see item  business regulatory matters fee splitting  corporate practice of medicine 
our physician contracts include contracts with individual physicians and with physicians organized as separate legal professional entities eg  professional medical corporations 
antitrust laws may deem each such physician entity to be separate  both from emcare and from each other and  accordingly  each such physician practice is subject to a wide range of laws that prohibit anti competitive conduct between or among separate legal entities or individuals 
a review or action by regulatory authorities or the courts could force us to terminate or modify our contractual relationships with physicians and affiliated medical groups or revise them in a manner that could be materially adverse to our business 
see item  business regulatory matters antitrust laws 
various licensing and certification laws  regulations and standards apply to us  our affiliated physicians and our relationships with our affiliated physicians 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in our services being found to be non reimbursable or prior payments being subject to recoupment  and can give rise to civil or criminal penalties 
we are pursuing steps we believe we must take to retain or obtain all requisite licensure and operating authorities 
while we have made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with federal  state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations and standards as we interpret them  we cannot assure you that agencies that administer these programs will not find that we have failed to comply in some material respects 
emcare s professional liability insurance program  under which insurance is provided for most of our affiliated medical professionals and professional and corporate entities  is reinsured through our wholly owned subsidiary  emca insurance company  ltd 
the activities associated with the business of insurance  and the companies involved in such activities  are closely regulated 
failure to comply with the laws and regulations can result in civil and criminal fines and penalties and loss of licensure 
while we have made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with these laws and regulations  and utilize licensed insurance professionals where necessary and appropriate  we cannot assure you that we will not be found to have violated these laws and regulations in some material respects 
adverse judicial or administrative interpretations could result in a finding that we are not in compliance with one or more of these laws and rules that affect our relationships with our physicians 
these laws and rules  and their interpretations  may also change in the future 
any adverse interpretations or changes could force us to restructure our relationships with physicians  professional corporations or our hospital customers  or to restructure our operations 
this could cause our operating costs to increase significantly 
a restructuring could also result in a loss of contracts or a reduction in revenue under existing contracts 
moreover  if we are required to modify our structure and organization to comply with these laws and rules  our financing agreements may prohibit such modifications and require us to obtain the consent of the holders of such debt or require the refinancing of such debt 
our contracts with healthcare facilities and marketing practices are subject to the federal anti kickback statute  and we recently entered into a settlement for alleged violations of that statute 
we are subject to the federal anti kickback statute  which prohibits the knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for  or to induce  the referral of business or ordering of services paid for by medicare or other federal programs 
remuneration potentially includes discounts and in kind goods or services  as well as cash 
certain federal courts have held that the anti kickback statute can be violated if one purpose of a payment is to induce referrals 
violations of the anti kickback statute can result in imprisonment  civil or criminal fines or exclusion from medicare and other governmental programs 
in  the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  or the oig  issued an advisory opinion indicating that discounts provided to health facilities on the transports for which they are financially responsible potentially violate the anti kickback statute when the ambulance company also receives referrals of medicare and other government funded transports from the facility 
the oig has clarified that not all discounts violate the anti kickback statute  but that the statute may be violated if part of the purpose of the discount is to induce the referral of the transports paid for by medicare or other federal programs  and the discount does not meet certain safe harbor conditions 
in the advisory opinion and subsequent pronouncements  the oig has provided guidance to ambulance companies to help them avoid unlawful discounts 
see item  business regulatory matters federal anti kickback statute 
like other ambulance companies  we have provided discounts to our healthcare facility customers nursing home and hospital in certain circumstances 
we have attempted to comply with applicable law when such discounts are provided 
however  the government alleged that certain of our hospital and nursing home contracts in effect in texas in periods prior to contained discounts in violation of the federal anti kickback statute  and in we entered into a settlement with the government regarding these allegations 
the settlement included a cia 
there can be no assurance that other investigations or legal action related to our contracting practices will not be pursued against amr in other jurisdictions or for different time frames 
see item  business american medical response legal matters 
if we are found to have violated the anti kickback statute  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties  including exclusion from the medicare or medicaid programs  or may be required to enter into settlement agreements with the government to avoid such sanctions 
typically  such settlement agreements require substantial payments to the government in exchange for the government to release its claims  and may also require us to enter into a cia 
see item  business regulatory matters corporate compliance program and corporate integrity obligations 
in addition to amr s contracts with healthcare facilities  other marketing practices or transactions entered into by amr and emcare may implicate the anti kickback statute 
although we have attempted to structure our past and current marketing initiatives and business relationships to comply with the anti kickback statute  we cannot assure you that the oig or other authorities will not find that our marketing practices and relationships violate the statute 
changes in our ownership structure and operations require us to comply with numerous notification and reapplication requirements in order to maintain our licensure  certification or other authority to operate  and failure to do so  or an allegation that we have failed to do so  can result in payment delays  forfeiture of payment or civil and criminal penalties 
we and our affiliated physicians are subject to various federal  state and local licensing and certification laws with which we must comply in order to maintain authorization to provide  or receive payment for  our services 
for example  medicare and medicaid require that we complete and periodically update enrollment forms in order to obtain and maintain certification to participate in programs 
compliance with these requirements is complicated by the fact that they differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  and in some cases are not uniformly applied or interpreted even within the same jurisdiction 
failure to comply with these requirements can lead not only to delays in payment and refund requests  but in extreme cases can give rise to civil or criminal penalties 
in certain jurisdictions  changes in our ownership structure require pre or post notification to governmental licensing and certification agencies  or agencies with which we have contracts 
relevant laws in some jurisdictions may also require re application or re enrollment and approval to maintain or renew our licensure  certification  contracts or other operating authority 
the change in corporate structure and ownership in connection with our initial public offering required us to give notice  re enroll or make other applications for authority to continue operating in various jurisdictions or to continue receiving payment from their medicaid or other payment programs 
while we have made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with these requirements  we cannot assure you that the agencies that administer these programs or have awarded us contracts will not find that we have failed to comply in some material respects 
a finding of non compliance and any resulting payment delays  refund demands or other sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to comply with the terms of our settlement agreements with the government  we could be subject to additional litigation or other governmental actions which could be harmful to our business 
in the last four years  we have entered into five settlement agreements with the united states government 
in june  one of our subsidiaries  amr of massachusetts  entered into a settlement agreement to resolve a number of allegations  including allegations related to billing and documentation practices 
in february  another subsidiary  amr of south dakota  entered into a settlement agreement to resolve allegations that it incorrectly billed for transports performed by other providers when an amr paramedic accompanied the patient during transport  and that it billed for certain non emergency transports using emergency codes 
in july  our subsidiary  american medical response west  entered into a settlement agreement in connection with billing matters related to emergency transports and specialized services 
in august  amr entered into a settlement agreement on behalf of a subsidiary  regional emergency services lp  or res  to resolve allegations of violations of the false claims act by res and a hospital system based on the absence of certificates of medical necessity and other non compliant billing practices 
in september  amr entered into a settlement agreement to resolve allegations that amr subsidiaries provided discounts to healthcare facilities in texas in periods prior to in violation of the federal anti kickback statute 
see item  legal proceedings 
as part of the settlement amr west entered into with the government  we entered into a corporate integrity agreement  or cia  which is still in effect 
pursuant to this cia  we are required to establish and maintain a compliance program which includes  among other elements  the appointment of a compliance officer and committee  review by an independent review organization  and reporting of overpayments and other reportable events 
in connection with the september settlement for amr  we also entered into a cia which requires us to maintain a compliance program which includes the training of employees and safeguards involving our contracting process nationwide including tracking of contractual arrangements in texas 
amr of massachusetts entered into a cia in connection with its june settlement  the term of which has expired 
see item  business regulatory matters corporate compliance program and corporate integrity obligations 
we cannot assure you that the cias or the compliance program we have initiated has prevented  or will prevent  any repetition of the conduct or allegations that were the subject of these settlement agreements  or that the government will not raise similar allegations in other jurisdictions or for other periods of time 
if such allegations are raised  or if we fail to comply with the terms of the cias  we may be subject to fines and other contractual and regulatory remedies specified in the cias or by applicable laws  including exclusion from the medicare program and other federal and state healthcare programs 
such actions could have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business  our financial condition or our results of operations 
if we are unable to effectively adapt to changes in the healthcare industry  our business may be harmed 
political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the united states to fundamental change 
we anticipate that congress and state legislatures may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation effecting fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system 
we cannot assure you as to the ultimate content  timing or effect of changes  nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation 
further  it is possible that future legislation enacted by congress or state legislatures could adversely affect our business or could change the operating environment of our customers 
it is possible that changes to the medicare or other government reimbursement programs may serve as precedent to similar changes in other payors reimbursement policies in a manner adverse to us 
similarly  changes in private payor reimbursement programs could lead to adverse changes in medicare and other government payor programs which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risk factors related to our corporate governance our certificate of incorporation and our by laws contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors 
these provisions include providing for a classified board of directors with staggered terms  providing for the class b special voting stock which will be voted as directed by the onex entities  providing for multi vote shares of common stock which  upon exchange of lp exchangeable units  will be owned by the onex entities  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings  and the authority of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  up to million shares of preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and an additional million shares of common stock

as a result  we qualify for  and rely upon  the controlled company exception to the board of directors and committee composition requirements under the rules of the nyse 
pursuant to this exception  we are exempt from rules that would otherwise require that our board of directors be comprised of a majority of independent directors  and that our compensation committee and corporate governance and nominating committee be comprised solely of independent directors as defined under the rules of the nyse  so long as the onex entities continue to own more than of our combined voting power
