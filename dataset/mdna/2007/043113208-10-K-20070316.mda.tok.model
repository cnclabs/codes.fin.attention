item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our profitability is primarily attributable to the sale of water by artesian water  which comprises of total operating revenues  the amount of which is subject to seasonal fluctuations  particularly during summer when water demand may vary with rainfall and temperature 
in the event temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected  or rainfall is greater than expected  the demand for water may decrease and our revenues may be adversely affected 
we believe the effects of weather are short term and do not materially affect the execution of our strategic initiatives 
our water sales revenues were affected in   and by rate increases associated with two separate base rate applications with the delaware public service commission psc 
in february  we requested an increase in rates of 
we recognized revenues reflecting a temporary increase of million on an annual basis between april and september  and a second temporary increase of million on an annual basis effective september  for a total of million on an annual basis 
a portion of the second increase was held in reserve based on an estimated outcome and was not reflected in income 
in may  the psc issued the final order in this case 
based on the psc decision  artesian water s new rates would generate approximately million in additional revenue on an annual basis  or an increase of approximately over rates in effect before the implementation of temporary rates in we were required by law to refund the portion of the temporary rate increase in excess of the plus interest to our customers 
the refund was completed in december in may  artesian water filed a petition with the psc to implement new rates to meet a requested increase in revenue of  or approximately million  on an annualized basis 
this request was primarily due to the company s significant investment in infrastructure  as well as an approximately increase in purchased power expense due to the expiration of price caps imposed in when deregulation of the electric industry in delaware was adopted 
as permitted by law  in july we placed into effect temporary rates designed to generate an increase in annual operating revenue of approximately  or million on an annual basis  until new rates were approved by the psc 
on december  the psc approved a settlement agreement in this case 
the increase in annual revenue requirement under the settlement agreement of million will be recovered in two steps 
the first step was placed in effect january  to generate approximately million in annual revenue 
the second step will be designed to generate approximately million of annual revenue reflecting the issuance of additional equity not to exceed million 
however  should the company issue less than the projected million in equity  the increase will be adjusted to reflect the change in return associated with the company s capital structure 
artesian water pennsylvania  our wholly owned pennsylvania water utility subsidiary  began operations in  providing water service to a residential community in chester county  consisting of customers 
in  the pennsylvania public utilities commission approved our application to increase our service area to encompass four specific developments that are expected to add customers over years 
our other regulated subsidiary  artesian wastewater  is an entity that owns wastewater infrastructure and began providing wastewater services in delaware in july our wastewater customers are billed a flat monthly fee  which contributes to providing a revenue stream unaffected by weather 
as of december  artesian wastewater had customers in five communities 
our other subsidiaries  neither of which is regulated  are artesian utility  which designs and builds wastewater infrastructure  provides contract wastewater services in delaware and provides contract water and wastewater services outside delaware  and artesian development  whose sole activity  after the sale of approximately four acres in  is the ownership of a six acre parcel of land 
the sale of the four acre parcel of land in september 
table of contents resulted in a gain on sale of land of approximately million 
in addition to services discussed above  artesian resources initiated a service line protection plan  or slp plan  in march the slp plan covers all parts  material and labor required to repair or replace participants leaking water service lines up to an annual limit 
as of december   approximately of our eligible water customers had signed up for the slp plan 
on february   artesian resources entered an agreement on the terms of purchase with carpenters point water company carpenters point 
carpenters point currently serves a home community in cecil county  maryland near the interstate growth corridor between philadelphia and baltimore 
the proposed acquisition is expected to provide sufficient groundwater supply and elevated water storage to serve additional customers in the undeveloped portions of the carpenters point franchise and surrounding area 
the purchase is subject to a number of conditions  including the completion of artesian resources due diligence  execution of definitive agreements and approvals by appropriate state regulatory agencies  including the maryland public service commission and the maryland department of the environment 
if the conditions are satisfied  we expect the acquisition will be completed in cecil county has designated the interstate corridor as a preferred growth area for business and residential expansion 
recently  the federal base re alignment and closure commission announced the relocation of approximately  jobs to nearby aberdeen  maryland by the wilmington metropolitan area planning commission projects cecil county will grow at a rate of percent between and and the maryland department of planning projects that cecil county will experience the highest rate of household growth through of any jurisdiction in the state 
while water sales revenues are our primary source of revenues  we continue to explore and develop relationships with developers and municipalities in order to increase revenues from contract water operations provided by artesian water and from wastewater management services provided by both artesian wastewater and artesian utility 
our contract operations and wastewater management services provide a revenue stream that is not affected by changes in weather patterns 
we plan to continue developing and expanding our contract operations and wastewater services in a manner that complements our growth in water service to new customers 
our anticipated growth in these areas is subject to changes in residential and commercial construction  which may be affected by interest rates  inflation and general housing and economic market conditions 
we will continue to focus attention on expanding our contract operations opportunities with municipalities and private water providers in delaware and surrounding areas 
ensuring our customers have a dependable supply of safe  high quality water has been  and will continue to be  our highest priority 
in  delaware passed legislation requiring all water utilities to certify by july that they have sufficient sources of self supply to serve their respective systems 
we believe we have made the appropriate investment in infrastructure and on march   we filed our certification of self sufficiency of supply with the psc 
the review was completed on june   and the psc concluded that we demonstrated that we have sufficient water supply to meet the demands of our customers through also on june   artesian water provided the city of wilmington  delaware city with notice of non renewal of the interconnection agreement with the city upon its december  termination 
artesian water is no longer required to purchase million gallons annually from the city after december  at rates  that obligation was approximately  as required by law  on june   we filed with the psc a new certification of self sufficiency for the period through  which is currently under review by the psc 
water industry the federal environmental protection agency s may report states that the united states water industry is comprised of approximately  community water systems  of which serve less than  customers 
only of all community water systems are run by investor owned utilities 
there are currently publicly traded water utilities based in the united states 
the rest are privately or municipally owned systems 
the water industry is capital intensive  with the highest capital investment in plant and equipment per dollar of revenue among all utilities 
increasingly stringent drinking water regulations to meet the requirements of the safe drinking water act of have required the water industry to invest in more advanced treatment systems and processes  which require a heightened level of expertise 
we are currently in full compliance with the requirements of the safe drinking 
table of contents water act 
even though our water utility was founded in  the majority of our investment in infrastructure occurred in the last years 
we believe that delaware s generally lower cost of living in the region  availability of development sites in relatively close proximity to the atlantic ocean in sussex county  and attractive financing rates for construction and mortgages have resulted  and will continue to result  in increases to our customer base 
according to the us census bureau  delaware s population increased an estimated from to  as compared to the nationwide growth rate of approximately 
substantial portions of delaware are not served by a public water system 
interest rates for mortgages have fallen from on average in december to through december long term interest rates for our recent first mortgage bond issuance see note to our financial statements reflect a similar trend  as we were able to reduce our overall weighted cost of debt from in to at the end of strategic direction we believe the effects of weather are short term and do not materially affect the execution of our strategic initiatives 
as we anticipated  our initiatives south of the chesapeake delaware canal  or the c d canal  that began in are now providing the greatest portion of our customer growth 
this shift in growth is primarily the result of the build out of our service area in northern new castle county 
in  we increased our customer base by and increased our service territory by approximately square miles  a increase 
we continued to increase our sources of supply  adding about million gallons to our daily production capacity  to assure we have adequate high quality water supply to meet our customer growth expectations 
our strategy is to focus on total resource management covering a wide spectrum of activities  which include identifying new and dependable sources of supply  developing the wells  treatment plants and delivery systems to get water to the customers  educating customers on the wise use of water  and providing responsible wastewater management to assist with recharge of the aquifers 
our strategy includes focusing our efforts to expand in new regions added to our service territory over the last years  where growth is strong and demand is increasing 
these regions have provided approximately of our growth in customers in and we expect growth to remain strong in these regions 
we also foresee significant growth opportunities in our wastewater subsidiaries and will continue to seek strategic partnerships and relationships with developers and municipalities to complement existing agreements for the provision of wastewater service in delaware and surrounding areas 
regulatory matters and inflation as of december   we had approximately  metered water customers  wastewater customers  and served a population of approximately  including contract services  representing approximately of delaware s total population 
increases in the number of customers served by artesian water and artesian wastewater contribute to increases in our operating revenues 
the psc regulates both artesian water s and artesian wastewater s rates charged for service  the sale and issuance of securities and other matters 
we periodically seek rate increases to cover the cost of increased operating expenses  increased financing expenses due to additional investments in utility plant and other costs of doing business 
in delaware  utilities are permitted by law to place rates into effect  under bond  on a temporary basis pending completion of a rate increase proceeding 
the first temporary increase may be up to the lesser of million on an annual basis or of gross water sales 
should the rate case not be completed within seven months  by law  the utility may put the entire requested rate relief  up to of gross water sales  in effect under bond until a final resolution is ordered and placed into effect 
if any such rates are found to be in excess of rates the psc finds to be appropriate  the utility must refund the portion found to be in excess to customers with interest 
the timing of our rate increase requests are therefore dependent upon the estimated cost of the administrative process in relation to the investments and expenses that we hope to recover through the rate increase 
we can provide no assurances that rate increase requests will be approved by applicable regulatory agencies  and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that these rate increases will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase 
delaware statute permits water utilities to put into effect  on a semi annual basis  increases related to specific types of distribution system improvements through a distribution system improvement charge or dsic 
this charge is available to water utilities to be implemented between general rate increase applications that normally recognize changes in a water utility s overall financial position 
the dsic approval process is less costly when compared to 
table of contents the approval process for general rate increase requests 
on november   we requested from the psc an increase to the dsic surcharge from to for bills rendered subsequent to january  the surcharge generated approximately  in revenues between january and june of as required by law  this charge was set to zero when the temporary rate increase from our general rate case filed in may was put into effect in july in  the general assembly passed legislation restructuring the electric industry in delaware 
since the passage of electric restructuring legislation in  electricity prices had been capped for customers of delmarva power and the delaware electric cooperative 
those rate caps were lifted in for customers of the delaware electric cooperative and in may for delmarva power customers 
our electric charges increased in due to higher billing rates charged by delaware electric cooperative after the cap was removed 
in  our electric charges increased further due to the increase from delmarva power 
artesian sought to mitigate future increases by signing a two year fixed price supply contract with pepco energy services 
on april   the psc made effective new regulations docket that governs the terms and conditions under which water utilities require advances or contributions from customers or developers 
these regulations require that developers pay for all water facilities within a new development  with such funding recorded as contributions in aid of construction by the water utility 
in addition  the utility is required to receive a contribution in aid of construction of  for each new residential connection to its system towards the cost of water supply  treatment and storage facilities 
these required contributions are intended to place a greater burden upon new customers to pay for the cost of facilities required to serve them 
we are affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve and expand our service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility costs compared to investments made to years ago  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
critical accounting policies all additions to plant are recorded at cost 
cost includes direct labor  materials  and indirect charges for such items as transportation  supervision  pension  medical  and other fringe benefits related to employees engaged in construction activities 
when depreciable units of utility plant are retired  the cost of retired property  together with any cost associated with retirement and less any salvage value or proceeds received  is charged to accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs  and replacement of minor items of plant are charged to expense as incurred 
we record water service revenue  including amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts  based upon estimated usage from the date of the last meter reading to the end of the accounting period 
these estimates are made on an individual customer basis  based on one of three methods the previous year s consumption in the same period  the previous billing period s consumption  or trending and are adjusted to reflect current changes in water demand on a system wide basis 
while actual usage for individual customers may differ materially from the estimate  we believe the overall total estimate of consumption and revenue for the fiscal period will not differ materially from actual billed consumption  as the overall estimate has been adjusted to reflect any change in overall demand on the system for the period 
we record accounts receivable at the invoiced amounts 
the reserve for bad debts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable  and is determined based on a five year historical write off experience 
the company reviews the reserve for bad debts on a quarterly basis 
account balances are written off against the reserve when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we review for impairment of our long lived assets  including utility plant in service  in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we also review regulatory assets for the continued application of sfas no 
our review determines whether there have been changes in circumstances or events that have occurred that require adjustments to the carrying value of these assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 adjustments to the carrying value of these assets would be made in instances where the inclusion in the rate making process is unlikely 
our regulated utilities record deferred regulatory assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which are costs that may be recovered over various lengths of time as prescribed by the psc 
as the utility incurs certain costs  such as expenses related to rate case 
table of contents applications  a deferred regulatory asset is created 
adjustments to these deferred regulatory assets are made when the psc determines whether the expense is recoverable in rates  the length of time over which an expense is recoverable  or  because of changes in circumstances  whether a remaining balance of deferred expense is recoverable in rates charged to customers 
adjustments to reflect changes in recoverability of certain deferred regulatory assets may have a material effect on our financial results 
results of operations compared to operating revenues revenues totaled million in and were above revenues in of million  which is primarily due to an increase of million  or in water sales revenue  and the million proceeds from the sale of land by artesian development 
the increase in water sales revenue reflects a increase in the number of customers served  rate increases placed in effect in  and an adjustment in the fourth quarter reflecting the difference between estimated and actual customer refunds associated with the rate case
