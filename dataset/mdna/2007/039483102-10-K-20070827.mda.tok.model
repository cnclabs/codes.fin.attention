item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued payments due by period contractual note less than over obligations reference total year years years years in millions purchases inventories energy other total purchases short term debt note long term debt note estimated interest payments operating leases note estimated pension and other postretirement plan contributions note total at june   the company estimates it will spend approximately billion over the next four years to complete approved capital projects and acquisitions 
the company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets 
at june   the company s carrying value of these limited partnership investments was million 
the company has future capital commitments related to these partnerships of million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments  if called for  to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships 
the company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of million at june  in addition  the company has entered into agreements  primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees  which could obligate the company to make future payments 
the company s liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation 
the company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations 
at june   these contingent obligations totaled approximately million 
amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were million at june  critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical  as these policies are important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management 
management has discussed with the company s audit committee the development  selection  disclosure  and application of these critical accounting policies 
following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the company s financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inventories and derivatives certain of the company s merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories  forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded futures and options contracts are valued at estimated market values 
these merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded  have quoted market prices  and may be sold without significant additional processing 
management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets 
changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold 
if management used different methods or factors to estimate market value  amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ 
the company  from time to time  uses derivative contracts to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month  to fix the purchase price of the company s anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities  and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol 
these derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 
the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been  and is expected to continue to be  highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item 
gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income  net of applicable income taxes  and recognized as a component of cost of products sold in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 
if it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item  then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold 
employee benefit plans the company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits 
the company also provides substantially all domestic salaried employees with postretirement health care and life insurance benefits 
in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans  management makes several estimates and assumptions  including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities  rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  and anticipated future health care costs 
these estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience combined with management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
management also uses third party specialists to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans 
if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly  and the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
income taxes the company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company records reserves for probable exposures 
deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns  and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the company s income statement 
realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the company s tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable 
based on management s evaluation of the company s tax position  it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued 
to the extent the company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued undistributed earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested  and accordingly  no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon 
if the company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested  the company could be subject to us tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
asset abandonments and write downs the company is principally engaged in the business of procuring  transporting  storing  processing  and merchandising agricultural commodities and products 
this business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive 
both the availability of the company s raw materials and the demand for the company s finished products are driven by unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government domestic and foreign farm programs and policies  changes in population growth  changes in standards of living  and production of similar and competitive crops 
these aforementioned unpredictable factors  therefore  may cause a shift in the supply demand dynamics for the company s raw materials and finished products 
any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and profitability of the company s fixed asset base in terms of geographic location  size  and age of its factories 
the company  from time to time  will also invest in equipment and technology related to new  value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products 
these new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective 
management evaluates the company s property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
assets are abandoned after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value 
if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of this fixed asset base  then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
valuation of marketable securities and investments in affiliates the company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value 
investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings 
for publicly traded securities  the fair value of the company s investments is readily available based on quoted market prices 
for non publicly traded securities  management s assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds 
in the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value  management may be required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
in evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment  management considers the market conditions  trends of earnings  discounted cash flows  trading volumes  and other key measures of the investment as well as the company s ability and intent to hold the investment 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company s marketable securities and investments in affiliates 
if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities  then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets 
the company accounts for these limited partnerships using the equity method of accounting 
therefore  the company is recording in the consolidated statement of earnings its proportional share of the limited partnerships net income or loss 
the limited partnerships value their investments at fair value 
thus  unrealized gains and losses related to the change in fair value of these investments are recorded in the limited partnerships statements of earnings 
the valuation of these investments  as determined by the general partner  can be subjective  and the values may vary significantly 
some of the factors causing the subjectivity and volatility of these valuations include the illiquidity and minority positions of these investments  currency exchange rate fluctuations  less regulated securities exchanges  and the inherent business risks and limitations present in the emerging market countries 
the company records the results of these limited partnerships based on the information provided to the company by the general partner 
due to the subjectivity and volatility in valuing these investments  the fair value of these investments  and thus the company s results  could vary significantly over future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodities futures prices  marketable equity security prices  market prices of limited partnerships investments  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates as described below 
commodities the availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government domestic and foreign farm programs and policies  changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  the company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts 
the company will also use exchange traded futures and options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins 
the results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities  counterparty contracts defaults  and volatility of freight markets 
in addition  the company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed  or sold  in a future month 
the changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item 
gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes  and recognized as a component of cost of products sold in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of inventories  related purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded futures contracts  including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements 
the fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in such prices 
actual results may differ 
fair value market risk fair value market risk in millions highest long position highest short position average position long short the change in fair value of the average position for compared to was principally a result of changes in the daily net commodity position and commodity prices 
marketable equity securities marketable equity securities  which are recorded at fair value  have exposure to price risk 
the fair value of marketable equity securities is based on quoted market prices 
risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted market prices 
actual results may differ 
in millions fair value market risk the decrease in fair value for compared to resulted primarily from disposals of securities partially offset by increases in fair market value of certain securities 
limited partnerships the company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets 
the company accounts for these limited partnerships using the equity method of accounting 
therefore  the company is recording in the consolidated statement of earnings its proportional share of the limited partnerships net income or loss 
the limited partnerships value their investments at fair value 
risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in market prices of the limited partnerships investments 
actual results may differ 
in millions fair value of partnerships investments market risk the decrease in fair value for compared to resulted primarily from returns of capital 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued currencies in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  except for amounts permanently invested as described below  the company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities 
the instruments used are readily marketable exchange traded futures contracts and forward contracts with banks 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions 
the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material 
the amount the company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is billion at june   and billion at june  this increase is due to an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and appreciation of foreign currency exchange rates 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is million and million for and  respectively 
actual results may differ 
interest the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices  where available  and discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value 
market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 
decrease in interest rates 
actual results may differ 
in millions fair value of long term debt excess of fair value over carrying value market risk the increase in fair value of long term debt in resulted principally from the company s issuance of billion convertible senior notes partially offset by repayment of million of debentures and other principal payments of long term debt
