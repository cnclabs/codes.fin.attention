overview we are a multi line healthcare enterprise operating in two segments 
our medicaid managed care segment provides medicaid and medicaid related programs to organizations and individuals through government subsidized programs  including medicaid  the state children s health insurance program  or schip  and  supplemental security income  or ssi 
our specialty services segment provides specialty services  including behavioral health  disease management  long term care programs  managed vision  nurse triage  pharmacy benefits management and treatment compliance  to state programs  healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations  as well as to our own subsidiaries on market based terms 
during  we were notified by the kansas health policy authority that our medicaid contract in kansas would not be renewed beyond december   and we reached a definitive agreement to sell the operating assets of firstguard health plan  inc  our missouri health plan

over the last two years we have experienced membership and revenue growth in our medicaid managed care segment including membership growth of 
excluding our membership in kansas and missouri from the total membership as of december   our membership growth was 
the following new contracts and acquisitions contributed to our growth effective september   we began operating under a new contract and expanded operations in texas to include  medicaid and schip members in the corpus christi  austin and lubbock markets 
in georgia  we began managing care for medicaid and schip members in the atlanta and central regions effective june  and southwest region effective september  at december   our membership in georgia was  we began operating under new contracts with the state of ohio to manage care for  medicaid members by entering seven new counties in the east central market on july   and new counties in the northwest market on october  effective june   we acquired mediplan corporation  or mediplan  and began managing care for an additional  members in ohio 
the results of operations of this entity are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning june  effective may   we acquired the operating assets of summacare  inc the results of operations of this entity are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning may  we have been awarded the following new contracts to expand our operations in ohio and texas during the second quarter of  we were awarded a contract in texas to provide managed care for ssi recipients in the san antonio and corpus christi markets 
membership operations commenced in february during  we received notification of an award in ohio to provide managed care for medicaid aged  blind or disabled  or abd  members in four regions 
operations commenced in the northeast and southwest regions on january and february   respectively 
implementation is expected to take place in the northwest region in march and in the east central region in april 
table of contents our specialty services segment has experienced significant year over year growth largely because of the acquisition of us script 
the following new contracts and acquisitions contributed to our growth effective october   we began performing under our contract with the arizona health care cost containment system to provide long term care services in the maricopa  yuma and lapaz counties in arizona 
effective july   we acquired the managed vision business of opticare managed vision  inc  or opticare 
the results of operations of this entity are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning july  effective may   we acquired cardium health services corporation  or cardium  a disease management company

results of operations and key metrics summarized comparative financial data for  and are as follows in millions change change premium revenue service revenue total revenues medical costs cost of services general and administrative expenses impairment loss earnings loss from operations investment and other income  net earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense net earnings loss diluted earnings loss per common share revenues and revenue recognition our medicaid managed care segment generates revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate health plans 
we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts 
we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
some states enact premium taxes or similar assessments  collectively  premium taxes  and these taxes are recorded as g a expenses 
some contracts allow for additional premium related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states  which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data 
these adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 
our specialty services segment generates revenues under contracts with state programs  healthcare organizations  and other commercial organizations  as well as from our own subsidiaries on market based terms 
revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 
premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue 
for performance based contracts  we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 
premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts 
as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided  the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents our total revenue increased in the year ended december  over the previous year primarily through membership growth in the medicaid managed care segment  premium rate increases  and growth in our specialty services segment 
membership growth from december  to december   we increased our total membership by or if we exclude our membership in kansas and missouri at december  the following table sets forth our membership by state in our medicaid managed care segment december  georgia indiana new jersey ohio texas wisconsin subtotal kansas missouri total the following table sets forth our membership by line of business in our medicaid managed care segment december  medicaid schip ssi subtotal kansas and missouri medicaid schip members total during  our subsidiary  peach state health plan  commenced operations in the atlanta and central regions of georgia in june and in the southwest region in september 
we increased our membership in ohio through the mediplan acquisition while also adding members under our new contract in the east central and northwest markets 
in texas  we increased our membership through new contracts in the corpus christi  austin  and lubbock markets 
our membership decreased in wisconsin because of more stringent state eligibility requirements for the medicaid and schip programs and eligibility administration issues 
our membership decreased in indiana primarily due to provider terminations 
the revenue associated with our kansas and missouri health plans was and million in and  respectively 
in  we increased our membership in ohio through our acquisition of the medicaid related assets of summacare  inc our membership increased in indiana  new jersey and wisconsin from additions to our provider networks  expansion into ssi in wisconsin  increases in counties served and growth in the overall number of medicaid beneficiaries 
in kansas  we increased our membership by eliminating a ceiling on our membership total with the state 
our membership decreased in missouri and texas because of more stringent eligibility requirements for the medicaid and schip programs 
premium rate increases in  we received premium rate increases ranging from to  or on a composite basis across our markets 
in  we received premium rate increases ranging from to  or on a composite basis across our markets 
specialty services segment growth in  we began performing under our behavioral health contracts with the states of arizona and kansas 
in july  we began offering disease management services through our acquisition of airlogix 
in january  we began offering pharmacy benefits management through our acquisition of us script  representing most of the increase in service revenue 
additionally  in may  we expanded our disease management services through our acquisition of cardium 
in july  we began offering managed vision care through our acquisition of opticare 
in october  our subsidiary  bridgeway health solutions began performing under our long term care contract in arizona 
the increase in service revenue reflects the acquisitions of us script airlogix  and cardium 
at december   our behavioral health company  cenpatico  provided behavioral health services to 
table of contents  members in arizona and  members in kansas  compared to  members in arizona and  members in kansas  at december  operating expenses medical costs our medical costs include payments to physicians  hospitals  and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims 
medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr  and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience 
as part of this review  we also consider the costs to process medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in physician billing patterns  membership  products and inpatient hospital trends 
these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available 
we employ actuarial professionals and use the services of independent actuaries who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly 
while we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is actuarially sound  we cannot assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 
our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses related to health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred 
our health benefits ratio  or hbr  represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 
the table below depicts our hbr for our external membership by member category year ended december  medicaid and schip ssi specialty services our medicaid and schip hbr for the year ended december  was  an increase of over the hbr for the year ended december  included million for settlement of a lawsuit with aurora health care  inc  or aurora  a provider of medical professional services to our wisconsin health plan 
this settlement increased the hbr for the year ended december  the increase in hbr for the year ended december  is caused primarily by increased cost trends for maternity related costs including neonatal intensive care costs  increased physician costs  and increased pharmacy costs 
our specialty services hbr for includes twelve months of the behavioral health contracts in arizona and kansas  six months of opticare and three months of bridgeway 
the results include twelve months of our behavioral health contract in kansas and six months of arizona results 
our medicaid and schip hbr increased in due to our settlement of a lawsuit with aurora and expansion into new markets previously unmanaged by us 
for example  we experienced higher cost trends in indiana where we added membership in as the state expanded their medicaid managed care program to include all medicaid and schip enrollees 
cost of services our cost of services expense includes all direct costs to support the local functions responsible for generation of our services revenues 
these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals and teachers who provide the services and expenses related to facilities and equipment used to provide services 
cost of services also includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pbm s external revenues 
cost of services rose million for the year ended december   over the comparable period in the increase in cost of services reflects the acquisitions of us script  airlogix  and cardium 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative  or g a  expenses primarily reflect wages and benefits  including stock compensation expense  and other administrative costs related to our health plans  specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units 
our major centralized functions are finance  information systems and claims processing 
premium taxes are also classified as g a expenses 
g a expenses increased in the year ended december  over the comparable period in primarily due to expenses for additional facilities and staff to support our growth  especially in arizona and georgia  an increase in premium taxes  the adoption of sfas r on january  and the exit costs for our firstguard operations 
premium taxes totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the results for the year ended december   include million of implementation expenses in georgia  million of additional stock compensation expense and million of firstguard exit costs 

table of contents our g a expense ratio represents g a expenses as a percentage of total revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues 
the following table sets forth the g a expense ratios by business segment year ended december  medicaid managed care specialty services the increase in the medicaid managed care g a expense ratio in primarily reflects the increase in premium taxes  the adoption of sfas r and exit costs of our firstguard operations offset by the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues 
the decrease in the medicaid managed care g a expense ratio in reflects the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues and lower compensation costs related to our performance bonus plans 
these factors were partially offset by implementation costs in georgia of million  higher spending on information systems process improvements and increased charitable contributions 
the specialty services g a ratio varies depending on the nature of the services provided and will generally be higher than the medicaid managed care g a expense ratio 
the results reflect the operations of our behavioral health company in arizona  the acquisitions of us script and airlogix  as well as the acquisition of cardium effective may   and opticare effective july  the results for the year ended december  include approximately million in implementation costs related to our long term care contract in arizona 
the results reflect the operations of our behavioral health company in arizona  including million in implementation costs  and million in georgia implementation costs 
in  we reassessed the calculations used to determine the proportion of certain costs allocated among each of our two segments 
this assessment included an evaluation of whether the costs should be allocated based on revenue  number of claims  or headcount measures and altered the proportion of certain g a costs 
the altered percentages resulted in the allocation of an additional million to the medicaid managed care segment for the year ended december  than would have been allocated under the previous formulas 
other income expense other income expense consists principally of investment income from our cash and investments and interest expense on our debt 
investment and other income increased million in primarily as a result of an increase in market interest rates and larger investment balances 
interest expense increased million primarily from increased borrowings under our credit facilities 
income tax expense we recorded million of income tax expense in despite having a million pre tax loss because the million goodwill impairment loss is not deductible for income tax purposes 
excluding the goodwill impairment  our effective tax rate was compared to for the corresponding period in the effective tax rate included lower expense resulting from the resolution of state income tax examinations and the recognition of deferred tax benefits related to a change in law 
impairment loss in august  firstguard health plan kansas  inc  or firstguard kansas  our wholly owned subsidiary  received notification from the kansas health policy authority that its medicaid contract scheduled to terminate december  would not be renewed 
we appealed this decision and initiated litigation in an attempt to renew this medicaid contract 
these actions were unsuccessful and the contract terminated december  in  we also evaluated the strategic alternatives for our firstguard missouri health plan and decided to divest the business 
the sale of the operating assets of firstguard missouri was completed effective february  firstguard kansas and firstguard missouri are reported in the medicaid managed care segment 
as a result of the notification from the kansas health policy authority  we conducted an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of the firstguard reporting unit  which encompassed both the firstguard kansas and firstguard missouri health plans 
the fair value of the firstguard reporting unit was determined using discounted expected cash flows and estimated market value 
the impairment analysis resulted in a goodwill impairment of million recorded as impairment loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
the goodwill impairment is not deductible for tax purposes  however  a tax benefit for the stock of firstguard kansas may be realized in the cash proceeds in from the firstguard missouri sale and tax benefit for the stock of firstguard kansas are estimated to total between and million 

table of contents earnings per share and shares outstanding our earnings per share calculations in reflect lower diluted weighted average shares outstanding resulting from the exclusion of the effect of outstanding stock awards which would be anti dilutive to net earnings 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our activities primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our total operating activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in the increase in cash flow from operations in reflects an increase in medical claims liabilities primarily from the commencement of our operations in georgia and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
those increases are partially offset by an increase in premium and related receivables in that reflect an increase in maternity delivery receivables  reimbursements due to us from providers including amounts due under capitated risk sharing contracts and the inclusion of us script receivables 
cash flow from operations in reflects an increase in premium and related receivables and a million increase in medical claims liabilities 
the increase in receivables resulted primarily from the timing of delivery receivable collections 
the increase in medical claims liabilities  lower than in prior years  reflects the million payment made to aurora to settle a lawsuit  information systems improvements to reduce our claims processing cycle time and the effect of our behavioral health contract in arizona 
our investing activities used cash of million in  million in and million in during  our investing activities primarily consisted of the acquisitions of us script  cardium  mediplan  and opticare 
our investing activities in also included additions to the investment portfolios of our regulated subsidiaries 
during  our investing activities primarily consisted of the acquisitions of airlogix and the operating assets of summacare  inc our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our investment guidelines 
net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases  sales and maturities 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities with an average duration of years 
cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds  corporate bonds  insurance contracts  commercial paper and instruments of the us treasury 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our regulated subsidiaries may invest their cash 
we spent million  million and million in  and  respectively  on capital assets consisting primarily of software and hardware upgrades  and furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements related to office and market expansions 
the expenditures in included million for computer hardware and software 
we anticipate spending million on additional capital expenditures in primarily related to system upgrades and market expansions 
the expenditures in also included million to purchase several properties contiguous to our corporate headquarters as part of our redevelopment agreement with the city of clayton  missouri 
we anticipate spending approximately million for additional property in clayton  missouri related to this agreement 
in the second quarter of  our subsidiary executed a three year  million non recourse revolving credit facility to finance the property already acquired or expected to be acquired under the redevelopment agreement 
as of december  we had million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
our primary purpose for the redevelopment agreement is to accommodate office expansion needs for future company growth 
the total scope of the project includes building two new office towers and street level retail space 
we plan to occupy a portion of those towers 
the total expected cost of the project is approximately million 
it is not our intent to serve as developer of the project or finance the project construction costs 
our financing activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in during and  our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility 
these borrowings were used primarily for our investing activities in conjunction with the acquisition of summacare  airlogix  us script  cardium and mediplan 
at december   we had working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  of million as compared to million at december  we manage our short term and long term investments to ensure that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short term capital requirements as needed 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  and million at december  long term investments were million at december  and million at december   including restricted deposits of million and million  respectively 
at december   cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled million while cash and investments held by our regulated entities totaled million 
in september  we executed an amendment to our revolving credit agreement 
the amendment increases the total amount available under the credit agreement to million from million  including a sub facility for letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to million 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates  the federal funds rate or the prime rate 
there is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the agreement that ranges from to depending on the 
table of contents total debt to ebitda ratio 
the agreement contains non financial and financial covenants  including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  maximum debt to ebitda ratios and minimum tangible net worth

as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
we have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to four million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase program extends through october   but we reserve the right to suspend or discontinue the program at any time 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares at an average price of 
we have established a trading plan with a registered broker to repurchase shares under certain market conditions 
we have a shelf registration statement on form s on file with the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  covering the issuance of up to million of securities including common stock and debt securities 
no securities have been issued under the shelf registration 
we may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
based on our operating plan  we expect that our available cash  cash equivalents and investments  cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures for at least months from the date of this filing 
additionally  the cash and investments in our kansas and missouri health plans are sufficient to satisfy the remaining liabilities 
we expect the excess funds will become available to us for general corporate purposes when our regulatory obligations have been satisfied 
our principal contractual obligations at december  consisted of medical claims liabilities  debt  operating leases and purchase obligations 
our debt consists of borrowings from our credit facilities  mortgages and capital leases 
the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance contracts in addition to agreements pertaining to the expansion of our corporate headquarters 
the contractual obligations over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years medical claims liabilities debt operating leases purchase obligations total regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our medicaid managed care operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
as managed care organizations  these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate 
as of december   our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of million 
the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum risk based capital requirements for insurance companies  managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage 
as of december   our georgia  indiana  new jersey  ohio  texas and wisconsin health plans were in compliance with the risk based capital requirements enacted in those states 
had kansas or missouri adopted risk based capital requirements  we believe we would be in compliance at december  recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation  or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies whether or not to recognize assets or liabilities for tax positions taken that may be challenged by the taxing authority 
the adoption of fin on january  is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  or eitf the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net 
table of contents basis is an accounting policy decision 
premium taxes and similar assessments are within the scope of eitf we plan to adopt eitf effective january  and will report premium revenues net of premium taxes and similar assessments 
the adoption of eitf is expected to result in lower revenue and general and administrative expenses with no effect on our net earnings  statement of financial position or stockholders equity 
the amount of premium taxes and similar assessments reported in was million 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
our accounting policies regarding medical claims liabilities and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
medical claims liabilities our medical claims liabilities include claims reported but not yet paid  or inventory  estimates for claims incurred but not reported  or ibnr  and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims 
we  together with our independent actuaries  estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice 
these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 
these estimates are continually reviewed each period and adjustments based on actual claim submissions and additional facts and circumstances are reflected in the period known 
our management uses its judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates 
in developing our estimate for ibnr  we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated 
for more recent periods  incurred non inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors 
incurred hospital claims are estimated based on authorized days and historical per diem claim experience adjusted for known factors 
for older periods  we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates 
when we commence operations in a new state or region  we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liabilities 
see risk factors failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our reported results 
the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs 
these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 
the completion factor  claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december  data completion factors cost trend factors decrease increase in factors increase decrease in medical claims liabilities decrease increase in factors increase decrease in medical claims liabilities in thousands in thousands reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liabilities caused by changes in completion factors 
reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liabilities caused by changes in cost trend factors for the most recent periods 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate  it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
for example  a increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liabilities would have affected net earnings by million for the year ended december  the estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 

table of contents the change in medical claims liabilities is summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  balance  january acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid balance  december claims inventory  december days in claims payable days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liabilities at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year 
days in claims payable decreased in due to the settlement of a lawsuit with aurora  information systems improvements to reduce our claims processing cycle time and the effect of our behavioral health contract in arizona 
acquisitions in and include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of opticare and firstguard  respectively 
medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider 
as a result  these liabilities generally are described as having a short tail  which causes less than of our medical claims liabilities as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year 
management expects that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liabilities as of december  will be known by the end of actuarial standards of practice generally require that medical claims liabilities estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions 
moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate 
in many situations  the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years were attributable to favorable development  including changes in medical utilization and cost trends 
these changes in medical utilization and cost trends can be attributable to our margin protection programs and changes in our member demographics 
for all of our membership  we routinely implement new or modified policies that we refer to as our margin protection programs that assist with the control of medical utilization and cost trends such as emergency room policies 
while we try to predict the savings from these programs  actual savings have proven to be better than anticipated  which has contributed to the favorable development of our medical claims liabilities 
intangible assets we have made several acquisitions since that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets 
these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships  purchased contract rights  provider contracts  trade names and goodwill 
at december  we had million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
purchased contract rights are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from five to ten years 
provider contracts are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from five to ten years 
customer relationships are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from five to seven years 
trade names are amortized using the straight line method over years 
our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be permanently impaired  the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the respective acquired entity 
our management must make assumptions and estimates  such as the discount factor  future utility and other internal and external factors  in determining the estimated fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

table of contents goodwill is reviewed every year during the fourth quarter for impairment 
in addition  we will perform an impairment analysis of other intangible assets based on other factors 
these factors would include significant changes in membership  state funding  medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 
in august  firstguard health plan kansas  inc  or firstguard kansas  our wholly owned subsidiary  received notification from the kansas health policy authority that its medicaid contract scheduled to terminate december  would not be renewed 
as a result of these events  we concluded it was necessary to conduct an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of the firstguard reporting unit  which encompasses both the kansas and missouri firstguard health plans 
the fair value of our firstguard reporting unit was determined using discounted expected cash flows and estimated market value 
the impairment analysis resulted in a total non cash intangible asset impairment charge of million  consisting of million of goodwill and million of other identifiable intangible assets  is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  forward looking statements all statements  other than statements of current or historical fact  contained in this filing are forward looking statements
